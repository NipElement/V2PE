She is most famous for her participation, in 1804, in the battle of Pulo Aura. She foundered in 1811 while on her fifth trip.  \n## Career  \n### Voyage #1 (1801–02)  \nCaptain Andrew Patton sailed Ocean for Bombay and China. He had been captain of the company's previous 2, which had wrecked in 1797. Because the French Revolutionary Wars were still on going, Patton acquired a letter of marque, which was dated 10 December 1800.  \nOcean left Portsmouth on 9 January 1801 and reached on 22 May. From there she sailed for China. She reached Whampoa on 6 October. On the return leg she crossed the Second Bar on 7 December. She arrived at Saint Helena on 12 April 1802, and  The Downs on 10 June.  \n<image>A fleet of East Indiamen at Sea, by Nicholas Pocock; it is believed to show the Indiamen  Lord Hawkesbury, Worcester, 2, Fort William, 2, 2, Ocean, 2, Carnatic, 2 and Windham returning from China in 1802\n\n\n### Voyage #2 (1802–04)  \nOn Oceans second voyage, Patton was again her captain and he left The Downs on 13 October 1802 for the Cape of Good Hope, Madras, Bombay and China. After the resumption of war with France in 1803, Patton posthumously received a new letter of marque dated 1 July 1803 for the same vessel, with a crew of 140 men and 36 guns. Patton died at Bombay in June 1803; Oceans first lieutenant, John Christian Lochner, became captain and it was he that commanded her at the battle of Pulo Aura.  \n<image>Ocean can be seen in this printed key for a view of the Battle, showing the China Fleet a painting by Francis Sartorius, the younger after a drawing by an officer on board the Henry Addington\nOn 14 February 1804, the China Fleet, under the command of Commodore Nathaniel Dance, intimidated, drove off and chased a powerful French naval squadron at Pulo Aura. Dance's aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of fire. Dance then chased the French warships until his convoy was out of danger, whereupon he resumed his passage towards British India.  \nOcean reached Britain on 15 August 1804.  \nThe EIC voted a £50,000 prize fund to be divided among the various commanders at the battle and their crews. Farrer received 500 guineas, and also a piece of plate worth 50 guineas. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund and other national and mercantile institutions made a series of awards of ceremonial swords, silver plate, and monetary gifts to individual officers. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund gave each captain a sword worth £50, and one worth £100 to Nathaniel Dance. Dance refused a baronetcy but was subsequently knighted.\n\n### Voyage #3 (1805–06)  \nCaptain John(s) James Williamson became captain of Ocean for this and her next two voyages. The change of captain required the issuing of a new letter of marque. This one was dated 17 December 1804.  \nOn her third voyage she left Portsmouth on 8 March 1805, bound for Madras and China. She reached Madeira on 26 March, and Madras on 14 July.  \nThis voyage also saw combat, but of a more minor sort. On 7 August Ocean was in company with the East Indiamen 2, Dorsetshire, and 2 in a convoy escorted by naval vessels under the command of Sir Thomas Troubridge. The British exchanged fire with three French warships that included 2 and Marengo, which did not press the attack.  \nBy 27 August Ocean was at Penang, and then on 14 September she was at Malacca. She reached Whampoa on 22 December. On the return leg Ocean was \"off Chumpee\" (Chuenpee) in the Bocca Tigris, the estuary of the Pearl River, on 26 February 1806. She reached St Helena on 2 July, and arrived at the Downs on 3 September.  \n### Voyage #4 (1808–09)  \nOn Her fourth voyage, Ocean left Portsmouth on 5 March 1808, sailing for China. She reached the Cape of Good Hope on 31 May. From there she sailed to Madras, which she reached on 3 August. From there she sailed to Penang (22 August) and Malacca (3 September), before reaching Whampoa on 2 October. On the return leg she crossed the Second Bar on 2 February 1809. She reached St Helena on 7 July, and The Downs on 8 September.  \n### Voyage #5 (1810-loss)  \nOcean was again under the command of Captain Williamson when she departed in January 1810 for St. Helena, Bencoolen, and China. Ocean apparently foundered off Pulo Sapate in 1811. Because the ship foundered, there is little further information.  \nThe EIC valued the cargo lost on her at £21,202. She appears on a list of vessels that are believed to have disappeared in typhoons in the India or China Seas.\n\nQuestion: Which ship is mentioned in the context of both images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Addiction to power in The Lord of the Rings  \nThe theme of addiction to power in The Lord of the Rings is central, as the Ring, made by the Dark Lord Sauron to enable him to take over the whole of Middle-earth, progressively corrupts the mind of its owner to use the Ring for evil.  \nThe corrupting power of the Ring has been compared to the Ring of Gyges in Plato's Republic, which gave the power of invisibility and so tempted its owner, but there is no evidence that Tolkien modelled The Lord of the Rings on that story. Scholars such as Tom Shippey consider the theme to be modern, since in earlier times, power was considered to reveal character, not to alter it, recalling the English politician Lord Acton's 1887 statement that \"power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\".  \nThe corrupting effect of power in the book is not limited to the Ring. Sauron was already corrupted when he chose to put much of his power into the Ring to gain further control of Middle-earth. Some other characters are of an earlier time, and are unaffected by the Ring; the giant spider Shelob is unquestionably evil but uninterested in the Ring. The Wizard Saruman turns to evil and is wholly corrupted, lured by pride and power, but never gets the Ring.  \nTolkien uses the Ring to illuminate the moral choices made by each character. Sméagol kills his friend Déagol to gain the Ring, and is corrupted by it, becoming wholly miserable as the creature Gollum. The virtuous warrior Boromir is seduced by the idea of using the Ring for good, and dies as a result. The Elf-lady Galadriel is greatly tempted, but rejects all use of the Ring. The Hobbit Frodo Baggins contends bravely with the Ring but is taken over by it, whereas his companion Samwise Gamgee is saved by his love for Frodo, and his simple good sense.  \n## The Ring and power  \n### In the narrative  \n<image>Artist's representation of the Ring\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy work The Lord of the Rings, the One Ring was forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom during the Second Age to gain dominion over peoples of Middle-earth. He intended it to control those who wore any of the other Rings of Power. Since they were powerful, he had to put much of his own power as a Maia, a supernatural being, into the Ring to achieve this.  \nWhen the Stoorish Hobbit Sméagol saw the Ring that his friend Déagol had found in the River Anduin, he killed Déagol to get it, and used the Ring's power of invisibility:  \nThe wizard Gandalf explains that Gollum was wholly corrupted by and addicted to the Ring:\n\n### The Ring's effects  \nA major theme is the corrupting influence of the Ring through the power it offers, especially to those already powerful. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes Gandalf's statements about the power and influence of the One Ring in \"The Shadow of the Past\", and the corrupting influence it has on its bearers. Gandalf rejects the Ring for this reason when Frodo offers it to him; this view of the Ring is reinforced as Elrond, Galadriel, Aragorn, and Faramir in their turn also reject it, fearing that it would overpower them as well. Inversely, the hobbits' good-naturedness and lack of ambition makes them less susceptible to the Ring's promises of power, as in Frodo and Samwise Gamgee, who are able to handle the Ring for extended periods of time. Hobbits are not totally immune to the Ring's effects, however, as shown by the changes it works in Frodo, Bilbo and Gollum. On the other hand, Boromir becomes obsessed with the Ring, but never possesses it, while Sméagol kills his kin Déagol, the first Ring bearer after Isildur, to obtain it.  \nGollum and Saruman differ from the other characters in submitting willingly to an evil power; the effect, according to the scholar Patricia Spacks, is of gradual destruction, even when the character starts out mainly virtuous. Saruman's case shows, she writes, that \"pride and the lust for power\", as he strives to get the Ring and to be powerful like Sauron, are enough to destroy him even though he never gets the Ring. When Gandalf comes to the ruins of Isengard to meet Saruman, and offers him freedom in place of slavery to Sauron, Saruman is too thoroughly corrupted to be able to choose any longer. As for Gollum, he is \"a far more pitiable creature\" as the Ring has taken him from a basically amoral position to one of evil. When Frodo suggests Gollum is not totally evil, Faramir replies \"Not wholly, perhaps, but malice eats it like a canker, and the evil is growing\".  \n### Tolkien vs Plato  \nThe theme of a corrupting ring dates back to Plato's Republic, where the Ring of Gyges gave invisibility and thus the ability to get away with crime.2009  \nThe philosopher Eric Katz, however writes that \"Plato argues that such moral corruption will occur, but Tolkien shows us this corruption through the thoughts and actions of his characters\"; Plato tries to counter the \"cynical conclusion\" that moral life is chosen by the weak; Glaucon thinks that people are only \"good\" because they suppose they will be caught if they are not. Plato argues that immoral life is no good as it corrupts one's soul. So, Katz states, according to Plato a moral person has peace and happiness, and would not use a Ring of Power. Katz writes that Tolkien's story \"demonstrates various responses to the question posed by Plato: would a just person be corrupted by the possibility of almost unlimited power?\" The question is answered in different ways: Gollum is weak, corrupted, and finally destroyed; Boromir begins virtuous but like Plato's Gyges is corrupted \"by the temptation of power\" from the Ring, even if he wants to use it for good, but redeems himself by defending the hobbits to his own death; the \"strong and virtuous\" Galadriel, who sees clearly what she would become if she accepted the ring, and rejects it; the immortal Tom Bombadil, exempt from the Ring's corrupting power and from its gift of invisibility; Sam who in a moment of need faithfully uses the ring, but is not seduced by its vision of \"Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age\"; and finally Frodo who is gradually corrupted, but is saved by his earlier mercy to Gollum, and Gollum's desperation for the Ring. Katz concludes that Tolkien's answer to Plato's \"Why be moral?\" is \"to be yourself\".  \n## Addiction  \n### \"Power corrupts\"  \n<image>Lord Acton famously stated \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\", an idea embodied in the addictive power of the One Ring.\nThe corrupting effect of power is, according to Shippey, a modern theme, since in earlier times, power was considered to \"reveal character\", not alter it. Shippey quotes Lord Acton's 1887 statement:  \nShippey points out authors contemporary with Tolkien who dealt in the theme of the corrupting influence of power: George Orwell with Animal Farm (1945), William Golding with Lord of the Flies (1954), and T. H. White with The Once and Future King (1958). In his view, this was largely a modern idea; he writes that the nearest medieval equivalent is the Old English proverb \"man deþ swa he byþ þonne he mot swa he wile\": \"A man does as he is when he can do what he wants\", i.e. power reveals existing character, rather than changing it for the worse. The Lord of the Rings is largely medieval in its setting, but its attitude to the corrupting effect of power is an anachronism, something wholly modern. He sees a modern echo, too, in Boromir's response to the Ring, with \"all the signals which the twentieth century has learned to distrust\", including fascination with power even if it is the Enemy's; his speech  praising \"the fearless\" and then \"the ruthless\" as the way to victory; the portrayal of himself as a leader with \"power of Command\"; and eventually \"the naked appeal to force\".  \nThe Tolkien scholars Agnes Perkins and Helen Hill, writing in A Tolkien Compass, analyse the corrupting effect of power. They pay particular attention to the Ring, but point out that the issue is wider than that, as some characters were corrupted long before the Rings were forged. They view Tolkien's scheme as having five groups of three characters, each affected differently by power.\n\n### A single explanation  \nThe literary critic Colin Manlove criticises Tolkien's attitude towards power as inconsistent, with exceptions to the supposedly overwhelming influence of the Ring. The Ring can be handed over relatively easily (Sam and Bilbo), and removing the Ring by force (Gollum to Frodo) does not, despite Gandalf's assertion at the beginning of the story, break Frodo's mind. The Ring also appears to have little effect on characters such as Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Shippey notes that, despite Manlove, Tolkien is fair in showing a regular pattern of \"creeping corruption\": Bilbo becomes angry when Gandalf tries to coax him to give up the Ring, and is seen as \"a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands\" when he asks Frodo to let him look at the Ring just one more time; Isildur uses Gollum-like words with \"It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain\"; there is Gollum's corrupted state throughout the story; and there are the ominous signals from Boromir. Shippey replies to Manlove's doubt with \"one word\": addictive. He writes that this sums up Gandalf's whole argument, as in the early stages, as with Bilbo and Sam, the addiction can be shaken off easily enough, while for those who are not yet addicted, as with Aragorn and indeed others like Galadriel and Faramir, its pull is like any other temptation. What Gandalf could not do to Frodo, Shippey writes, is make him want to hand the Ring over. And for the owner of the Ring, the destructive aspect is the urge to use it, no matter how good the intentions of the owner might be at the start. Katz writes that \"it is clear that Tolkien is demonstrating to us the progressive forces of corruption of the possession and use of the One Ring\"; usage may begin innocently or accidentally, but \"its seductive power\" gradually wears down any resistance.  \nOther critics, too, have described the Ring as addictive, with each use progressively increasing the hold the Ring has over its bearer. Bilbo, while possessing the Ring for some time, is able to give it away willingly, though with considerable difficulty. Later, when he encounters the Ring in Rivendell, he experiences a powerful longing to hold it again. Frodo also shows features of addiction, ultimately becoming unable to relinquish the Ring of his own accord.  \nIn Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, the effects of the Ring on Bilbo and Frodo are obsessions that have been compared with drug addiction; the actor Andy Serkis, who played Gollum, cited drug addiction as an inspiration for his performance. Critical theory scholar Douglas Kellner, examining the question of whether the work is an allegory despite Tolkien's statement to the contrary, writes that Gollum serves as \"a cautionary warning as to what obsession with the Ring and addiction to power can do to someone. In deprivation, he craves his 'precious' talisman of power, although he knows its destructive force. The film presents a parable of addiction, as Gollum is torn apart by his need for the destructive substance\".  \n### Revealing each character's morality  \nKatz argues that Tolkien uses the device of the Ring and its addictive power to reveal each character's morality in turn. The extreme case is Sméagol, whose addiction to the Ring becomes more pronounced as, over 500 years, he is wholly overcome by its power. He is transformed into the monstrous creature Gollum, showing traits ranging from withdrawal and isolation to suspicion and anger towards others; his obsession with the Ring leads to his demise. Eventually he is \"utterly destroyed\" by the pull of the Ring.  \n### Overcoming the addiction  \nThe Tolkien scholar Patrick Curry writes that Tolkien's narrative is not limited to \"a single, all-consuming crisis: the War of the Ring dominates, but is not absolutely everything\", and furthermore \"Nor is the end of the Ring a purely voluntary, willed and idealistic renunciation\": the addiction is not broken by a single choice. Instead, he argues, that is brought about by \"countless acts of courage, kindness and help, both small and great, from unknown people and forces, in unforeseen circumstances, that together provide an opportunity to do the right thing.\" That in turn is accompanied by \"a commitment to the simple good things of life – food, water, green and growing things\", making \"an appreciation of life itself, at once natural and spiritual\" the value that succeeds. Curry sees this as offering hope in the real world, and the principal message of Tolkien's writings.  \nCurry cites the moment when Sam is saved from the Ring's temptation:  \nSaruman, a Wizard not a warrior, expresses the temptation to Gandalf, in the hope of persuading him, as \"Knowledge, Rule, Order\". The Episcopal priest and Tolkien scholar Fleming Rutledge writes that Saruman's triad is capitalised \"as though they were Powers. They sound oppressive, like Nazi slogans... in the German fashion\". She notes the half-elf Elrond's description of the lust for power: \"strength, domination, and hoarded wealth\", which Elrond contrasts with another triad, \"understanding, making, and healing\". She explains that these \"softer, gentler\" things are \"more powerful than any conventional weapons\".\n\nQuestion: Which statement best reflects the theme common to both the representation of the One Ring and the idea expressed by Lord Acton?\nChoice list: \nA.

Number 7 is a specimen of Calommata transvaalica, a spider from the Blouberg\n\n<image>NASA picture of the Blouberg (dark shape, middle right) and the pale Makgabeng Plateau directly to the south of it\nThe Blouberg (formerly \"Blaauwberg\"), meaning \"Blue Mountain\" in Dutch, is a range of mountains in the Limpopo Province, at the far north of South Africa. It is located in Blouberg Local Municipality, Capricorn District. The mountain is entrenched in the history of the local Northern Sotho people, and they have different names for its various parts.  \nThe Blouberg forms part of the 'Vhembe Biosphere Reserve', named a biosphere reserve by UNESCO since 2009. This reserve also includes the neighboring Makgabeng Plateau, the Soutpansberg, the northern part of the Kruger National Park, the Makuleke Wetlands and the Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape. The eastern and part of the central Blouberg prominences are enclosed and protected as part of the Blouberg Nature Reserve. A 4x4 track traverses Rapanyan's Neck, the defile that separates these easterly subranges.\n\n## Setting  \nThis rocky mountain range rises over a plateau averaging 900 m to the west of the western end of the Soutpansberg range. The Blouberg is topped by massive rocky outcrops resembling castles or fortifications with sheer walls. Its highest point reaches 2,040 m above sea level and is also the highest point of the entire Soutpansberg/Blouberg system.  \nThe Brak River (also known as Hout River), a tributary of the Sand River, flows diagonally along the southeastern edge of the Blouberg, separating it from the Soutpansberg further east. Although these two  ranges are clearly destinguishable from a geographical point of view, geologically the Blouberg forms part of the Soutpansberg.  \n## Human population  \nAbout 117 settlements in its foothills are home to some 161,000 inhabitants, belonging to the Bahananwa nation. Senwabarwana, the economic centre of these villages, is visited by many to do their shopping. During the 19th century they were incorporated into the South African Republic, and the homeland system was introduced during the Apartheid era of the 20th century. Basic infrastructure and developmental needs were neglected, and in the 21st century it remains one of Limpopo's most underdeveloped regions. Many villages experience high unemployment rates, severe poverty or low levels of income despite the area's natural resources. Their isolation is mitigated by their sense of community and connectivity to each other.  \n## Ecology  \nThe vegetation of the Blouberg ranges from sub-tropical veld or savanna at the base, to a type of Afro-montane vegetation related to the Cape Fynbos near the summits. The rocky cliffs are a haven for birds of prey such as the Cape vultures.  \nThe Blouberg, like its larger neighbor further east, the Soutpansberg, is known for a high level of endemism of its invertebrate fauna, such as the Swanepoel's widow butterfly that is found on the southern slopes of the range. The Waterberg flat lizard and a subspecies of the common flat lizard are found in this range.  \n## Rock climbing  \nThe Blouberg is one of the most spectacular rock climbing areas in South Africa. As a rock climbing destination it is famous for its sheer 350 m \"Moonshadow\" wall. Most of the climbing spots are on private land but climbers can make arrangements to access them through the Alldays Mountain Club in nearby Alldays, Limpopo.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts the specimen of Calommata transvaalica, a spider from the Blouberg?\nChoice list: \nA.

He was born in Nancy and died in Paris.\n\n## Life  \nThe Adam family home in Nancy  \nAdam was the youngest of the three sons of the sculptor Jacob Sigisbert Adam of Nancy. His brothers Lambert-Sigisbert Adam and François Gaspard Adam were also sculptors.  \nIn 1757, Adam married Christine Lenoir, the daughter of a goldsmith in Nancy. They had two sons, the painter Jean Charles Nicolas Adam and the sculptor Gaspard Louis Adam.  \nNicolas Adam was blind when he died in 1778 in Paris.  \n## Career  \nAdam studied first with his father, then with his elder brother Lambert, at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture). He failed to obtain the prix de Rome, but did receive funding to travel to Italy. Along the way, he stopped to work on the ornamental façade of the Château de la Mosson at Juvignac, near Montpellier, spending 18 months on the project. He finally arrived in Rome in 1726. His brother introduced him to the cardinal Melchior de Polignac, for whom he restored a number of ancient marbles.  \nAdam returned to Paris in 1734, working in his elder brother's atelier. Soon he began to receive a number of commissions. With his brother, he worked on Le Triomphe de Neptune et d'Amphitrite (\"The Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite,\" completed 1740), the large sculpture group in lead for the Neptune fountain at the Palace of Versailles.  \nDuring the same period, he worked for the Rohan family at the Hôtel de Soubise, sculpting bas-reliefs for Amours des Dieux (\"The Gods' Love Affairs\", 1736) in the state chamber of the Princess. The Bâtiments du Roi commissioned him for work at the Courts of Accounts in Paris, at the Basilica of St. Denis, and on the royal chapel at Versailles. At the abbey he created a bas-relief Saint Maur Seeking the Aid of the Lord for the Healing of a Child. The fathers at the Oratory of Paris entrusted him with the decoration of the church portal.  \nPrometheus Bound (1762), Adam's reception piece for the Academy  \nHis reception piece for the Academy in 1762 was Prometheus Bound (French Prométhée enchaîné) considered one of the masterpieces of 18th-century sculpture. His most notable work, however, is the funeral monument of the queen Catherine Opalińska, wife of Stanislas Leszczyński, at the Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours church in Nancy. It depicts the deceased kneeling, with her hands joined in an attitude of prayer. An angel takes her by the hand to guide her to Heaven. The base is of black marble. Executed with great elegance, the group is regarded as one of the most remarkable and genuinely moving funeral monuments of the 18th century.  \nNicolas Adam, like his brother Lambert, was influenced by the Italian Baroque. He ranks with him as one of the most refined and subtle sculptors of his time. He was a major influence on his nephew, the sculptor Clodion.  \n## Selected works  \n<image>Religion Instructing an Indian (1745), expressing the colonialist attitudes of 18th-century Europe\n* Nymph  (c. 1723), bas-relief in the pediment of the great hall, and berry ornamentation on the ground floor of the Château de la Mosson, Juvignac  \n* The Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite (1735 - 1740), lead sculpture for the fountain at Versailles, in collaboration with his brother Lambert Sigisbert Adam  \n* Les Amours des Dieux (\"Love Affairs of the Gods,\" 1736), stucco relief, Hôtel de Soubise, Paris, the chamber of the Princess  image  \n* L'Automne (\"Autumn,\" 1745), marble vase, originally created for the grounds at the Château de Choisy, now in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art  \n* Religion Instructing an Indian (1745), marble statue group, church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis, Paris  \n* The Martyrdom of Saint Victoria (1747), bronze relief, bronze, royal chapel at Versailles  \n* Funeral monument of the queen Catherine Opalińska (1749), marble and bronze, Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours at Nancy, France  \n* A series of narrative reliefs on Apollo: Apollo et Daphne, Latona and the Farmers, Apollo and the Sibyl, Apollo and Coronis (c. 1753), bas-reliefs for the Hôtel de la Bouëxière in Paris, Château de Bagatelle et Musée Carnavalet  \n* Angelica and Medoro from Orlando Furioso, a marble statue group along with Apollo and Diana, originally created for the Hôtel de Choiseul in Paris, now in the Museum of Amiens  \n* Prometheus Bound (1762), a marble sculpture group at the Louvre  \n* Iris Putting on Her Wings (1775–76), a marble statue finished by his nephew Clodion, Versailles\n\n\nQuestion: Which work was created by Nicolas-Sébastien Adam, also known as \"Adam the Younger\"?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Micro-atmosphere method  \n<image>Streak plates of several bacterial species on nutrient agar plates\nThe micro-atmosphere method is an antimicrobial testing method involving the use of potentially bacteriostatic or fungicidal compounds which are obtained from the volatile oils of plants, such as citronella grass. This method involves the use of essential oils, a growth medium, a selection of bacterial or cultures and an incubator.\n\n## Method  \nIn this microbiological procedure, theoretically, the antibacterial or anti-fungal activity of the volatile oils from a chosen plant may be tested against a selection of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria or a species of fungus. The growth of the bacteria or fungi are then monitored on a timely basis to measure the bacteriostatic or anti-fungal activity of the volatile oils. In some cases, a complete inhibition of growth for the bacteria tested can be observed.  \n## Dilution of essential oils  \nBefore it can be tested, the essential oils are first diluted to produce solutions of varying concentrations. In this way, the minimum inhibitory concentration can be calculated to obtain the most cost-effective antimicrobial agent.  \n## Antibacterial activity  \nUntil recently, the antibacterial activity of essential oils has been primarily evaluated through direct contact methods between the pathogen and the antimicrobial agent through diffusion and dilution methods, however the role of essential oils in the vapour phase as antimicrobial agents is gaining increasing significance.  \nThis method was developed on the premise that essential oil vapours exert critical biological activity. These methods offer rapid screening protocols for the antimicrobial assessment of plant essential oils. It has been suggested that essential oils in the vapour phase possess the greatest degree of antimicrobial activity since the active constituents are highly volatile in nature and thus, the vapour is therefore the contributing attribute for its biological activity. Each individual constituent has differing volatility, therefore when the mixtures are introduced into a free, non-saturated state in a closed micro-environment; the volatile constituents begin to disperse at differing rates in the vapour phase within the headspace according to their degree of volatility until they reach equilibrium.  \nPreliminary research involving the essential oils of citronella yielded promising results when tested against a selection of Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. The use of such extracts can be explored especially in the development of cost-effective treatments of respiratory illness, specifically of those caused by bacterial or fungal infection. Preliminary tests exhibit complete inhibition of the growth of certain bacterial strains.  \n## Anti-fungal activity  \n<image>Kirby–Bauer testing: White wafers containing antibiotics shown on plate of bacteria. Circles of poor bacterial growth surround some wafers, indicating susceptibility to the antibiotic\nIn a separate research, the micro-atmosphere method was used to investigate the anti-fungal efficacy of the essential oils from the cinnamon, a plant belonging to the genus Cinnamomum.  \nThe procedure was employed to ensure that the active films, the material containing the active compound, does not come into direct contact to the tested fungal suspension.  \nThe micro-atmosphere method was performed, in order to evaluate the indirect effects of active films against P. digitatum. Addition of 0.5% cinnamon essential oil, led to 12% inhibition of fungal growth. Higher anti-fungal effects were obtained by adding higher amounts of the essential oil. An inhibition of fungal growth between 28% and 50% were observed for the films incorporated with 1.5% and 3% essential oil, respectively.  \nIn this particular research, the potential anti-fungal agent was subjected to both disk diffusion test and the micro-atmosphere method for comparison and to get an idea of how the active compound may be utilized. The active compound exhibited higher anti-fungal effects in the disc diffusion test compared to the micro-atmosphere assays. This could be attributed to the fact that in the disc diffusion test, both direct contact and migration of active compounds from the film to the outside induced the observed antimicrobial effects. On the other hand, only the migration of the volatile compounds to the headspace, may cause the anti-fungal effect in the micro-atmosphere method.\n\n\nQuestion: Which method is depicted in Image 2 for testing the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics?\nChoice list: \nA.

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, January 28, 2023, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas as part of the Alamodome's 30th-anniversary celebration. It was the fourth Royal Rumble event to be held in San Antonio after the 1997, 2007, and 2017 events and the third to take place at the Alamodome, following 1997 and 2017. It was also WWE's first event to be livestreamed on Binge in Australia as the WWE Network service in Australia merged with Binge, a streaming service owned by WWE's Australian rightsholder Foxtel.  \nTraditionally, the Royal Rumble match winner receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2023 event, only the women's match winner received a choice of which world championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 39. Due to Raw's WWE Championship and SmackDown's Universal Championship being held and defended together as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, the men's winner received a match for the tandem titles, while the women had their choice between the Raw or SmackDown Women's Championship. While the Royal Rumble match is typically the main event of the card, this was the seventh Royal Rumble in which the match was not the main event, after 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2006, and 2013. It was also the first Royal Rumble where the eponymous match opened the event.  \nFive matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Kevin Owens to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. For the Royal Rumble matches, Raw's Rhea Ripley won the women's match, becoming the first woman to win the match from the number one spot as well as setting the record for longest time spent in the women's Rumble at 1:01:08, while Raw's Cody Rhodes won the men's in the opening match by last eliminating #1 entrant Gunther, who also set the record for longest time spent in a men's 30-man Rumble at 1:11:40 and the second man to draw #1 and emerge as runner-up. In another prominent match, Bray Wyatt, in his first televised match since WrestleMania 37 in April 2021, defeated LA Knight in a Pitch Black match in a cross-promotion with Mountain Dew. This would also be Wyatt's final televised match as he contracted COVID-19 the following month, which exacerbated a heart issue and he died of a heart attack on August 24, 2023. The event also saw the return of color commentator Pat McAfee, who joined Michael Cole and Corey Graves on commentary, Cody Rhodes, Edge, Beth Phoenix, Asuka, Chelsea Green, Nia Jax, and Logan Paul, who made his first Royal Rumble appearance. Former WWE wrestler Michelle McCool also made an appearance in the women's Royal Rumble match, while WWE Hall of Famer and NXT commentator Booker T appeared in the men's.  \n## Production  \n### Background  \n<image>The event was held at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the \"Big Five\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. Announced on September 7, 2022, the 36th Royal Rumble was scheduled to be held on Saturday, January 28, 2023, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas as part of the Alamodome's 30th-anniversary celebration. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. In addition to airing on pay-per-view worldwide, it was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in international markets. It was also WWE's first event to air on Binge in Australia after the Australian version of the WWE Network merged under Foxtel's channel Binge on January 23. Tickets went on sale on September 30 with premium hospitality packages also available. The official theme song of the event was \"Sold Out\" by country music singer Hardy, who performed the song live at the Royal Rumble.  \nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2023, just the women's match winner received a choice of which world championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 39. Due to Raw's WWE Championship and SmackDown's Universal Championship being held and defended together as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, the men's winner received a match for the tandem titles, while the women had their choice between the Raw Women's Championship or SmackDown Women's Championship.\n\n### Storylines  \nThe event included five matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.  \nOn December 26, 2022, WWE's YouTube channel promoted a \"Pitch Black match\" to be held at the Royal Rumble in a cross-promotion with Mountain Dew for the return of the \"Pitch Black\" flavor. On the December 30 episode of SmackDown, following a couple of months of alleged attacks by Bray Wyatt on LA Knight, with Wyatt claiming it was someone named Uncle Howdy, Knight challenged Wyatt to a match at the Royal Rumble, and Wyatt accepted. Howdy then appeared and attacked Wyatt. It was later confirmed that this would be the Pitch Black match. This would also notably be Wyatt's first televised match since WrestleMania 37 in April 2021. During an appearance on the WWE After The Bell podcast on January 4, 2023, Knight said the only thing he knew about the match was that it would essentially be a street fight \"kind of in the dark\". On the January 6 episode of SmackDown, commentator Michael Cole further stated that the match would be \"anything goes\" and could only be won via pinfall or submission, but nothing else was known.  \nAt Survivor Series WarGames, Kevin Owens, who had past issues with Roman Reigns, was one of the members of the opposing team in a WarGames match against Reigns' team, The Bloodline. The two previously feuded over the Universal Championship only for Owens to constantly lose due to interference from members of The Bloodline, including their manager Paul Heyman—Owens and Reigns' last title match was at the 2021 Royal Rumble. The Bloodline was victorious at Survivor Series thanks to Sami Zayn—Owens' former best friend—betraying Owens to show his loyalty to The Bloodline. Despite the loss, Owens continued to target The Bloodline over the next few weeks and Owens teamed with a returning John Cena to defeat Reigns and Zayn on the December 30, 2022, episode of SmackDown, where Owens pinned Zayn. The following week, Owens challenged Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble, which was made official.  \nOn the December 12, 2022, episode of Raw, Alexa Bliss defeated Bayley to become the number one contender for the Raw Women's Championship. After the match, champion Bianca Belair congratulated Bliss and as the two hugged, Bray Wyatt's logo appeared on the TitanTron (due to Bliss' past association with Wyatt) and Bliss positioned Belair for a Sister Abigail but came back to her senses before performing the move. The following week, Belair and Bliss were interviewed backstage, where at the end of the segment, Wyatt's logo again appeared on the screen and Bliss hit Belair over the head with a vase of flowers. During her championship match against Belair on January 2, 2023, episode, Bliss was distracted by people wearing Uncle Howdy masks, and after Wyatt's logo appeared on the TitanTron, Bliss attacked the referee, forcing a disqualification and allowing Belair to retain. After the match, Bliss attacked Belair, performing two DDTs on the steel stairs. On the January 16 episode, Belair challenged Bliss to a championship rematch at the Royal Rumble, and Bliss accepted. The two then brawled with Bliss getting the upper hand after an appearance by Howdy.  \nOn the January 16, 2023, episode of Raw, after weeks of footage showing Cody Rhodes' journey to recovery from a torn pec he suffered before Hell in a Cell in June 2022, Rhodes announced that he would be returning from his injury as an entrant in the men's Royal Rumble match.  \n## Event  \n### Preliminary matches  \nThe pay-per-view opened with the men's Royal Rumble match for a men's world championship match at WrestleMania 39: notably, this was the first time the eponymous match began the event. Gunther and Sheamus began the match. The Miz entered at #3 and tried distracting Sheamus to allow Gunther to eliminate him, however, Sheamus fought off Gunther and Miz. Sheamus chased Miz around the ring, however, Gunther subdued Miz. With the assistance of Johnny Gargano (#5), Sheamus performed 10 Beats of the Bodhran on Miz.

Lesnar then tossed a referee over the ring barricade before leaving the ring. As Corbin did not officially enter the match due to getting attacked by Lesnar earlier, #15 entrant Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins threw Corbin into the ring, performed a superkick on Corbin and eliminated him. #16 entrant Otis dominated everyone else. Rey Mysterio was supposed to enter at #17, however, he did not come out due to a presumed attack by his son, Dominik Mysterio, who entered at #18 while wearing Rey's mask. During Dominik's entrance, Sheamus eliminated Otis. Instead of entering the ring, Dominik showboated at ringside while Sheamus tried to taunt him. Dominik eventually entered the match and tried to eliminate Sheamus, however, Sheamus countered. Elias entered at 19th, wielding a guitar, and smashed it over Gunther's back.

Omos entered #26 and dominated the other competitors. Braun Strowman entered at #27 and a brawl ensued between Strowman and Omos, after which, Strowman eliminated Omos. Both McIntyre and Sheamus then performed the 10 Beats of the Bodhran on Strowman, however, Gunther then eliminated both McIntyre and Sheamus. Logan Paul, in his first appearance since Crown Jewel in November 2022, entered at #29, however, he was quickly outnumbered by the other competitors. The last entrant, Cody Rhodes, then entered the match. Rhodes countered Dominik's Three Amigos and performed Cross Rhodes on Dominik before eliminating him from the match. Gunther performed the Last Symphony on Strowman. Ricochet (#28) and Paul leapt off the top rope and collided with each other.

Shortly afterwards, Gunther broke Rey Mysterio's record for the longest time spent in a traditional Royal Rumble match. Rollins performed a Stomp on Theory followed by Rhodes eliminating Theory. The final four were Rhodes, Gunther, Rollins, and Paul. Rhodes and Rollins both performed Pedigrees on Gunther. After Paul eliminated Rollins, Rhodes performed Cross Rhodes on Paul and eliminated him. In the closing moments, after a long battle between Gunther and Rhodes, Rhodes performed Cross Rhodes on Gunther and performed a clothesline on Gunther out of the ring to win the match and earn himself an Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match at WrestleMania 39. Rhodes became the fifth person to win the match from the #30 position. Additionally, Gunther set a new record for longest time spent in a men's Royal Rumble match at 1:11:40 and the second #1 entrant after \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin in 1999 to emerge as runner-up.  \nNext, LA Knight faced Bray Wyatt in the Mountain Dew Pitch Black match. This was an anything goes match done under blacklighting. The blacklighting illuminated body and face paint on Wyatt which presented Wyatt with a demon-like appearance, including red eyes. During the match, Knight leapt off the barricade and performed a splash on Wyatt through the announce table. Wyatt then threw a toolbox into the ring, however, Knight attacked Wyatt. In the end, Knight attacked Wyatt with a kendo stick from the top turnbuckle and then attempted to attack Wyatt again, however, Wyatt performed Sister Abigail on Knight to win the match. After the match, Wyatt put on a demon-esque mask and taunted Knight. Knight escaped and attacked Wyatt with a kendo stick who stalked Knight into the crowd. Wyatt performed the Mandible Claw on Knight atop a raised platform—reminiscent of Wyatt's former Fiend gimmick. Uncle Howdy then appeared and performed an elbow drop off a raised platform onto Knight, which set off a pyro explosion, and the Firefly Fun House characters were seen watching from the raised platform. This was Wyatt's last televised match, as he passed away on August 24 due to a heart attack, caused by a life-threatening illness.  \nAfter that, Bianca Belair defended the Raw Women's Championship against Alexa Bliss. In the end, as Bliss attempted Sister Abigail on Belair, Belair countered and performed a Kiss of Death on Bliss to retain the title. After the match, a video package aired with old clips of Bliss from when she was associated with Bray Wyatt, and Uncle Howdy then asked Bliss if she was truly in control of herself.  \nThe penultimate match was the women's Royal Rumble match for a women's championship match at WrestleMania 39. Rhea Ripley (#1) and Liv Morgan (#2) began the match. Emma, in her first Royal Rumble match, entered at #4 and began to target Ripley. Dana Brooke (#3), Emma, and Morgan tried to eliminate Ripley, however, Ripley fought them off. Bayley then entered the match as entrant #6, followed by Hit Row's B-Fab, who entered at #7. B-Fab would then be quickly eliminated by Ripley. NXT Women's Champion Roxanne Perez was a surprise entrant at #8 and dominated the other competitors. Bayley's Damage CTRL teammates, Dakota Kai (#9) and Iyo Sky (#10), entered the match and all three members of Damage CTRL teamed up to eliminate Brooke. Bayley eliminated Emma followed by Damage CTRL eliminating Perez. A returning Natalya entered at #11, and after a brief partnership with her former tag team partner, Shayna Baszler (#5), Natalya turned on Baszler and both started attacking each other. As Natalya and Baszler tried to eliminate each other, Bayley, Kai, and Sky eventually eliminated both. NXT's Zoey Stark entered at #13. Sky shoved Candice LeRae (#12) off a turnbuckle to eliminate her. Becky Lynch entered at #15 and began to target Damage CTRL, however, Bayley threw Lynch through the second rope and Kai and Sky brawled with Lynch at ringside, eventually sending her over the announce table. Tegan Nox entered at #16 and dominated Damage CTRL who reentered the ring as they were not eliminated after brawling with Lynch earlier. Asuka entered at #17 and began to target Bayley. Asuka then eliminated Nox. Tamina entered at #19 and had a stare down with Piper Niven (previously known as Doudrop, and reverting to the name she used in NXT UK), who entered at #18. After Tamina took out Niven, Bayley, Kai and Sky dominated Tamina, however, Lynch returned to the match and targeted Bayley, Kai and Sky. A returning Chelsea Green entered at #20 only for Ripley to eliminate her in five seconds, setting the record for shortest time spent in a women's Royal Rumble. After Lynch eliminated Kai and Sky, Bayley eliminated Lynch, however, Bayley was eliminated by Morgan. A second brawl ensued between Lynch and Damage CTRL, which spilled into the crowd. Zelina Vega entered at #21, donning cosplay in a cross-promotion with Street Fighter and fought with Xia Li (#14) on the ring apron, eventually eliminating Li. Raquel Rodriguez entered at #22 and dominated the other competitors. Lacey Evans entered at #24, followed by Michelle McCool entering at #25, who was seated in the front row. After McCool eliminated Tamina, NXT's Indi Hartwell entered at #26, making a surprise appearance. Sonya Deville entered at #27, after which, Deville eliminated Stark. Evans applied a Cobra Clutch on Vega before eliminating her. Shotzi, who recovered from a hand injury in December, entered at #28. As Hartwell attempted a springboard, Deville eliminated her. Nikki Cross entered at #29 and dominated the other competitors. Nia Jax, in her first WWE appearance since her release in November 2021, entered at #30. Ripley performed a Riptide on Jax, after which, all the other wrestlers ganged up on Jax and eliminated her. Rodriguez eliminated Evans and Asuka eliminated Deville. Ripley eliminated McCool, and Yim performed Eat Defeat on Shotzi to eliminate her, after which, Ripley threw Yim at Shotzi to eliminate her. After a battle between Rodriguez and Niven, Rodriguez eliminated Niven. As Rodriguez attempted a Texana Bomb on Ripley, Ripley pulled her over the top rope and eliminated her. The final four were Ripley, Morgan, Cross, and Asuka. Morgan quickly eliminated Cross, and in the closing moments, Asuka spat mist on Morgan, which gave Ripley the chance to eliminate Asuka. Morgan performed a Codebreaker on Ripley, who prevented elimination. Ripley then headscissored Morgan to the floor to win the match and earn herself a women's championship match at WrestleMania 39. This win made Ripley the first woman to win the women's Royal Rumble match from the number one position (and the fourth person overall to do so), and saw her spend the longest time in a women's Rumble match at 1:01:08, beating Bianca Belair's previous record of 57 minutes and 10 seconds. Additionally, this was only the fourth time that the first and second entrants lasted the entire match and finished as the final two (last occurring in 1995, 1999, and 2021).  \nFollowing this, country music singer Hardy performed his song \"Sold Out\".  \n### Main event  \nIn the main event, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman and Sami Zayn) defended the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Kevin Owens. During the match, Owens performed a Frog Splash on Reigns for a nearfall. Reigns performed a powerbomb on Owens for a nearfall. Reigns performed a Superman Punch on Owens for a nearfall. As Reigns attempted a spear on Owens, Owens sent Reigns into the ring post and Owens performed a Senton on Reigns for a nearfall. Reigns performed a Spear on Owens for a nearfall. As Reigns attempted another Spear, Owens countered with an attempted stunner, however, Reigns countered and shoved Owens into the referee, incapacitating him. Owens then performed a pop-up powerbomb on Reigns, however, the referee was unable to count the pin. Reigns then performed a low blow on Owens and then instructed Zayn to retrieve a chair. As Reigns was momentarily distracted by Zayn who hesitated in handing the chair to Reigns, Owens performed a Stunner on Reigns for a nearfall. As Owens went for another pop-up powerbomb, Reigns intercepted Owens with a Superman Punch and a second Spear for a nearfall. At ringside, Zayn distracted Owens imploring him to stay down. Reigns then took advantage and performed a Spear on Owens through the barricade. Reigns then slammed Owens' head against the steel steps twice. In the end, Owens slapped Reigns, who responded with a third Spear on Owens to retain the titles.  \n<image>The Bloodline exiting the event.\nAfter the match, the rest of The Bloodline (Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, and Solo Sikoa) came out. As Jey attempted to adorn Zayn with the tribal garland, Reigns intervened and the Bloodline then delivered a beatdown to Owens, with The Usos and Sikoa doing the damage while Zayn was watching. Heyman handed two pairs of handcuffs to Reigns and The Usos handcuffed both arms of Owens to the ropes. After The Usos viciously attacked Owens with superkicks, Reigns attempted to strike a fallen Owens with a chair, however, Zayn intervened and told Reigns that Owens had enough, and such a savage attack was beneath someone of Reigns' status. Reigns then handed the chair to Zayn, instructing him to strike Owens to prove his loyalty to The Bloodline. Zayn hesitated, and Reigns then began berating Zayn, pointing out how much Reigns and The Bloodline had done for Zayn in elevating his career. A conflicted Zayn then attacked Reigns with the chair, which prompted the entire Bloodline (except Jey, who had taken a liking to Zayn and was emotionally conflicted by what he just witnessed) to beat down Zayn. Jey left the ring and Zayn was removed from the Bloodline, turning Zayn face for the first time since 2017. Reigns, Jimmy, Sikoa, and Heyman headed up the entrance aisle while Owens and Zayn were laid out in the ring as the event came to an end.\n\n## Reception  \nThe 2023 Royal Rumble was a financial success for WWE. The company reported that it was the biggest gate in Royal Rumble history, garnering more than US$7.7 million, more than 50% than the previous record set by the 2017 event. It also had a 52% increase in viewership over the previous record set by the 2022 event. Additionally, the 2023 event broke all-time venue merchandise and sponsorship records, with merchandise sales up 135% over the record set in 2022, and sponsorship revenue was up nearly 200% over 2022. Sponsorships included Mountain Dew for the Pitch Black match and Applebee's for the countdown clock. The final segment featuring The Bloodline, particularly between Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn, generated over 20 million views across all of WWE's social media platforms. Dave Meltzer reported the Mountain Dew sponsorship was for 1 million dollars.  \nWWE reported an attendance of 51,338, though a report by Wrestlenomics said according to a public records request with the City of San Antonio (which operates the Alamodome), the company sold 44,569 tickets for the event, and that he number of tickets scanned and entered was 42,928.  \nDave Meltzer gave star ratings for each match of the night. The lowest rated match was Bray Wyatt vs. LA Knight, which received 0.75 stars, the Raw Women's Championship match received 1.5 stars, the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match and the women's Royal Rumble match both received 3.5 stars, and the men's Royal Rumble match received 4.25 stars, the highest rated match of the night.  \nBrent Brookhouse of CBS Sports gave praise to the main event, giving it a grade of A+, stating that \"there was so much to dig into in that match\". He also stated that the best moment of the aftermath of the match was Jey Uso's walkout, which \"established the pecking order of The Bloodline\", and also called it \"a full circle moment dating back to the group's origins and Jey Uso's feud with Reigns in 2020\". Wade Keller of Pro Wrestling Torch gave the match 4 stars out of 5, and that the angle was \"phenomenal\" with a \"perfect crowd response\". Brandon LeClair, also from Pro Wrestling Torch, praised Sami Zayn's betrayal of The Bloodline. He said that it was \"unbelievable\" while also stating that it \"certainly leads to that old cliche\". LeClair said that \"the crowd's reaction to Sami delivering the chair shot to Reigns provides any necessary proof that this has been wildly successful\", and \"the crowd was nearly as enthralled by an emotional Jey Uso walking out on his family, seemingly siding with Zayn\". Chris Mueller of Bleacher Report gave the match itself a grade of B, stating that the match \"was a bit too predictable\", but gave the post-match grade an A+, stating that this \"was what everybody actually came to see\".  \n## Aftermath  \nDuring the 2023 WWE Draft, the Raw Women's Championship and the SmackDown Women's Championship changed brands. They were later renamed WWE Women's Championship and Women's World Championship, respectively.  \n### Raw  \nMen's Royal Rumble match winner Cody Rhodes opened the following episode of Raw, setting his sights on Roman Reigns and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 39. Afterwards, he was interrupted by The Judgment Day (Damian Priest, Dominik Mysterio, and Finn Bálor). After they mocked Rhodes' Rumble win, Edge appeared and attacked The Judgment Day. A match between Bálor and Rhodes was later scheduled for that episode's main event. During the match, The Judgment Day tried to help Bálor win, but Edge evened the odds, only to be attacked by Rhea Ripley. However, Beth Phoenix took care of Ripley, allowing Rhodes to win the match. The following week, Edge and Phoenix challenged Bálor and Ripley to a mixed tag team match at Elimination Chamber, which Bálor accepted.  \nAlso, on Raw, women's Royal Rumble match winner Rhea Ripley announced that she would challenge Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania 39. This in turn left the Raw Women's Champion without a WrestleMania opponent. As such, WWE official Adam Pearce announced that at Elimination Chamber, there would be an Elimination Chamber match with three wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown each with the winner earning a Raw Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 39. The four Royal Rumble runner ups were automatically added to the match: Asuka and Nikki Cross from Raw and Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan from SmackDown. Asuka won the match to become the number one contender for the title at WrestleMania 39.  \nBayley talked about eliminating Becky Lynch in the women's Royal Rumble match, only for Lynch to interrupt. After the two talked about their history, Lynch challenged Bayley to a Steel Cage match for the following week, but Bayley rejected. However, when Lynch brought Dakota Kai, whose ankle was wrapped around a chair, to the stage and threatened to stomp on the chair, Bayley accepted the challenge. During the match, Bayley was about to win after interference from Damage CTRL (Kai and Iyo Sky), but a returning Lita took out Kai and Sky, and helped Lynch defeat Bayley. Two weeks later, Lita and Lynch challenged Kai and Sky for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship and defeated them on the February 27 episode to win the titles thanks to a returning Trish Stratus taking out Bayley, who tried interfering. The following week, Stratus, who had retired at SummerSlam in 2019, said she was coming out of retirement so that she, Lynch, and Lita could challenge Damage CTRL to a six-woman tag team match at WrestleMania 39, and Damage CTRL accepted.  \nOn the February 6 episode of Raw, Brock Lesnar appeared with a match contract and challenged Bobby Lashley to another match at Elimination Chamber. Lashley came out and said he would give him an answer later on after reviewing the contract. Lesnar then attacked Lashley with two F-5s. An official contract signing for a match at Elimination Chamber took place the following week, and after Lashley laid out Lesnar, he signed the contract to make the match official.  \nAfter the Royal Rumble, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins began bad mouthing Logan Paul in interviews, stating that he did not want Paul to be in wrestling. At Elimination Chamber during the titular match, Paul snuck into the chamber and attacked Rollins, costing him the United States Championship. During the February 27 episode of Raw, Rollins called out Paul to meet him face-to-face on the following episode, and Paul accepted. There, Rollins wanted to fight, but Paul said he would not fight for free and hinted that they could fight at WrestleMania 39. WrestleMania host The Miz said he could make the match official, and it was later confirmed.  \n### SmackDown  \nOn the following episode of SmackDown, Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns (with Paul Heyman) talked about Sami Zayn's contributions to The Bloodline, but thought he saw greed in Zayn. Reigns then stated that Zayn used his island of relevancy. Afterwards, Zayn attacked Reigns from behind, and performed his own Spear on Reigns, only for Reigns to retreat. Zayn then challenged Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, but was attacked by Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa (Jey Uso was absent for the episode). Reigns prevented Sikoa from doing further damage to Zayn, and accepted Zayn's challenge, stating that since Zayn hurt his family, he would hurt Zayn in front of his own family in Montreal at Elimination Chamber. After Reigns retained against Zayn, Kevin Owens prevented The Bloodline (except Jey) from doing further damage to Zayn. After more weeks of feuding, including Jey turning on Zayn, Owens saved Zayn from an attack by The Usos on the March 17 episode of SmackDown, and the two embraced. It was then confirmed that Owens and Zayn would face The Usos for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 39.  \nWith women's Royal Rumble match winner Rhea Ripley choosing to challenge for the SmackDown Women's Championship, The Judgment Day (Ripley, Damian Priest, Dominik Mysterio, and Finn Bálor) began appearing on SmackDown, thus Dominik began tormenting his dad, Rey, again. After weeks of Rey refusing to attack Dominik, on the March 24 episode of SmackDown, Dominik disrespected his mother and sister, forcing Rey to intervene and hit Dominik. It was then confirmed that Rey and Dominik would face each other at WrestleMania 39. During this time, Ripley and Liv Morgan had a match on the March 3 episode, where Ripley was victorious.  \nAfter the Royal Rumble, Bray Wyatt was to begin a WrestleMania program with Bobby Lashley. However, these plans were dropped as he was taken off television in late February due to an undisclosed illness. On August 19, it was reported that the illness was life-threatening, but he was making positive progress towards a return. However, just five days later on August 24, Wyatt unexpectedly died of a heart attack. It was also revealed that the illness was COVID-19, which had exacerbated an existing heart issue. The 2023 Royal Rumble would in turn be his final televised match. His final overall match was at a WWE Live event on February 26, where he defeated LA Knight in a rematch.  \n## Results  \n### Men's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations  \nborder=silver – Raw  \nborder=silver – SmackDown  \nborder=silver – NXT  \nborder=silver – Unaffiliated  \nborder=silver – Winner  \n(HOF) – WWE Hall of Famer (at the time of the match)  \n### Women's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations  \nborder=silver – Raw  \nborder=silver – SmackDown  \nborder=silver – NXT  \nborder=silver – Unaffiliated  \nborder=silver – Winner\n\nQuestion: Which event took place at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, in January 2023, as shown in the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# 1124 papal election  \nThe 1124 papal election (held 16–21 December) took place after the death of Pope Callixtus II on 13 December 1124. The election was characterised by a power struggle between Italian cardinals supported by the Pierleoni family and northern cardinals supported by the Frangipani family. On 16 December the cardinals elected Theobaldo Boccapecci, the cardinal-priest of Sant'Anastasia. He chose the name Celestine II. Before his consecration, however, an armed party of the Frangipani attacked and wounded the newly elected pope. In the following confusion the Bishop of Ostia Lamberto Scannabecchi, the Frangipani's candidate was proclaimed pope under the name Honorius II. After several days of factional fighting Celestine was abandoned by his supporters. However, Honorius would not accept the throne in this manner and resigned as well. He was immediately re-elected and consecrated on 21 December 1124.  \n## Background  \nPressures building within the Curia, together with ongoing conflicts among the Roman nobility, would erupt after the death of Pope Callixtus II in 1124. The pontificates of Urban II and Paschal II had seen an expansion in the College of Cardinals of Italian clerics that strengthened the local Roman influence. These cardinals were reluctant to meet with the group of cardinals recently promoted by Callixtus II, who were mainly French or Burgundian. As far as the older cardinals were concerned, these newer cardinals were dangerous innovators, and they were determined to resist their increasing influence. The northern cardinals, led by Cardinal Aymeric de Bourgogne (the Papal Chancellor), were equally determined to ensure that the elected pope would be one of their candidates. Both groups looked towards the great Roman families for support.  \n<image>Plan of the medieval Lateran Basilica, with the Monastery of Saint Pancratius at upper right (south).\n\n<image>The area of medieval Rome controlled by the Frangipani family\nBy 1124, there were two great factions dominating local politics in Rome: the Frangipani family, which controlled the region around the fortified Colosseum and supported the northern cardinals, and the Pierleoni family, which controlled the Tiber Island and the fortress of the Theatre of Marcellus and supported the Italian cardinals.  With Callixtus II's death on 13 December 1124, both families agreed that the election of the next pope should be in three days time, in accordance with the church canons. The Frangipani, led by Leo Frangipani, pushed for a delay in order that they could promote their preferred candidate, Lamberto, but the people were eager to see Saxo de Anagni, the Cardinal-Priest of San Stefano in Celiomonte elected as the next pope. Leo, eager to ensure a valid election, approached key members of every Cardinal's entourage, promising each one that he would support their master when the voting for the election was underway.\n\n## Election  \nOn 16 December, the Cardinals, including Lamberto, assembled in the chapel of the monastery of St. Pancratius attached to the south of the Lateran basilica. There, at the suggestion of Jonathas, the cardinal-deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano, who was a partisan of the Pierleoni family, the Cardinals unanimously elected as Pope the cardinal-priest of Sant’ Anastasia, Theobaldo Boccapecci, who took the name Celestine II. He had only just put on the red mantle and the Te Deum was being sung when an armed party led by Roberto Frangipani (in a move pre-arranged with Cardinal Aymeric) burst in, attacked the newly enthroned Celestine, who was wounded, and acclaimed Lamberto as Pope. Since Celestine had not been formally consecrated pope, the wounded candidate declared himself willing to resign, but the Pierleoni family and their supporters refused to accept Lamberto, who in the confusion had been proclaimed Pope under the name Honorius II. Historians call the election \"a travesty of canonical procedure\".  \nRome descended into factional infighting, while Cardinal Aymeric and Leo Frangipani attempted to win over the resistance of Urban, the City Prefect, and the Pierleoni family with bribes and extravagant promises. Eventually, Celestine's supporters abandoned him, leaving Honorius the only contender for the papal throne. Honorius, unwilling to accept the throne in such a manner, resigned his position before the assembled Cardinals, but was immediately and unanimously re-elected and consecrated on 21 December 1124.  \n### Cardinals  \nThe College of Cardinals probably had between 47 and 53 members. Little information is available on which Cardinals were actually present in Rome during the election(s).  \nThe following table lists the Cardinals who were alive at the time of the electionrefn|Based on Adams and Miranda, who in turn cite other sources including Brixius, Jaffé, Hüls, Klewitz, Stroll, Pandulf of Pisa and the Annuaire Pontifical Catholique 1928.  \n#### Absentee Cardinals\n\nQuestion: Which of the following structures is depicted in both Image 1 and Image 2?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Sauerkraut missions  \nThe Sauerkraut missions (Operation Sauerkraut) were secret service operations planned and carried out by the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during the Second World War from July 1944 to at least March 1945. The aim was to enable rapid dissemination of Allied propaganda material by the use of German prisoners of war.  \nOriginal document of the OSS on the Sauerkraut missions  \n<image>Counterfeit NSDAP-party dues stamps\n\n<image>Propaganda flyer for Austria\nThe idea of utilizing German prisoners of war as agents arose after the failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler on July 20, 1944. By exploiting this unexpected psychological advantage, the deployment of apparently German soldiers in Wehrmacht uniforms was considered particularly suitable for indoctrinating the enemy without much delay.  \nIn a prisoner of war camp for Germans near Naples, efforts were made to recruit the first candidates for the mission. At the same time, suitable leaflets were developed which referred to the attempted coup on July 20 and were then to be smuggled into German territory. Thus, for example, it was claimed that Walther von Brauchitsch had taken over the command in Germany, or German troops were called upon to carry out revolutionary measures against the Nazi regime. An extra issue of the magazine Das Neue Deutschland was also produced, which pointed to alleged opposition groups within the German Reich.  \nAfter initially selecting 16 trustworthy prisoners of war, they were first transported to Rome to be equipped accordingly. This included German Wehrmacht uniforms, forged documents, weapons and compasses. Money in Italian currency, cigarettes and first aid equipment were also included. In small groups they were then smuggled across the river Arno. They were to penetrate as deeply as possible behind the German lines and spread the propaganda material they had been given. For example, leaflets and magazines were to be placed on trees, in cars, in buildings and on roads.  \nFlyer deliberately printed in  coarse quality  \nVarious gummed labels, often carried and distributed by agents  \nOf particular importance were the forged documents that were given to the agents. Since the German side was constantly changing certain recognition features for security reasons, the US side had to regularly improve them, which apparently succeeded brilliantly. Although agents of the operation were later reportedly checked by German military police on several occasions, there was only one case in which such an agent was exposed. While the forged documents had to look as perfect as possible - and this included forged party books along with the party fee stamps - the propaganda material provided was deliberately printed in a much coarser quality. This was to avoid the impression that the stickers, leaflets or magazines were material produced abroad by the enemy using high-quality printing presses.  \nIn total, about 13 missions of Operation Sauerkraut were carried out. For this purpose, small groups were smuggled behind the German lines from July 25, 1944, until at least March 21, 1945.  \nSince international law prohibits deliberately placing prisoners of war in dangerous situations, all Operation Sauerkraut personnel had to sign a declaration certifying their voluntary participation. US lawyers considered this procedure to be indispensable in the event that after the war legal action was taken against the US Army before an international court. Although the German agents of Operation Sauerkraut were promised preferential treatment for their services by the U.S. side, they were merely returned to the regular POW camps after their deployment. There they were shunned by fellow prisoners of war to the knowledge of their agent activities and despised as traitors.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following items was deliberately printed in coarse quality to avoid the impression that it was produced abroad by the enemy using high-quality printing presses during World War II?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Curtiss-Wright CW-14 Osprey  \nThe Curtiss-Wright CW-14, named variously Travel Air, Sportsman, Speedwing and Osprey is an American 3-seat open cockpit single-bay biplane from the 1930s that was developed by Travel Air as a replacement for the highly successful Travel Air 4000. As a result of the Great Depression, which also limited sales, Travel Air merged into the Curtiss-Wright group of companies before production could start, so all examples were built by Curtiss-Wright. Its main claim to fame would be as the most numerous aircraft used in the Chaco war, where it formed the backbone of the Bolivian Air Force.  \n## Design and Development  \nPrevious Travel Air biplanes had been designed under the direction of Walter Beech, however the 14 was designed by Fred Landgraff, whose previous design experience included the Rearwin Ken-Royce and Alexander Eaglerock biplanes – to which the new design owed more than it did to the Travel Air 4000/4 it was intended to replace. The handling of the aircraft reflected this, and it was described as being \"no Travel Air\".  \nOne of the possible reasons for the difference in handling may be due to the airfoil chosen – previous Travel Air biplanes had used the Travel Air #1 airfoil section, while the CW-14 used the Navy N-9 section which was also used by the Beechcraft 17 Staggerwing, and the Vought UO, while the contemporary Curtiss-Wright CW-12 and CW-16 used a 15% Clark Y.  \nWings were built around four solid spruce spars, used single piece web ribs and were fitted with Frise ailerons on the top wing only, which provided good low speed control while helping counteract adverse yaw. A plywood walkway was provided at the wing root on both sides, and the wing root was faired into the fuselage with a metal fillet. The external push-pull tubes connecting the ailerons on the upper wing to the torque tube in the lower wing on the Travel Airs was dispensed with and the control lines were run inside the struts. The main L fuel tank was in the fuselage ahead of the passenger compartment, while a usgal header tank was in the center section of the top wing. The empennage was built up from welded steel tubing, with the fin being ground adjustable for trim, and the elevators could be trimmed in flight. The B-14R & C-14R had rounded elevators of slightly reduced area.  \nThe cabane struts more closely resembled the \"//\\\" of the Eaglerock than they did the \"N\" struts of the Travel Airs, as did the fuselage's internal structure. The fuselage was constructed of welded chromium-molybdenum alloy steel tubes forming a Pratt truss buried in the lower  of the oval section fuselage, which was faired with formers and battens to a nearly ideal form. Again, unlike that of the Travel Air, no bracing wires were used, instead diagonal metal bracing kept it square. The front cockpit seated two, which unlike the Travel Air 4000, lacked the door on the left side and the corresponding dip in the left longeron. A metal cover was provided to fair over the front cockpit when not in use and dual controls were an available option at additional cost. Room for baggage was provided with a large compartment behind the pilot and a small bin in the dashboard of the front cockpit. The radial engine was enclosed in a NACA cowling to reduce drag. Only two types of engines were offered – the unreliable hp Curtiss R-600 Challenger, which was to be used only in the prototype, and several variants of the Wright Whirlwind family, ranging from hp. The militarized C-14R had a large cutout in the trailing edge of the upper wing, redesigned cabane struts and it had the cockpit shifted forward to allow room for a gunner behind the pilot.  \nAll surfaces aside from the aluminum panels on the top of the forward fuselage were covered in doped aircraft grade fabric.  \nThe split axle undercarriage used oleo-pneumatic shock absorber struts, dispensing with the bungee cords used on previous Travel Airs. It rode on 8.00 x 10 low pressure tires and was equipped with brakes. Both tailwheels and tailskids were used. A spate of accidents in Bolivia, and the resulting complaints resulted in a redesigned, taller tailskid for the Bolivian examples.  \nThe Bolivian military examples were fitted with bomb racks which were cleared to carry up to lb of bombs. These aircraft were also armed with a fixed forward firing synchronized 2 machine gun provided with 500 rounds of ammunition, while the observer/gunner was provided with a flexible 2 machine gun that could be moved between 7 different positions, although for bombing missions, the gunner was often left behind.  \n## Operational history  \nAlthough intended as a replacement for the Travel Air 4000, the era of the three seat open cockpit biplane was ending, and the Great Depression was further dampening any sales prospects. The only significant civilian sale was to the Union Oil Company, whose order of two A-14Ds (msn 2006, NC12307 & 2007, NC12310) were only to replace their well-used Travel Air 4000s.  \nA single B-14B (msn 2010, NC12332) was retained by the Curtiss Flying Service, who mainly used it as a sales demonstrator.  \nThe predecessor to the FAA, the Bureau of Air Commerce operated a single B-14B (msn 2011, NS1A, NC1A), and another was converted from a B-14B into the sole B-14R (msn 2003, NC12311) as a racing aircraft.  \nThe armed militarized C-14R Osprey variants sold better, however aside from Bolivia which received 20, all of the remaining operators, which were in Latin America, operated them only in twos and threes.  \n### Chaco War  \n<image>Curtiss-Wright CW-C-14R, mainstay of the Fuerza Aerea Nacional de Bolivia during the Chaco war, in flight\nAlthough the Bolivian C-14R Ospreys were the most widely used aircraft on either side in Chaco war, additional airframes were anticipated but were never delivered. The Ospreys that were delivered to Bolivia arrived in three batches, of 12, 6 and 3 aircraft, with the last aircraft in the third batch being seized by Chilean customs officers due to an embargo imposed by the United States. This had the effect of also cancelling a fourth order of 6 aircraft. The eventual whereabouts of the seized aircraft is unknown. Random serial numbers were assigned to all but the first couple of aircraft, which were lost in accidents before numbers could be assigned. Shortly after the last examples had been made operational, The Air Force reorganized its aircraft into units that were named for their most important type – and so the Osprey escuadrilla was formed.  \nThe first operational flight was made on 2 January 1933 during the Bolivian attack on Nanawa, where they attacked Paraguayan troop concentrations, while the first aircraft to be shot down, by ground fire, during the war was an Osprey on 25 February 1933. The first air to air kill of the war was made in a Osprey by Rafael Pabón over a Paraguayan Potez 25TOE, but he would in turn be killed when his Osprey was shot down in flames on 12 August 1934 near Fort Florida. The Bolivians would later name the Lieutenant Colonel Rafael Pabón Airport in his honor.  \nAn attack by six Ospreys on Puerto Casado on 27 April 1933 triggered protests from the Argentine government – that were reiterated when a solo flight by single Osprey dropped homemade propaganda leaflets on Concepcion in Paraguay. Argentina was at that time maintaining a position of neutrality while supplying Paraguay with equipment, but would have posed a serious threat to the Bolivians had they declared war. As it was, despite pilots flying Ospreys providing ample warning of Paraguayan movements, Commander Hans Kundt's failure to act during the Campo Vía pocket resulted in the greatest military defeat suffered by Bolivia, crippling their defences, and hastening the end of the war, to Paraguay's benefit.  \nBy the time of the armistice in June 1935, only three of the 20 were known to still be operational between accidents and combat losses. Two remained operational in January 1940, and a unfulfilled request was sent to the US authorities for spares in 1945. The last example was still shown on the books as late as 1954, albeit no longer airworthy.\n\n## Variants  \nData from Aerofiles, U.S. Civil Aircraft: Vol. 5,  \nand Curtiss Aircraft 1907-1947  \nCW-14C Travel Air: 1931 (ATC 2-357) prototype with hp Curtiss R-600 Challenger radial engine. 1 built, later converted into an A-14D  \nCW-A-14D Sportsman Deluxe: 1931 (ATC 442) hp Wright J-6-7 Whirlwind radial engine  \nCW-B-14B Speedwing: 1932 (ATC 485) with hp Wright R-975E radial engine  \nCW-B-14D Speedwing: 1 modified with hp Wright R-975-E radial engine  \nCW-B-14R (Racer): 1 built as a racer for Casey Lambert with hp Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind/SR-975 radial engine  \nCW-C-14B Osprey: 1932 Military CW-B-14B with hp Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind radial engine  \nCW-C-14R Osprey: hp Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind radial engine  \nCW-C-14B9 : Alternate designation for C-14R  \nCW-17R : Fighter development of Osprey, probably unbuilt.  \nCW-18D : Unbuilt primary trainer development of Osprey with detail changes to be powered by Wright R-760E.  \n## Operators  \n### Civil  \n* Casey Lambert had a B-14R that had been converted into a racer from a B-14B.  \n* Bureau of Air Commerce operated one CW-B-14B  \n* Curtiss Flying Service operated one CW-B-14B that was converted into a B14D.  \n* Union Oil Company operated two CW-A-14Ds  \n### Military  \n* Servicio de Aviacion Militar operated one CW-A14D Speedwing in the 1930s  \n* Fuerza Aerea Nacional de Bolivia and Fuerza Aerea Boliviana operated 20 CW-C-14R/C-14B-9 Bolivian Ospreys from 15 December 1933 to 1954  \n* Aviacion Militar operated at least three CW-14 Ospreys from December 1932 to 1939  \n* Fuerza Aerea del Ejercito Ecuatoriana operated two CW-14R Ospreys (sn 2014 & 2015) from August 1932 to 1936  \n* Fuerza Aerea Ejercito de Salvador operated three CW-14 Ospreys (sns 2033, 2034 & 2035) from August 1933 to 1942  \n* Sericio Aero Militar Venezolana operated two CW-14R Ospreys and one C-14B from August 1932 to 1938  \n## Surviving aircraft  \n<image>Curtiss-Wright CW-A-14-D NC12329 on display at the now defunct Virginia Aviation Museum\nFour surviving examples are currently on the US civil register – fully half of those that were registered in the US, although not all are likely to be in airworthy, or even displayable condition.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Joseph W. Herbert  \nJoseph W. Herbert in 1889  \nJoseph William Herbert (27 November 1863–18 February 1923) was a British-born American director, silent-film actor, singer and dramatist notable for being the first person to play Ko-Ko in America in a pirate production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado (1885) before joining D'Oyly Carte Opera Company touring companies across America (1885–1890).  \n## Early career  \nHerbert was born in Liverpool in 1863 to Irish parents and emigrated to America in 1876 aged 13,  living in Chicago where, during his college days, he joined the local Church Choir Company as an amateur chorister. He deputised for a professional comedian who failed to show to play the Lord Chancellor in the company’s production of Iolanthe and when C. D. Hess reformed the company as the Acme Opera Company and sent it on the road (1884) as a professional musical stock company, Herbert went with it. He subsequently played the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, Gobo in Les cloches de Corneville, appeared in Fatinitza, The Pirates of Penzance and Patience, played Népomuc in La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein and Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, etc, through the tour and, following the Acme troupe’s collapse, played with a stuck-together season of a stuck-together company in New Orleans.  \nHerbert was the first actor to play Ko-Ko in the United States, appearing in Sydney Rosenfeld's pirate production of The Mikado in Chicago in July 1885 before appearing in one performance (breaking a temporary injunction) in the same role at the Union Square Theatre in New York in July 1885, nearly a month before the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company arrived in America with the official production of The Mikado.  Herbert appeared as Ko-Ko for two weeks at the Union Square Theatre, opening on 17 August 1885 just two days before the D'Oyly Carte opened with their official production; Herbert and the rest of the cast then transferred to the Grand Opera House in Manhattan.  \n## D'Oyly Carte and other roles  \n<image>Sheet music cover for 'The Love-Lorn Lobster' (1897) sung by Sam Bernard with lyrics by Herbert and music by John Stromberg\nSuch was Herbert's success as Ko-Ko that he was engaged by Richard D'Oyly Carte and John Stetson to play the role in New York and New England with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's Third American Mikado Company, touring from November 1885 to May 1886. Again for Stetson Herbert played King Gama in Princess Ida from November to December 1886, and he appeared as Reginald Bunthorne in Patience during January 1887 in a D'Oyly Carte approved production in New York. He toured across North-East America for Stetson during the first half of 1887 in other D'Oyly Carte approved productions, again as King Gama in Princess Ida and later as Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore – this time in D'Oyly Carte's Second American Company.  In April 1887 he transferred to D'Oyly Carte's Third American Ruddigore Company, playing Sir Despard Murgatroyd; for a short period in early May 1887 he again played Robin Oakapple in New York.  \nHerbert played Sosoriki in the musical comedy The Pearl of Pekin (1888 and 1889); he made his last appearance with D'Oyly Carte in March 1890 when he briefly took over from Henry Lytton as the Duke of Plaza-Toro in D'Oyly Carte's recast production of The Gondoliers at Palmer's Theatre in New York; he played Mr. Auguste Pompier in the musical The Girl From Paris (1896) at the Herald Square Theatre; Count Berezowski in the operetta The Fortune Teller at Wallack's Theatre (1898); Prince Pumpernickel in the comic opera The Singing Girl (1899–1900); in the musical comedy The Rounders (1900); Maurice de Champignon in the musical comedy The Little Duchess (1901–1902); Damon Marigold in the musical comedy Sally in Our Alley (1902); Michael Dooley in the musical The Street Singer (1904); Washington Graft in The West Point Cadet (1904); The Duke of Toxen in It Happened in Nordland (1904–1905); Captain Carmona in Mexicana (1906); The Laird O'Finnan Haddock in his own About Town alongside his son, Joseph W Herbert Jr. (1906); Marquis d'Aucuneterre in Baron Trenck (1912); Count Buzot in Oh, I Say! (1913) and Duke of Crowborough in Betty (1916).  \nIn his latter years Herbert moved into the media of film, appearing in at least six silent films between 1917 and 1919 including The Divorce Game (1917), The Teeth of the Tiger (1919) and Laughing Bill Hyde (1918).\n\n## Writer and director  \n<image>The chorus in Fascinating Flora (book by R. H. Burnside and Joseph W. Herbert, music by Gustave Kerker) Casino Theatre, New York (1907)\nHerbert also carved a career as a successful dramatist and lyricist, writing firstly the book for the comedy After the Ball (1893) while his first musical was The Birth of Venus (1895) with music by Edward Jakobowski. For burlesque he wrote Thrilby (1895), a parody of the successful Trilby and with a score by Frank Osmond Carr; The Geezer (1896–97), a parody of The Geisha; The Social Whirl (1906); Fascinating Flora (1907) and wrote lyrics for The Top o' th' World (1907–1908). He authored a musical play The Prince of Borneo, which was staged in three different versions in three different continents under three different titles in search of success until it eventually emerged in 1909 as The Beauty Spot to music by Reginald De Koven. He wrote The Lamb of Delft (1911); The Duchess (1911); supplied the text for the Al Jolson vehicle The Honeymoon Express (1913); wrote lyrics for Alone at Last (1915–1916) and wrote Honeydew (1920–1921).  \nAs a writer and director Herbert adapted the farce The Turtle (1898); wrote and directed the musical comedy Tommy Rot (1902); wrote, directed and played Miche in the musical Mam'selle Napoleon (1903–1904); wrote and played Laird O'Findon Haddock in About Town (1906); wrote The Great Decide (1906); wrote and played Toby Blockett in The Orchid (1907–1908); wrote the adaptation and played Prince Lothar in A Waltz Dream (1908); wrote and directed the operetta Madame Troubadour (1910) and wrote and directed Sue, Dear (1922). Between 1903 and 1915 Herbert also worked as a stage director, directing, among others the comic opera Red Feather (1903–1904); King of Cadonia (1910); a 1910 revival of The Mikado and The Red Petticoat (1912–1913).  \nA naturalised American citizen, he  married four times: in 1888 to Nanette L. Herbert with whom he had a son, the actor and singer Joseph William Herbert Jr. (1887–1960); in 1895 to the actress Adele Ritchie (divorced); the actress Billie Norton (who he met when they appeared together in It Happened in Nordland in 1904) and Mary Lines Maynard.  \nJoseph William Herbert died of heart disease in New York in 1923 aged 59.\n\n\nQuestion: Which musical was written by Joseph W.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# 1994 in Michigan  \nEvents from the year 1994 in Michigan.  \n## Top Michigan news stories  \nNewspaper editors and broadcast news directors voted on the top news stories in Michigan for 1994 as follows:  \n-  Republican election victories. November 8 election in which John Engler was reelected to a second term as Governor and Spencer Abraham was elected U.S. Senator. In the Michigan gubernatorial election, 1994, Engler defeated Democrat Howard Wolpe by a margin of 61.5% to 38.5%. In the United States Senate election in Michigan, 1994, Abraham defeated Democrat Bob Carr by a margin of 52% to 43% with Libertarian Jon Coon receiving 4% of the votes.  \n-  Proposal A tax reform. On March 15, voters approved Proposal A by 65% to 35%. The proposal shifted funding for schools from property taxes to sales taxes. The proposal raised the state's sales tax from 4% to 6% and increased the tax on cigarettes by 50 cents.  \n-  Jack Kevorkian and assisted suicide. On May 2, a jury acquitted Jack Kevorkian in connection with the death of Thomas Hyde who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease. The trial was the first test of Michigan's assisted suicide law, adopted by the Legislature to stop Kevorkian from continuing his efforts to assist terminally ill patients to end their lives. After the verdict, Kevorkian told reporters: \"I'm prosecutable. I'm just not convictable.\" Days later, on May 10, a Michigan appellate court issued separate rulings that (i) persons assisting suicide could be prosecuted for murder, and (ii) Michigan's assisted suicide law was technically invalid but that a revised ban would be constitutional.  \n-  Growth in the Michigan economy.  \n-  Charter schools. A judge ruled charter schools unconstitutional, and the Legislature then acted to authorize and fund them.  \n-  Booming auto sales.  \n-  Deep winter freeze. Severe cold weather struck the state in January.  \n-  Detroit prison break. On August 21, 10 prisoners escaped from the Ryan Regional Correctional Facility in Detroit. Nine of the escapees were captured. The tenth was found dead.  \n-  Day-care/child custody decision. On July 8, a 69-year-old Macomb County judge ordered that custody of three-year-old Maranda Ireland-Smith be removed from her 19-year-old mother and instead be awarded to the father.  The judge found that the mother's use of commercial day care while attending classes at the University of Michigan was not in the child's best interest, whereas the father's mother was willing to care for the child full time. The decision drew national attention and criticism from working parents. The New York Times wrote that the order was \"an affront and threat to the millions of women for whom day care is the difference between ignorance and an education, poverty and a decent income, dependency and self-reliance.\" The decision was reversed on appeal in 1995.  \n-  Deckerville child abuse trial. Stephen Rogers of Deckerville and his live-in girlfriend, Trudy O'Connor, were convicted of first-degree child abuse after Rogers' nine-year-old daughter was found by police in February 1994 chained to urine-soaked bed in dark closet. Rogers was sentenced to 10–15 years in prison, and O'Connor was sentenced to a six-to-15 year term.  \nIn separate balloting by Michigan Associated Press newspapers and broadcast stations, the state's top sports stories were selected as follows:  \n-  Nancy Kerrigan assault.  On January 6, an assailant hired by the ex-husband of Tonya Harding struck Nancy Kerrigan's right knee with a club as she walked through a corridor at Detroit's Cobo Arena following a practice session at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Kerrigan was treated for her injuries at Hutzel Hospital.  \n-  Firing of George Perles. On November 8, after the 1994 Michigan State Spartans football team began the season with nine losses and no wins, George Perles was fired as the team's head coach. He had been head coach for 12 years and was the second winningest coach in program history. Nick Saban was hired as his replacement on December 3.  \n-  Baseball strike. On September 14, the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike began. The strike resulted in the cancellation of the final weeks of the season as well as the World Series.  \n-  World Cup in Michigan. The 1994 FIFA World Cup had several games played at the Pontiac Silverdome, including a 1–1 tie between USA and Switzerland.  \n-  Isiah Thomas.  Isiah Thomas was offered a $55 million contract with the Pistons but took a post with Toronto instead.  \n- Detroit Red Wings lost in first round of playoffs and Bryan Murray fired as GM.  \n-  The 1994–95 NHL lockout.  \n-  Grant Hill signed. The Pistons selected Grant Hill with the third overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft.  \n-  The 1993 Michigan Wolverines football team, including Colorado's victory in the Miracle at Michigan.  \n-  Scott Mitchell signed. After losing Erik Kramer to free agency, the Detroit Lions on March 7 signed free agent quarterback Scott Mitchell to an $11 million contract, including a $5 million signing bonus.  \n## Office holders  \n### State office holders  \nGov.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Shadwell forgeries  \nThe Shadwell forgeries, also known as the Shadwell Dock forgeries, the Shadwell Shams, or the Billy and Charley forgeries, were a series of mid-19th-century forgeries of medieval lead and lead-alloy artefacts. The latter name derives from the two Londoners, William \"Billy\" Smith and Charles \"Charley\" Eaton, who were responsible for their large-scale manufacture between 1857 and 1870. At the time, some antiquarians were fooled by the forgeries, despite them being crudely made by two individuals with limited skill in metalworking and little knowledge of medieval art.  \nToday, Billy and Charleys are viewed as examples of naïve art or outsider art. A number of museums hold collections of them and they are sought-after collectible items in their own right. They have been sold for prices equalling or exceeding the values of examples of the medieval originals they purported to be.  Because of this, modern fake Billy and Charleys are  reportedly in circulation.  \n## William Smith and Charles Eaton  \nLittle is known of the lives of William Smith (dates unknown) and Charles Eaton (c.1834–1870) except that when young they were mudlarks – individuals that made a small living by searching the mudflats of the River Thames at low-tide, seeking any item of value. They lived in Rosemary Lane (now called Royal Mint Street) in what is now part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.  \nIn 1844 or 1845, Smith came into contact with an antique dealer, William Edwards; Eaton met Edwards some years later. Edwards came to view the pair as \"his boys\" and frequently bought from them items of interest they found while mudlarking. In 1857, the two began to manufacture counterfeit artefacts to sell to Edwards.  \n## Forgeries  \n<image>A Billy and Charley lead plaque. in Auckland War Memorial Museum, accession number 1932.427\n\n<image>A lead Billy and Charley medallion, in in diameter, in thick and weighing oz. One side shows the profile head of a man wearing a crown; the other shows the head of a helmeted knight. The medallion is dated \"1030\". United Kingdom Portable Antiquities Scheme\nDuring their career, Smith and Eaton are estimated to have made between 5,000 and 10,000 items of many kinds, including pilgrim badges, ampulla, statuettes, portable shrines, coins, medallions and ornamental spearheads. Initially they were all made from lead or pewter, but later the two also used a copper-lead alloy. The items were cast using plaster of Paris moulds, into which a design was engraved by hand. They were then given the appearance of age by being bathed in acid and coated with river mud.  \nThe most common type of Billy and Charley were medallions, around 0 in diameter. These had crude depictions of knights in armour, crowned kings or religious figures. They often carried inscriptions, but as Smith and Eaton were illiterate, these were meaningless. To give the appearance of age, many of the items also carried dates between the 11th century and the 16th century. However the dates were inscribed using Arabic numerals which only came into use in England during the 15th century and so are anachronistic on the \"older\" items.  \nSmith and Eaton sold their forgeries to Edwards, selling around 1100 items between 1857 and 1858 for a total of £200. The two claimed the source of the steady stream of antiquities was the large-scale excavations then taking place as part of the construction of London's Shadwell Dock. In June 1857, Edwards showed samples to another antique dealer, George Eastwood. Eastwood bought the 1100 items from Edwards, before bypassing him and buying further supplies directly from Smith and Eaton.  \nEastwood advertised them as a \"A remarkable curious and unique collection of leaden signs or badges of the time of Richard II\",. He sold them to several customers, including to one person buying them on behalf of the British Museum.\n\n## Libel trial  \n<image>A Billy and Charley in the form of a lead statuette, in high; probably intended to represent a bishop. Manchester Museum, accession number 1981.1150.\nBy 1858, Henry Syer Cuming, the secretary of the British Archaeological Association, together with the archaeologist Thomas Bateman, had noticed the appearance of large numbers of medieval artefacts for sale which they suspected to be forgeries from a single source. On 28 April, Cuming delivered a lecture, Some Recent Forgeries in Lead, to the British Archaeological Association in which he condemned them as \"Gross attempts at deception\".  \nThe lecture was reported in The Gentleman's Magazine and The Athenaeum. George Eastwood responded firstly with a letter defending the authenticity of the items he was selling, and then by suing the publishers of The Athenaeum for libel. He had not been named in the magazine's report but he was the only seller of the items so his complaint was that the Athaenum had libelled him implicitly and damaged his business.  \nThe trial was held at Guildford Assizes on 4 August 1858. The judge was Sir James Shaw Willes, Eastwood was represented by Edwin James QC. The Athenaeum was represented by Montague Chambers QC.  \nWilliam Smith (described in a newspaper report as a \"rough looking young man\") was one of the witnesses. In his testimony, Smith claimed he had obtained them from the Shadwell Dock construction site, by bribing the navvies building the dock with money and drink, and by sneaking onto the site himself after hours. He testified he had sold around 2000 items, making around £400. Examples of the artefacts were presented to the courts as exhibits; according to The Times newspaper report, \"a good deal of amusement was produced by the extraordinary nature of some of those that were produced.\"  \nCharles Roach Smith, a leading antiquarian and co-founder of the British Archaeological Association, testified to the authenticity of the Billy and Charleys. Before the trial, Roach-Smith had stated their very crudity was an argument for their authenticity – he assumed any 19th-century forger intent on deception would simply have done a better job in making them. Under examination during the trial, he stated his belief that they were a previously unknown class of object with an unknown purpose. However, he was confident of their age.  \nThe Rev. Thomas Hugo, vicar of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and a published author on the subject, gave testimony that supported Roach-Smith, stating that the items dated from the 15th or 16th centuries,  although under cross-examination he was unable to state exactly why he thought so. The artist and antiquary Frederick William Fairholt also testified that he believed them authentic, as did two other antique dealers.  \nThe Athenaeum had not named George Eastwood in its report so the trial judge directed the jury to find the magazine publishers not-guilty of libel, but it was asked to affirm its faith in Eastwood's integrity.\n\n## Subsequent history  \nThe libel trial attracted widespread publicity. Even though Eastwood failed to convict The Athenaeum of libel, the result gave the appearance of endorsing the authenticity of his stock, and his sales increased.  \nRoach-Smith reported on the trial in The Gentleman's Magazine, stating his theory the items were of 16th century origin. In 1861, he published volume five of his work, Collectanea antiqua. This included an article stating the items were crude, religious tokens, dating from the reign of Mary I of England, that had been imported from continental Europe as replacements for the devotional items destroyed during the English Reformation.  \nIronically, earlier volumes of the Collectanea antiqua had been among the scholarly reference works used by Smith and Eaton when creating their fakes.  \nMeanwhile, the businessman, politician and antiquarian Charles Reed had renewed the investigation of the artefacts; although he may have been prompted by Roach-Smith's book. He made inquiries in the Shadwell Dock construction site, but could not find anyone that had sold items to Smith or Eaton. He gained the confidence of a tosher (one who scavenges in sewers), who confirmed that Smith and Eaton had been selling forgeries. He was introduced to Smith and Eaton, and gained their trust, but paid the tosher to break into their workshop and steal several of their moulds; these were exhibited at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London in March 1861 as proof the items were fakes.  \n## Later career of Smith and Eaton  \nDespite their exposure, Smith and Eaton continued to make and sell forgeries throughout the 1860s. They began using a lead-copper alloy known as cock metal and their work showed somewhat improved craftsmanship. But increasing awareness of their activities made it harder for them to sell their forgeries. In 1867 they were arrested in Windsor, Berkshire after a local clergyman recognised the items they were selling. In court, there was found to be insufficient evidence to prosecute and they were released.  \nCharley Eaton died in January 1870 of consumption. William Smith's last appearance in the historical record was in 1871, when he was attempting to sell a copy of a 13th-century lead jug. Nothing further is known of him.  \n## Collections  \nExamples of Billy and Charleys are in the collections of the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Museum of London. Many are held by the Cuming Museum, which includes the personal collection of Henry Syer Cuming.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true about the artifacts depicted in the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

He lives and works in Berlin. László Lakner was born in Budapest in 1936 to an architect of the same name and his wife Sara, born a Sárközy. Lakner is the father of the Hungarian artist Antal Lakner, who was born in 1966. After a long period in the cities Essen and Berlin, László Lakner now lives and works exclusively in Berlin, in the Charlottenburg district. Among other art shows, he was invited three times to participate in the Venice Biennale (1972, 1976 and 1990) and once to documenta in Kassel (1977). <image>László Lakner, \"My Georg Lukács Book\", 1970, photo / screenprint, 70 × 50 cm. The title of Lukács's book is: \"Peculiarity of the Aesthetic\"\n\n\n## The artist  \nFrom 1950, László Lakner attended the Art Gymnasium in his native home Budapest. He then studied painting with Professor Aurél Bernáth at the Hungarian Academy for Fine Arts in Budapest from 1954 until his graduation in 1960. In 1959 he created the first of numerous works of art based on found photographs. In 1963, Lakner was approved for his first trip to Western countries. He visited the Federal Republic of Germany and attended the Venice Biennale in Italy in 1964. In 1968 he traveled on a scholarship from the Museum Folkwang, which permitted him a return to the Federal Republic of Germany and a visit to Switzerland In 1972, Lakner worked for two months in the famous guest house of the Museum Folkwang in the city of Essen, where Martin Kippenberger also worked in a studio some years later. In 1974, he was invited to Berlin with a DAAD scholarship for the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program and decided to emigrate to Germany. In 1976 he was awarded the Bremen \"Art Prize of Böttcherstraße\" and in 1977 he was invited to the documenta VI in Kassel with several works exhibited from the fields of painting, drawing and book objects.  \nIn the same year he received the German Critics' Prize and worked during 1981-1982 with a scholarship from the Berlin Senate in New York at MOMA P.S.1 art studio and gallery, at the same time as the Essen sculptor Carl Emanuel Wolff.  \nIn 1998, he received the Kossuth Prize, the most prestigious Hungarian State Prize for his artistic work. In 2000, his self-portrait was included in the collection of the Uffizi Gallery / Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence.  \n<image>László Lakner,  \"Marcel Duchamp\", 1975-1976, oil on canvas, 190 × 140 cm, State Museums of Berlin, National Gallery Berlin\n\n\n## The teacher  \nIn 1979, Prof. Paul Vogt, the director of the Museum Folkwang, initiated the appointment of László Lakner as a lecturer of painting at the Essen University of Applied Sciences. He also lectured in the Department of Art History at the Free University of Berlin between 1979 and 1980. In 1982 he was finally appointed to the University of Essen (now the University of Duisburg-Essen), where he taught as a professor of experimental design until his retirement in 2001. In these 19 years he worked in Berlin and in his studio in Essen, which he left after 2002 to settle permanently in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin. Lakner's professorship for experimental design, later occupied by Jörg Eberhard, required a multidisciplinary expertise, as he supervised students from both the University of Essen and the current Folkwang University of the Arts. His students from this period include, among others, the cabaret artist and photographer Dieter Nuhr, painters Dirk Hupe, Jürgen Paas, Eberhard Ross, photographer and stage designer Johannes Gramm, Günter Sponheuer and Frank Piasta  \nTondo Mouth 1968, oil on canvas,  ø 140 cm, Collection Janus Pannonius Museum, Pécs  \n## Development of artwork  \nSince his beginnings in the 1950s, Lakner's work has moved with great flexibility and ease among many artistic forms, such as realistic and object-free representations in painting, photography, textual work, film, objects and sculptures. Most of his work was powered by his conceptual way of thinking, and independent of the art form and media used.  \nHe turned his attention repeatedly to the same topics and motives within language, literature and the appearance of writing (see Paul Celan pictures). The artistic results could be transformations of books or manuscripts through paintings or the integrations of books into art objects (see Buchaxt (book-axe)). Other topics include the representations of heads and skulls (see Bandaged Heads) as metaphors or symbolisms of death.  \nWhen Lakner modified objects and written texts from famous artists and philosophers, he created a new artistic environment for them. The transition of one art form into another enabled Lakner to add complementary meanings to the quoted works, which would have been impossible if they remained in their original art form.  \nThis recontextualisation could inspire associations with powerful symbolic potential. Since his artistic origins are in realism, Lakner's artwork has evolved using a rich artistic language full of interwoven references and meanings.  \n### 1950s to 1970s  \n#### Painting  \nLakner participated in IPARTERV exhibitions in Budapest in 1968 and 1969, which united the leading critical avant-garde artists in Hungary. In doing so, he presented works that subtly contained contemporary and cultural references. Besides object-free representations that were understood to be experimental, he was beginning to paint highly realistic images of found photographic documents in the late 1950s.  \nWhilst demonstrating his virtuosity through painting, Lakner inspired associations between the history of art and contemporary political issues (see Seamstresses listen to a speech by Hitler).  \nLakner also closely examined the appropriateness of the artistic media used in Eastern European countries with their respective social reality. His observations allowed him to delve deeper into the world of realistic painting.  \nLakner also created images that could be attributed to Pop Art (see Rose, 1968, Mund-Tondo / Mouth-Tondo, 1968, Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest). He also experimented with assemblages (see Fugitives, 1966, Hungarian National Gallery and Letter to Barbara, 1964), monochrome paintings, posters and conceptual art; they incorporated sometimes humor. Furthermore, he also painted twin images that juxtaposed the same motif but with different details (see Danae, 1967, Ludwig-Múzeum, Budapest). Here, Lakner examined the limitations and possibilities within his realistic representations, creating a lasting theme that he continued to work with in Germany.  \n<image>László Lakner, \"Isa pur\", 1982, mixed media on bed sheets, 260 × 220 cm. Lakner cites from the oldest Hungarian text written in Latin script, The Funeral Sermon and Prayer: “Behold, we are dust and ashes”\n\n\n#### Conceptual art  \nIn his conceptual art Lakner applies various methods of artistic transformation of literature as well as language. A major work in 1970 used a book on aesthetics, written by the Hungarian philosopher George Lukács, who signed it for him. Lakner tied it shut using a piece of string. He then placed the laced book on his studio wall, photographed it and then transformed it into a screen printed image. This work (and its novel method of fabrication) was exhibited in 1972 at the Venice Biennale in the International Pavilion. Lakner continued working with this process by lacing other books, as well as creating photorealistic paintings of such situations.  \nA similarly photorealistic painting is his naked self-portrait, in which he stands looking at the viewer, wearing only flip-flops and sunglasses. It is regarded as an outstanding political statement on the situation of the artist in the repressive Hungarian regime (see Self-portrait with self-timer, 1970, Uffizi Gallery, Florence. The wish for change inspired many of his works (see Monument of the Revolutions, 1971, Museum Folkwang, Essen and Barricade 1970 / oil on canvas / 150 × 200 cm). He continued to base his photorealistic paintings on photographic documents, often in brown-grey colours, brilliantly painting the change of sharpness in the depth of field from the original photo (Silence, Homage to Joseph Beuys, 1972 Ludwig Museum, Budapest).  \nHis attention turned increasingly to historical documents from different centuries, such as letters, dispatches or testaments. He carefully re-represented manuscripts, often written by famous people, showing them in front of a spatial background (see After Schopenhauer / Fragment). This is the continuation of the previously mentioned usage of quotes in new artistic contexts, as well as an innovative exploration of using written text as a subject in paintings. This liberates the viewer to see them from a purely aesthetic perspective; as colour and shape (see Cézanne's Last Letter, 1975, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam). During this time Lakner received a DAAD scholarship in Berlin and migrated to the Federal Republic of Germany (1974).  \nBarricade 1970 / oil on canvas / 150 × 200 cm  \n### 1980s to the present  \nLakner's guest stay 1981-1982 in New York at MoMA PS1 studio and gallery  was significant. Here Lakner experienced the illness and death of a good friend. During this time, he became also aware of graffiti on the walls of houses and in subway shafts. As a result, he painted on large bed sheets, in which individual words or slogans were applied with spray paint. \"At that time, the graffiti of the Puerto Rican boys in the streets of New York meant more to me than anything else I saw in museums and galleries.\" He wanted \"Black Milk\", the words from Paul Celan's poem Death Fugue, \"written big on a wall with a flamethrower.\" In Isa Pur, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, he cites the oldest Hungarian Funeral Sermon and Prayer written in Latin script: “Behold, we are dust and ashes”. The single letters above the patchy colored ground are created by spray paint, or the paint is scratched away, reinforcing his narrative about life and death.  \nFrom the second half of the 1980s the abstract drawings, which could partly be read as rudimentary writing, were etched on thick impasto layers of paint. This technique resulted in pictures with graphic entanglements and lines above the color ground (see work group of splitted images on a box-like deep canvas, 1994). In addition, he also made realistic sculptural works in bronze, which integrated not only the human figure, but also books (see Babel, 1985). On the monument for the Hungarian poet Miklós Radnóti, Lakner shows his inner impressions and feelings, created by the poems, on the surface of an imaginary book, which is cast in bronze. The scripture on the tombstone of John Keats, the romantic English poet, ‘Here lies one whose name is writ in water’, inspired Lakner's painting, Keats' grave.  \nFrom the mid-1990s, Lakner's interest returned to photography, which he was able to use conceptually. For example, in Paris he walked around in circles at the fictitious place where the poet Paul Celan committed suicide. Later, he created large-format photo sequences of these places (see exhibition 1999, Galerie Nothelfer, Berlin). In addition, representational images were also created with a new examination of the classical art of painting (see Berenice according to Edgar Allan Poe, 2004 – 2010).  \nChinese Postcard, 1972 in the possession of the artist  \n## Interest in Asian cultures  \nDuring the Vietnam war (1955-1975) Lakner's interest turned to Asia. Although he did not understand the meaning of calligraphies he saw, he was fascinated by their form and began to paint them. Often, he did not follow the method of calligraphy (painting with ink on rice paper with fast movements), but painted them with oil on canvas with meticulous precision. Not limiting himself with only that technique, he also completely reimagined the Little Red Book \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung\" and created a new version of it with the title MAO BIBLE. Instead of being a source of Mao's ideology for the Cultural Revolution, the book is tightly bound with ropes and it is not possible to open it. Some versions of this \"Bible\" are cast in bronze.  \nAnother work was produced from an idealised Chinese photo, depicting farmers in the mountains being helped by Chinese soldiers. Lakner enlarged it to create a human-size photorealistic painting. The hand-written greeting of the newspaper editor who sent the photo to him, is also painted on the canvas.  \nThus, the results of Lakner's Asian inspirations are artworks which are, despite their Asian topics, not copies of Asian art. They are rather transformations from Asian into Western traditions. They represent Lakner's conceptual innovations and multitude of artistic methods, with which he continues to explore the world.  \n## Works in public collections  \n* Germany:  \n* * Museum Ludwig, Aachen  \n* * Nationalgalerie, Berlin  \n* * Berlinische Galerie, Berlin  \n* * Paula Modersohn-Becker Foundation, Bremen  \n* * Museum Folkwang, Essen  \n* * Art collection of the University of Freiburg im Breisgau  \n* * Museum Ludwig, Köln  \n* * Von der Heydt-Museum, Wuppertal  \n* * Neues Museum Weserburg, Bremen, from 2010 Kunsthalle, Bremen  \n* Netherlands:  \n* * Museum Boymans van Beuningen, Rotterdam  \n* Poland:  \n* * Museum of modern art, Łódź  \n* Hungary:  \n* * Hungarian National Gallery,  Budapest  \n* * Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest  \n* * Ludwig-Museum, Budapest  \n* * Petöfi-Literatur-Museum, Budapest  \n* * Kiscelli-Museum, Budapest  \n* * Xántus János Museum, Győr  \n* * Városi Müvészeti Museum, Győr  \n* * Hatvany Lajos Museum, Hatvan  \n* * Janus Pannonius Museum, Pécs  \n* * Vasarely Museum, Pécs  \n* * Szent István Király Museum, Székesfehérvár  \n* * Szombathelyi Képtar, Szombathely  \n* Great Britain:  \n* * Victoria and Albert Museum, London  \n* Italy:  \n* * Uffizi Gallery, Florenz  \n* Japan:  \n* * Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokio  \n## Exhibitions  \nSolo exhibitions (selection):  \n* 1969 KKI Galeria, Budapest  \n* 1974 Neue Galerie – Collection Ludwig, Aachen  \n* 1975 Overbeck-Gesellschaft, Lübeck  \n* 1975 Neuer Berliner Kunstverein und DAAD, Berlin  \n* 1975 Galerie Folker Skulima, Berlin  \n* 1976 Galerie Denise René-Hans Mayer, Düsseldorf  \n* 1979 Westfälischer Kunstverein, Münster  \n* 1983 Galerie Bertha Urdang, New York  \n* 1987 Forum Kunst, Rottweil  \n* 1998 Stadsschouwburg Heerlen, Niederlande  \n* 2004 Zacheta Narodowa Galeria Sztuki (Nationalgalerie), Warschau  \n* 2004 Galeria Sztuki (Kunsthalle), Posen, Polen  \n* 2004 Ludwig-Museum, Budapest  \n* 2006 Augsburger Kunstverein  \n* 2006 Galerie Georg Nothelfer, Berlin  \n* 2007 Petöfi Irodalmi Museum, Budapest  \n* 2011 Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest  \nParticipations in exhibitions:  \n* 1967 XV.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# List of municipalities in Prince Edward Island  \nA map of Canada, showing Prince Edward Island in red.  \n<image>Distribution of Prince Edward Island's 72 municipalities by municipal status type 2017\nPrince Edward Island is the least populous province in Canada with 154,331 residents as of the 2021 census and is the smallest in land area at abbr=on. Prince Edward Island's 63 municipalities cover 1 of the province's land mass and were home to 154331 of its population in 2021. These municipalities provide local government services to their residents in the form of fire protection, municipal planning services, and emergency measures planning. The remaining unincorporated areas have no local government.  \nMunicipal statuses in Prince Edward Island are cities, towns, rural municipalities, and resort municipalities. Under Prince Edward Island's Municipal Government Act (MGA), which came into force on December 23, 2017, the formation of a municipality can be proposed by the Minister of Fisheries and Communities, the council of an existing municipality, or a petition signed by 30% of the residents that would be the electors of the new municipality. To be eligible for city or town status, certain minimum estimated population and total property assessment value criteria must be met. If those criteria are not met, rural municipality status can be granted if it is the opinion of the Minister of Fisheries and Communities that it would be in the public interest. The province's lone resort municipality – the Resort Municipality of Stanley Bridge, Hope River, Bayview, Cavendish and North Rustico – was established by order in council in 1990. The 2017 Municipal Government Act prevents creation of any new resort municipalities.  \nPrince Edward Island has two cities, ten towns, fifty rural municipalities and one resort municipality, which are distributed across three counties – Kings, Prince and Queens. Charlottetown is Prince Edward Island's capital and largest municipality by population while Belfast is the largest municipality by land area. The smallest municipalities by population and land area are Tignish Shore and St. Louis respectively.\n\n## Cities  \n<image>Aerial view of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island's capital and largest city\n\n<image>Summerside, Prince Edward Island's second largest municipality and only other city\nUnder the province's Municipal Government Act, a municipality may incorporate as a city if it has an estimated population of 15,000 or more and a total property assessment value of $750 million or more. Should a city no longer meet these requirements, the Minister of Fisheries and Communities may recommend to the Lieutenant Governor in Council to change the status of the municipality to a more appropriate status.  \nPrince Edward Island has two cities. Charlottetown is Prince Edward Island's capital and largest city both by population with 38,809 residents and by land area with abbr=on. It forms the core of a census agglomeration that encompasses the middle of the island and is home to 78,858 residents, or 154331 of the island's population. The province's second city is Summerside, which is located on the west side of the island. It has a population of 16,001 and a land area of abbr=on. Starting with the municipal elections in 2018, the Municipal Government Act enables cities to elect a mayor and a minimum of eight councillors. With general municipal elections occurring every four years, the next municipal election is scheduled for November 2022.\n\n## Towns  \nUnder the province's Municipal Government Act, a municipality may incorporate as a town if has an estimated population of 4,000 or more but is less than 15,000, and a total property assessment value of $200 million or more, but is less than $750 million. Should a town no longer meet these requirements, the Minister of Fisheries and Communities may recommend to the Lieutenant Governor in Council to change the status of the municipality to a more appropriate status.  \nPrince Edward Island has ten towns that are incorporated municipalities, which had a cumulative population of 32,632 in the 2021 census. The province's largest and smallest towns are Stratford and North Rustico with populations of 10,927 and 648 respectively. Three Rivers is Prince Edward Island's largest town by land area with abbr=on and O'Leary is the province's smallest town by land area with abbr=on. Three Rivers is also the province's newest town, which incorporated as a town on September 28, 2018 through the amalgamation of the towns of Georgetown and Montague, five rural municipalities (Brudenell, Cardigan, Lorne Valley, Lower Montague, and Valleyfield), and portions of three adjacent unincorporated areas. Starting with the municipal elections in 2018, the Municipal Government Act enables towns to elect a mayor and a minimum of six councillors. With general municipal elections occurring every four years, the next municipal election is scheduled for November 2022.  \n## Rural municipalities  \nUnder the province's Municipal Government Act, municipalities that previously held community status under the previous Municipalities Act, which originally came into force in 1983, were carried forward as rural municipalities. With the amalgamation of Brackley and Winsloe South on December 15, 2017, and then the Municipal Government Act coming into force eight days later on December 23, 2017, Prince Edward Island had 58 communities that became rural municipalities. On September 28, 2018, three amalgamations reduced the total amount of rural municipalities to 50. As of the 2021 census, the province's largest and smallest rural municipalities are West River and Tignish Shore with populations of 3,473 and 64 respectively. Starting with the municipal elections in 2018, the Municipal Government Act enables rural municipalities to elect a mayor and a minimum of six councillors. With general municipal elections occurring every four years, the next municipal election is scheduled for November 2022.  \n## Resort municipalities  \nPrince Edward Island has one municipality holding resort municipality status. The Resort Municipality of Stanley Bridge, Hope River, Bayview, Cavendish and North Rustico was established as a resort municipality in 1990. The province's Municipal Government Act allows this resort municipality to continue yet prevents the establishment of additional resort municipalities in the future. Starting with the municipal elections in 2018, the Municipal Government Act enables  the province's lone resort municipality to elect a mayor and a minimum of six councillors. With general municipal elections occurring every four years, the next municipal election is scheduled for November 2022. If the population of the lone resort municipality reaches 2,000 electors, it may be incorporated as a different type of municipality pursuant to the Municipal Government Act.  \n## List of municipalities\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the municipalities of Prince Edward Island (PEI) is correct based on the provided images and text?\nChoice list: \nA.

Serving as a sequel to The Nun (2018) and the eighth installment in The Conjuring Universe franchise, the film stars Taissa Farmiga, Jonas Bloquet, and Bonnie Aarons, returning from the first film, with Storm Reid and Anna Popplewell joining the cast. Peter Safran and James Wan return as producers.  \nIn 2017, Wan discussed the possibility of a Nun sequel and by 2019, Safran revealed that the film was in early development. Cooper was initially hired as the sole writer, before Goldberg and Naing contributed as screenwriters to the final script. Chaves, who had previously helmed The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021), was announced as director. Principal photography began in October 2022 in France.  \nThe Nun II was released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on September 8, 2023. The film grossed $265 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, though some deemed it an improvement over its predecessor.  \n## Plot  \nIn 1956, Father Noiret and young Jacques perform their daily chores in their church in Tarascon, France. While investigating a disturbance, Noiret is raised into the air, set on fire, and burned to death before a terrified Jacques who then flees.  \nFour years following the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has befriended a young Irish student named Sophie and her teacher and mother, Kate. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him. She is dispatched by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe, attributed to the demon Valak, due to her previous experience with the demon. She travels to Tarascon with Sister Debra, a young novice who expresses her difficulty in accepting miracles, such as the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Meanwhile, a delivery girl witnesses Valak talking to a possessed Maurice before Valak kills her.  \n<image>A version of the Saint Lucy by Italian painter Beccafumi is shown in some sequences\nIn Tarascon, Irene is haunted by Valak and has a strange vision. Sister Debra tells Irene that she received Noiret's rosary from Jacques. At school, Sophie is bullied by classmates and locked in the deconsecrated sealed-off chapel. The bully points out the goat on the stained-glass window, claiming the devil appears when the sun shines through and turns the goat's eyes red. One night, the headmistress encounters a sleepwalking Maurice and is killed by Valak in the guise of her deceased son.  \nIrene and Debra travel to the Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian. He explains that Valak was an angel rejected by God and the emblem on Noiret's rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire, she miraculously did not burn; her eyes were gouged out, but her family recovered them. The librarian suggests the demon is killing St. Lucy's descendants because it wants this powerful relic, last known to be stored in a former monastery-turned-winery. The winery then became the present-day boarding school.  \nAt the school, Irene and Debra face off against a fully possessed Maurice. Sophie shows the women the stained-glass goat in the chapel and they use a flashlight to make its eyes glow red. The red light acts as a laser, pointing to where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried. Irene finds the relic and the stained-glass goat vanishes, reappearing in real life as a demonic creature.  \nAs the goat attacks the students, Maurice attacks Irene, chases Sophie, and causes the bell tower to collapse. Debra admits to Irene that she now has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice, but he grabs it, causing Valak to appear. Similar to Father Noiret, Valak lifts Irene in the air and sets her ablaze. Irene does not burn as Valak realizes she is a descendant of St. Lucy, able to harness the same power associated with the relic. Irene and Debra pray, with faith, the Words of Institution used in Christian celebrations of the Eucharist and the old barrels of wine in the room become the blood of Christ, banishing the demon. With Valak gone, Irene and Debra managed to free Maurice of possession and save his life.  \nThe next morning, Irene leads Maurice outside and helps him to regain his senses. However, she becomes concerned as she watches him going with Sophie and Kate inside.\n\n## Cast  \n* Taissa Farmiga as Sister Irene Palmer  \n* * Margot Bernazzi as young Irene  \n* Jonas Bloquet as Maurice  \n* Storm Reid as Sister Debra  \n* Anna Popplewell as Kate  \n* Bonnie Aarons as The Demon Nun  \n* Katelyn Rose Downey as Sophie  \n* Suzanne Bertish as Madame Laurent  \n* Léontine d'Oncieu as Simone  \n* Anouk Darwin Homewood as Celeste  \n* Maxime Elias-Menet as Jacques  \n* Pascal Aubert as Father Noiret  \n* David Horovitch as Cardinal Conroy  \n* Kate Colebrook as Irene's Mom / Saint Lucy  \n* Andrew Morgado provides the demonic voice  \nAdditionally, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren respectively in the mid-credits scene, using archived footage from The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.  \n## Production  \n<image>Former Couvent des Prêcheurs monastery in Aix-en-Provence, the location of the boarding school in the film.\nArc de Boqui in Tarascon, one of the filming locations.\n<image>Chapelle des Ursulines d'Aix-en-Provence aka. Chapelle Sainte Catherine de Sienne in Aix-en-Provence portrays the church of Tarascon in the film.\n\n\n### Development  \nIn August 2017, Wan discussed the possibility of a Nun sequel and what its story may be: \"I do know where potentially, if The Nun works out, where The Nun 2 could lead to and how that ties back to Lorraine's story that we've set up with the first two Conjurings and make it all come full circle.\"  \nIn April 2019, it was announced by Peter Safran that a sequel was in development. Safran stated that there was a \"really fun\" storyline planned for the film and commented that there was an \"inevitability to another The Nun movie\". Later that month, Akela Cooper signed onto the project as screenwriter while Safran and James Wan agreed to serve as producers.  \nIn February 2022, Taissa Farmiga stated that she had had discussions with Warner Bros. Pictures to reprise her role from the first film while stating that the restrictions on the film industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic had delayed the project. In April 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures officially announced the movie as a part of its upcoming slate at the 2022 CinemaCon. The following day, it was announced that Michael Chaves would direct the film.  \nIn September 2022, it was revealed that Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing had contributed as screenwriting co-authors of the most recent draft of the script.  \n### Casting  \nIn April 2022, James Wan confirmed that Bonnie Aarons would be reprising her role as Valak. In September 2022, Storm Reid was cast as a new lead. In October 2022, Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet were confirmed to be reprising their roles from the first film, with Anna Popplewell and Katelyn Rose Downey added to the cast later that month.  \n### Filming  \nPreliminary production photography began on April 29, 2022. Filming was originally scheduled to start on September 5, 2022. Principal photography began in France on October 6, 2022, and concluded later that year. Filming locations include the former Couvent des Prêcheurs d'Aix-en-Provence monastery in Aix-en-Provence and rue Proudhon in Tarascon.  \n## Release  \nThe Nun II was theatrically released in the United States on September 8, 2023, by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema.  \n### Home media  \nThe Nun II was released on digital download on October 3, 2023, and is scheduled to be released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on November 14, 2023 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.  \n## Reception  \n### Box office  \n, The Nun II has grossed $85.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $179.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $265.7 million.  \nIn the United States, The Nun II was released alongside My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3, and was projected to gross $31–34 million from 3,728 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $13 million on its first day, including $3.1 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $32.6 million, topping the box office. In its second weekend the film made $14.5 million, dropping 55.4% and topping newcomer A Haunting in Venice ($14.3 million). The film made $8.6 million in its third weekend, topping the box office again whilst narrowly defeating another new release, The Expendables 4 ($8.4 million).  \n### Critical response  \naccess-date=September 14, 2023 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale (up from the first film's \"C\"), while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 64% overall positive score, with 47% saying they would definitely recommend the film.  \nFrank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The filmmaker does a fine job creating a suitably ominous atmosphere (the old-world European locations and Tristan Nyby's gloomy cinematography really help) and orchestrates the violent mayhem, much of it involving terrified little girls, with disturbing relish.\" The Timess Ed Potton gave the film 3/5 stars, saying it \"often flirts with ridiculousness\", but praised Chaves's direction, Farmiga and Downey's performances and the finale. CNN's Brian Lowry called the film \"a slick if familiar addition to the very fertile Conjuring universe that, by deftly expanding on the 2018 hit, appears destined to become another cinematic habit.\" Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, \"In some respects an improvement on its predecessor, in others not, this is finally one more good-enough if unmemorable entry sure to extend the series' life in lucrative fashion.\"  \nBob Smithouser of Plugged In stated that \"The Nun II is one of the purest cinematic versions of palpable image over substance that I've seen in some time.\" Claire Shaffer of The New York Times said the film \"runs like haunted clockwork, shoving characters down dark alleyways or abandoned chapels every five minutes with little justification. Scene after scene builds fear and tension, and then a monster appears, and then … not much else, in most cases.\" The Sydney Morning Heralds Jake Wilson gave it 2/5 stars, writing, \"The shocks are brief and not too grisly, the dingy Gothic look is as you'd expect, and the mechanical climax steers clear of the more unsettling possibilities that might have emerged if Frenchie's Jekyll and Hyde sides had been meaningfully linked.\" Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press gave it 1/5 stars, writing, \"A new directing and writing team fails to shock or scare with a color-by-numbers plot and a meandering, languid wannabe frightfest.\"\n\nQuestion: In the story described, which location became the present-day boarding school where the final confrontation with the demon Valak takes place?\nChoice list: \nA.

Leo V is the only Byzantine emperor to be nicknamed \"Armenian\" by Byzantine chroniclers.\n\n<image>This now-destroyed mosaic of Gregory the Illuminator, Armenia's patron saint, in Hagia Sophia, Constantinople may had been created next to the Church Fathers in support of the myth of the Arsacid origin of Basil I, likely fabricated by Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople.\n\n<image>This 7th century obelisk in Oshakan, Armenia is attributed by a local tradition to emperor Maurice or his mother.\nAccording to medieval and modern sources, a number of Byzantine emperors were allegedly Armenian or of partially Armenian heritage. The following list includes the Byzantine emperors to whom sources attribute Armenian origin. Speculation of Armenian ancestry in emperors remains a wide topic of debate.\n\n## History and criticism  \nThe first work on Byzantine emperors of Armenian origin, Armenian Emperors of Byzantium (Հայ կայսերք Բիւզանդիոնի), was authored by Fr. Garabed Der-Sahagian and published in 1905 by the Mekhitarist congregation of San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice. Anthony Kaldellis suggested that Der-Sahagian extended \"western European modes of racial and nationalist historiography to the history of medieval Armenia.\" Kaldellis believes that it was Nicholas Adontz who \"made the search for Armenians in Byzantium into a more scholarly and less romantic nationalist process.\" However, he is critical of Adontz as he saw \"Armenians everywhere and injected them into as many important events as he could.\" According to Kaldellis it was later endorsed by Peter Charanis and Alexander Kazhdan and \"has spread widely in the field of Byzantine Studies.\" Kazhdan's book Armenians in the Ruling Class of the Byzantine Empire in the 11th-12th Centuries was published by the Armenian Academy of Sciences in Russian in 1975.  \nCharanis suggested that \"every emperor who sat on the Byzantine throne from the accession of Basil I to the death of Basil II (867—1025) was of Armenian or partially Armenian origin.\" However, he noted that \"in Byzantium the ethnic origins of a person was of not significance, provided he integrated himself into its cultural life.\" Robert H. Hewsen counted \"no fewer than sixteen emperors and eleven empresses\" of Byzantium of Armenian origin and suggested that Armenians ruled \"for almost a third of the empire's history.\" He conceded, however, that \"most of these Armenians, of course, were thoroughly hellenized, membership in the Greek Church being the sine qua non for advancement in the Byzantine world.\"  \nAnthony Kaldellis is highly critical of what he calls the \"Armenian fallacy\" in Byzantine studies to which he dedicated a separate chapter (Armenian fallacy) and a sub-chapter specifically about emperors (Armenian' emperors) in his 2019 book Romanland: Ethnicity and Empire in Byzantium, published by Harvard University Press. He wrote:  \nEven earlier, in 2008, Kaldellis wrote in a publication for Oxford University Press:  \nKaldellis' criticisms of the \"Armenian fallacy\" have been subsequently praised and supported by historians such as Johannes Preiser-Kapeller, Alexander Beihammer, Marek Klatý, and C.J. Meynell, among others.  \n## List\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a figure that is directly associated with the Byzantine Empire?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Storage pest  \nA storage pest is an insect or other animal that damages or destroys stored food or other stored valuable organic matter. Insects are a large proportion of storage pests with each type of crop having specific insects that gravitate towards them such as the genus Tribolium that consists of insects such as Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle) or Tribolium confusum (confused flour beetle) which damage flour crops primarily.  \n## Insects  \nCrops can be completely destroyed or even partially damaged affecting the quality of the crop and the ability to germinate new ones, by decreasing the protein content and removing the seeds from the grains.  \n### Types of insect pests  \n<image>Lesser grain borer\nThere are two types of grain insect pests, primary and secondary pests.\n\n#### Primary pests  \nPrimary grain pests attack the whole grain. The eggs are laid inside the grain, before the larvae mature inside the grain and then chew their way out. Some of these pests include the Lesser grain borer, Granary weevil (Sitophilus granarius, the Wheat weevil) and Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae).  \n##### Lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica) Lesser grain borer  \nThe lesser grain borer has a dark coloured cylindrical structure with the head concealed. When lesser grain borer eggs are laid, they are laid outside the grain, however they mature inside the shell of the seed which can take up to 6 weeks if the temperature is cooler, with the adult borers not living for longer than two months. This species is known to damage stored wheat, maize/corn and other cereal crops with the seeds becoming hollowed out husks. Products with small infestations should be discarded however the grains can be treated with smaller amounts of spray. However, large infestations require more control, including complete fumigation.  \n<image>Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae).\n\n\n##### Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae)  \nThe adult rice weevil has an orange-black exoskeleton and lays up to 450 eggs in pores of the damaged grains with each hatched egg further damaging the grain from the inside. Similarly to the lesser grain borer, maturation also happens inside the grain with the matured adult rice weevil eating through the husk of the grain to get out. The life cycle is similar to that of the lesser grain borer in summer months (approximately one month) and adult weevils live up to 8 months after the experience their life cycle.  \n<image>Rust-red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum).\n\n\n#### Secondary pests  \nSecondary grain insects feed on broken grain and any powder products left as a result of the broken grain. These pests include the genus Tribolium, beetle species and moth species.  \n##### Rust-red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) Rust-red flour beetleTribolium castaneum  \nThe Red flour beetle or Rust-red flour beetle is a red-brown beetle with an exoskeleton that darkens in colour as the beetle increases in age, with the maximum adult age being a year. Unlike primary pests, Rust-red flour beetles can produce up to 1000 eggs and lay them inside the damaged grain with parts of the larvae able to use the damaged grains and cereal as their food source.  \nWarehouse moth (Ephestia elutella).  \n##### Warehouse moth (Ephestia elutella) Ephestia elutella  \nThe Warehouse moth is a grey moth that remains on the surface of the grain with the female moth laying up to 200 eggs, however their life span is only 2 weeks long with a 4 week life cycle. Similarly to other secondary pests, the Warehouse moth eggs use the surface of the grain, although when the larvae hatch they leave a stream of silk that encapsulates the surface of the grain which can then be used as a cocoon for mature larvae.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following insects is known as a primary pest of stored grain products?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Abdel Fattah al-Burhan  \nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan Abdelrahman al-Burhan (ʿAbd al-Fattāḥ al-Burhān ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Burhān; born 1961) is a Sudanese army general who is the de facto ruler of Sudan. Following the Sudanese Revolution in April 2019, he was handed control of the military junta, the Transitional Military Council, a day after it was formed, due to protesters' dissatisfaction with the establishment ties of initial leader Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf. He served as chairman of the TMC until a draft constitutional declaration signed with civilians went into effect in August 2019, and a collective head of state Transitional Sovereignty Council was formed, also to be initially headed by al-Burhan.  \nThe 2020 Juba Agreement allowed al-Burhan to continue to lead the Sovereignty Council for another 20 months, rather than stepping down as planned in February 2021. Al-Burhan seized power in a coup d'état in October 2021, dissolved the Sovereignty Council, and reconstituted it the following month with new membership, keeping himself as chairman.  He was formerly the General Inspector of the Sudanese Armed Forces.  \n## Early life and education  \nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan was born in 1961 in the village of Gandatu in northern Sudan, to a Sufi family. Al-Burhan studied elementary and intermediate level in his village school, and later moved to Shendi to complete his education before joining the Sudanese Military College among the 31st batch.  \n## Military career  \nAfter graduating from the Military Academy, al-Burhan worked in Khartoum, as part of the Sudanese army, and participated in the fighting fronts in the Darfur war and in the Second Sudanese Civil War in South Sudan and other regions. He was regional commander in Darfur. He later traveled to Egypt and then to Jordan to receive training courses in his military field until in 2018 he was appointed commander of the ground forces of the army.  \nAl-Burhan held several positions throughout his career as he began as a soldier with the Border Guard Forces and later became commander of this force before becoming Deputy Chief of Staff of the Ground Forces Operations and then Chief of Staff of the Sudanese Army in February 2018 before he served as Inspector General of the Army for a period of time. By 26 February 2019, during the massive protests that swept the country and demanded the fall of Omar al-Bashir's regime, al-Burhan was elevated to the rank of lieutenant general.  \n## Chairman of the Transitional Military Council (2019)  \n<image>Al-Burhan with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in October 2019\n\n<image>Al-Burhan with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Russia–Africa Summit in Sochi on 23 October 2019\n\n<image>Al-Burhan with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in August 2020\nShortly after his appointment, al-Burhan ordered the release of all jailed prisoners who had been arrested by his predecessor, Omar al-Bashir, in a televised address.\n\n### Khartoum massacre  \nIn early June 2019, following al-Burhan's and Hemedti's visits to the Egyptian, UAE and Saudi leaders, the Sudanese Security Forces and Rapid Support Forces, including Janjaweed militias, led by al-Burhan and his deputy cracked down on peaceful protests in Sudan, starting with the 3 June Khartoum massacre. Human rights groups said that peaceful protesters were killed and about forty of the bodies were thrown in the river Nile, hundreds were tortured, violated and raped in the streets of Khartoum.  \nAl-Burhan's talks with the opposition on forming a combined government were then cancelled. During the days that followed, the TMC arrested several of the opposition leaders.  \nIyad el-Baghdadi interpreted the decision-making by the TMC under al-Burhan's leadership as being strongly influenced by the general context of the Saudi, UAE and Egyptian leaders being afraid of democratic movements. Mahmoud Elmutasim, a political activist and doctor who graduated from the University of Khartoum, similarly stated that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are opposed to the existence of democracies in the Middle East, since if \"the idea of democracy itself should ever take root, or become widespread in the Middle East,\" then it would constitute a threat to the governmental systems of Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  \n### Internet shutdown  \nSeveral human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the al-Burhan-led TMC for shutting down the internet in June 2019. A spokesperson, Shamseldin Kabbashi, stated that the internet would be shut down for a long time because it represented a threat to national security. The move was described by HRW as a \"gross violation of human rights\". International media saw this as a sign of dictatorship and condemned the act. Many see it as an attempt to hide what al-Burhan's allied militia, known as the Janjaweed, were doing in Khartoum and  \nto delay uploading evidence of the violations that took place on 3 June 2019 and in the days that followed.  \n### Civilian government negotiations  \nIn May 2019, al-Burhan's first international trip was to Egypt to meet Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. His second visit was to the United Arab Emirates, where he met with the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Iyad el-Baghdadi, a human rights activist who became famous during the Arab Spring, later interpreted these visits (together with a visit by TMC deputy leader Hemedti to Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia) as encouragements for the TMC to cancel negotiations with the opposition. This comment by Iyad el-Baghdadi and recent developments and his ties to the Egyptian brotherhood which he established long ago when he studied in Egypt has led to the popular belief that al-Burhan has no interest to lead Sudan to a democratic and civilian state. Despite his promise to establish a civilian government by February 2021 as demanded by numerous protesters, his group seems to consistently isolate the civilian government led by Hamdok in key government decisions.  \nNumerous protesters asked for a civilian government. On Saturday 13 April 2019, al-Burhan announced that a civilian government would soon be established. Al-Burhan promised that the transitional period would take a maximum of two years. Negotiations started to take place with the opposition leaders to achieve this.  \n## Chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council (2021-present)  \n<image>Al-Burhan with Israel's Minister of Intelligence, Eli Cohen, in January 2021\nOn 25 October 2021, al-Burhan led the October 2021 Sudanese coup d'état to overthrow the civilian government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. On 21 November 2021, all political prisoners were freed and Abdalla Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister as part of an agreement with the civilian political parties. Hamdok was also allowed to return leading the transitional government.  \nOn 4 December 2021, al-Burhan told Reuters in an interview that the Sudanese military will \"exit politics\" following the elections scheduled for July 2023, stating, \"When a government is elected, I don't think the army, the armed forces, or any of the security forces will participate in politics. This is what we agreed on and this is the natural situation.\"  \nOn 9 December 2021, al-Burhan warned of possible measures against foreign diplomatic missions for their alleged incitement against the Sudanese army. He also reiterated his commitment to the political agreement struck with Prime Minister Hamdok in November 2021. On December 20 2021, al-Burhan voiced his support for Hamdok, adding that recent appointments had been made as the result of co-ordination between him and the prime minister and in line with the November 21st 2021 political agreement.  \nOn 31 December 2021, in a speech, al-Burhan said he was committed to \"building all the institutions of transitional government and holding free, fair, and transparent elections at their scheduled time\", in July 2023.  \nBoth al-Burhan and Hemedti had ties to Vladimir Putin's regime in Russia. According to Business Insider, \"The two generals helped Russian President Vladimir Putin exploit Sudan's gold resources to help buttress Russian finances against Western sanctions and fund his war in Ukraine.\" On 9 February 2023, al-Burhan met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.  \nOn 2 January 2022 Abdalla Hamdok resigned from his post of prime minister and Osman Hussein was sworn in as acting prime minister.  \nOn 4 July 2022, it was reported that al-Burhan mentioned the army will withdraw from the ongoing political talks and will allow political and revolutionary groups to form a transitional civilian government. This statement followed recent pro-democracy protests where 117 people were killed.\n\n### 2023 Sudan conflict  \nOn April 15, 2023, the country's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched attacks against al-Burhan's government, claiming to capture key government sites. Al-Burhan has claimed these sites are still under the control of his forces, and fighting is ongoing. As of 21 April, the clashes have continued, although with occasional ceasefires.  \nThe Sudanese military received support from Egypt. Egypt had sent soldiers and warplanes to Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The other rival, Rapid Support Forces had received support from Libya and United Arab Emirates as well as Russia's Wagner Group. The foreign involvement in the regional war could have a devastating effect on Sudan.\n\nQuestion: Which image shows Al-Burhan meeting with a US official?\nChoice list: \nA.

He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Christ Church, Oxford, before he embarked on a short-lived career as a schoolmaster.

As a result, he was briefly arrested before being granted official accreditation as a war correspondent. His reportage for the remainder of the war received national recognition, despite being criticised by some and parodied by soldiers. His book With the British on the Somme (1917) portrayed the English soldier in a very favourable light. Both France and Britain rewarded him with knighthoods after the war, but Thomas regretted some of his wartime output.  \nThomas's primary interest as an adult was in rural matters. He was conservative in his views and after the Second World War feared that the Labour government regarded the countryside only from an economic perspective. He was an advocate for the creation of national parks in England and Wales and mourned the decline of traditional village society. He wrote extensively, particularly for The Observer newspaper and The Spectator, a conservative magazine. His book The English Landscape (1938) included selections from his contributions to Country Life magazine.\n\n## Childhood and education  \nWilliam Beach Thomas was born on 22 May 1868 in Godmanchester, in the county of Huntingdonshire, England. He was the second son of Daniel George Thomas and his wife, Rosa Beart. In 1872, his father was appointed rector of Hamerton and the countryside location of that parish inspired an affection in Beach Thomas which greatly influenced his later observational writings about natural history and rural subjects. Beach Thomas was not a hyphenated double-barrelled name; he used his middle name, Beach, as part of his name as a writer, and in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography his name is \"Thomas, William Beach\".ODNB  \nThomas attended Shrewsbury School from 1882.ps=none He was a keen sportsman there and was appointed huntsman to the Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt, the world's oldest cross-country running club.Times1957 He continued his interest in sports after earning an exhibition to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1887 and became a blue, representing the university in various running events over several years. He became president of the Oxford University Athletics Club and played association football, rugby union, and cricket at college level.ODNB J. B. Atkins, who competed against him for the University of Cambridge athletics team, said: \"With his stately height and gigantic stride, he was magnificent in action; his final effort, always, triumphant, when he saw the goal of all, the tape, waiting for him, was a sight never to be forgotten – though I had a strong reason for regretting it at the time.\"Atkins1960 His exhibition was superseded by a scholarship but he was not academically successful, managing only a third-class degree.ODNB  \n## Early career  \nAthletic prowess and the time spent in achieving it may have contributed to Thomas's poor academic performance, but probably also assisted him in getting his first job.Musty1985 He taught at Bradfield College, a public school, after leaving Oxford in 1891. Although he described teaching as \"uncongenial\", he subsequently took a similar position at Dulwich College in 1897, where he remained until the following year. Journalism became the object of his interest; he contributed columns for The Globe, The Outlook and The Saturday Review, as well as for many other publications of which he was not a member of staff. He also wrote a book entitled Athletics, published by Ward Lock & Co in 1901, following his contribution of a chapter titled \"Athletics and Schools\" to the Athletics volume in the Badminton Library series, published by Longman, Green & Co in 1900 and edited by Montague Shearman.Musty1985 He became a regular reviewer for The Times Literary Supplement from its formation in 1902.Times1957  \nThe Daily Mail took on Thomas as a writer of material relating to the countryside. Lord Northcliffe, who owned the newspaper, recognised that Thomas needed to live in a rural environment if he was to perform his duties well. This understanding delighted Thomas, because it meant he could limit his visits to London. He moved to the Mimram Valley in Hertfordshire, and thereafter held Northcliffe in high regard.ODNB Thomas reported on the 78th meeting of the British Association in Dublin in 1908.  \nThomas's From a Hertfordshire Cottage was published in 1908, followed by a three-volume collaboration with A. K. Collett, The English Year (1913–14).ODNB He did not entirely abandon his interest in athletics and was one of those in Britain who criticised his country's poor performance in the 1912 Olympic Games. Writing that the Olympics were by then being seen as a measure of \"national vitality\", he explained  \n## War correspondent  \n<image>F. E. Smith, and demanded that all reports be channelled through the bureau, for review by censors; the resulting output was bland and impersonal.ps=none The newspapers countered with subterfuge. Thomas was one of several journalists who managed to reach the front lines in Belgium. He was discovered there and imprisoned for some time by the British Army.ps=none He described the episode as \"the longest walking tour of my life, and the queerest\". Even these early unapproved reports, which consisted mostly of human interest stories because there was little opportunity for contact with the British Expeditionary Force, were censored at home owing to a paradox that Thomas described: \"the censors would not publish any article if it indicated that the writer had seen what he wrote of. He must write what he thought was true, not what he knew to be true.\"Farish\nWhen the British government relented in mid-1915, having been warned by Theodore Roosevelt that the reporting limitations were affecting public opinion in the United States,ps=none Valentine Williams became the Daily Mails first accredited war correspondent. No longer in prison, Thomas resumed his war reporting in December of the same year, when Williams enlisted in the Irish Guards.Farish As with the other accredited journalists, Thomas was paid by the War Office rather than by his newspaper, and all the correspondents were assured that they would be able to publish memoirs of their service to offset the differential between an officer's pay and that of a journalist.SmithHiggins Thomas filed reports from places such as the Somme in a format matching that of his colleagues, who regularly played down the unpleasant aspects of the conflict, such as the nature of death.ps=none His reports were published in the Daily Mirror as well as the Daily Mail.SmithHiggins  \nThe soldiers derided the attempts that were made to indoctrinate them, but the British public was more susceptible. Philip Gibbs, a fellow war correspondent, noted that he and his colleagues \"identified absolutely with the Armies in the field ... There was no need of censorship in our despatches. We were our own censors.\"ps=none The journalistic support for the cause was appreciated by military commanders such as Douglas Haig, who saw the propaganda generated by the correspondents as an integral part of the Allies' efforts. Haig eventually went so far as to ask Gibbs and Thomas to produce his own weekly news-sheet.ps=none Public opinion at home may have been mollified, even uplifted, by the efforts of the correspondents, but the morale of the troops was not, despite the high demand among them for newspapers from home. One soldier, Albert Rochester, was court martialled for attempting to send to the Daily Mail a letter that stated the realities as he saw them and was critical of Thomas's work, noting the \"ridiculous reports regarding the love and fellowship existing between officers and men\". Thomas himself later regretted his wartime reports from the Somme, saying, \"I was thoroughly and deeply ashamed of what I had written for the good reason that it was untrue ... the vulgarity of enormous headlines and the enormity of one's own name did not lessen the shame.\"ps=none\n<image>alt=A black-and-white photograph of a First World War tank.\nNorthcliffe's brother, Lord Rothermere, expressed frustration with the war correspondents: \"They don't know the truth, they don't speak the truth, and we know that they don't.\" Stephen Badsey, a historian who specialises in the First World War, has noted that their situation was not easy as they \"found themselves as minor players trapped in a complicated hierarchical structure dominated by politicians, generals and newspaper owners\".ps=none Thomas received particular opprobrium. Paul Fussell, the historian, describes him as \"notoriously fatuous\" during the war period.ps=none Peter Stothard, editor of The Times between 1992 and 2002, describes him as \"a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous Daily Mail war correspondent\" and believes that he may have been the inspiration for the character of William Boot in Evelyn Waugh's novel Scoop.ps=none John Simpson, a war correspondent, describes Thomas as \"charming but unlovable\"ps=none and thinks that the soldiers despised him more than they did the other British war correspondents, even though all those journalists were playing a similar disinformation role. They considered his writing to be a trivialisation of the realities of war, jingoistic, pompous and particularly self-promoting, often giving the reader an impression that he was writing from the battlefield when in fact he was being fed information of dubious value by the military authorities while based in their headquarters.SmithHiggins  \nAn example of Thomas's reporting is as follows:  \nThomas's style was parodied using the by-line of Teech Bomasps=none in the Wipers Times, a trench newspaper, but he was lauded by the readers back in Britain. One example from the Wipers Times, based on a report published in the Daily Mail of 18 September 1916,ps=none reads:\n<image>alt=A black-and-white photograph showing a uniformed man on the left who is stooping slightly forward as he holds the hand of a man on the right, who is the king. Also in the photograph are many other uniformed men, forming a group mostly behind the two main subjects. A woman wearing a feathered hat stands to the left side of the king.\nIn 1918, William Beach Thomas published a book based on his wartime experiences, entitled With the British on the Somme. It was a favourable depiction specifically of the English soldier, somewhat contrary to the official line that tried to emphasise that this was a British war rather than an English one. A review in The Times Literary Supplement noted that Thomas  \nIn 1918, Northcliffe asked Thomas to travel to the US. According to Thomas, the rationale for the trip was that \"he didn't know what the Americans were doing, and they did not know what we were thinking\". He met with influential people such as Henry Ford, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson during this visit.ps=none  \nWilliam Beach Thomas sometimes accompanied King George V and the Prince of Wales on their visits to France, noting on one occasion a situation he considered reminiscent of Henry II and Thomas Becket:  \nThomas's war work led to official recognition, as it did for many of the correspondents and newspaper owners; France made him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920.ODNB In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE, which he too received: \"I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from it so much that I entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency.\" This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.ps=none\n\n## Later years  \nAfter the war, Thomas stayed in Germany until 1919 and returned there in 1923 at the time of the Occupation of the Ruhr. He also undertook a tour of the world for the Daily Mail and The Times in 1922. His main focus returned to his lifelong interest in matters of the countryside, notably in his writings for The Observer from 1923 to 1956.ODNB Thomas was also a regular contributor of notes on nature, gardening and country life to The Spectator for almost thirty years, with some short breaks between 1935 and 1941, when H. E. Bates took over responsibility.ps=noneSpectator1957 In 1928 Thomas produced a history of the magazine under the title of The Story of the 'Spectator, in commemoration of its centenary.Times1957 He wrote many more books and articles in his later years, as well as two autobiographical books: A Traveller in News (1925) and The Way of a Countryman (1944).ODNB Fond of peppering quotations throughout his writing,Musty1985 his style was considered to be clear but his hand was poor; a profile of him in The Observer said \"perhaps he gave less pleasure to those who had to decipher his handwriting. Rarely has more limpid English been conveyed in a script more obscure.\"Observer1956  \nGeorge Orwell wrote in the Manchester Evening News:  \nEven as traditional English village life was in collapse, Thomas saw the romanticised paternalism and general life of the village as the epitome of English society and equivalent to anything that might be found elsewhere in the world. He said that one of the aspects of village life he admired was that \"comparative wealth there is admired, not envied\".ps=none He also viewed the natural world as something to be wondered at rather than scientifically examined. In his last column for The Spectator, written in September 1950, he wrote:  \nIn his desire to encourage a love of the countryside, especially during the Second World War, William Beach Thomas was similar to other writers on rural matters, such as G. M. Trevelyan and H. J. Massingham.ps=none He described Massingham as \"perhaps the best of all present writers on Rural England\" and considered him among those writers who were \"so fond of the past that they seem sometimes almost to despair of the future\".Musty1985 Malcolm Chase, a historian, says that these authors, including Thomas himself, advocated an ultra-conservative, socially reactionary and idealistic philosophy that formed an important part of a national debate about the future of the land and agriculture. This attitude was coupled with an increasing public interest in pastimes such as cycling, motoring and walking; it was supported by the publication of popular, fairly cheap and colourful articles, books and maps that catered both to those pursuing such interests and those who were concerned about conservation and the effects of the influx of urban and suburban visitors.ps=none John Musty, in his comparative literary review of the works of Thomas and Massingham, believes that Thomas had a more \"gentle touch\" than Massingham, whose writings have \"frequently been judged as narrow and reactionary\"; he quotes Thomas as saying of the likes of Massingham that they \"preach an impossible creed, albeit an attractive one\".Musty1985  \n<image>alt=Colour photograph\nMuch of one of Thomas's books, The English Landscape (1938), had previously appeared in various issues of Country Life magazine, and in part echoed concerns raised by Clough Williams-Ellis in works such as his England and the Octopus (1928). Williams-Ellis believed that building on greenfield land was too great a price to pay for socio-economic progress. Thomas argued in favour of protecting open spaces by creating national parks, for which he thought that the coastline would be the most suitable candidate. He stressed the relationship between the people and the land and saw a need for planning control to manage human ingress into areas that remained mostly untouched.ps=none  In 1934 he supported the Nature Lovers Association in its appeal to make the mountainous Snowdonia region, near the coast of North Wales, such an entity.NEP1934 He also supported the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society.WDP1934  \nIn 1931 Thomas lamented the inability of the National Farmers Union of England and Wales to hold up what he saw as the decline of the farming industry.WG1933 In A Countryman's Creed (1946) he harked back to a lost world, perhaps even a world that was more of his imagination than it was ever real. As F. R. Leavis had done before him, Thomas sought a rural revival to curtail what he saw as the rapid changes to traditional ways of life that had been evident in particular in the aftermath of the First World War and which were now ideologically challenged following the substantial victory of the socialist Labour Party in the 1945 general election. The new government was a threat to Thomas's view of the world because, in the words of the literary critic Robert Hemmings, it saw the countryside \"as merely a giant dairy and granary for the city\".ps=none  \nThomas was opposed to the use of the toothed steel trap for catching rabbits, supporting the RSPCA in its efforts to outlaw the device and noting that it inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals, such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.NDJ1933\n\n## Personal life and death  \nWilliam Beach Thomas married Helen Dorothea Harcourt, a daughter of Augustus George Vernon Harcourt, in April 1900, and with her had three sons and a daughter. Their second son, Michael Beach Thomas, was killed in 1941 while serving as a naval officer during the Second World War.ODNB Helen survived her husband, who died on 12 May 1957 at their home, \"High Trees\", Gustardwood, Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire.ODNB He was buried in the village churchyard at St Helen's Church.ps=none Among the obituaries of William Beach Thomas were those published in NaturePitt1957 and The Times.Times1957  \n## Books  \nAside from his journalism, Thomas wrote and contributed to many books, all published in London and some also in New York.

Prior to statehood, there were 41,000 enslaved African-Americans in the Province of North Carolina in 1767.  By 1860, the number of slaves in the state of North Carolina was 331,059, about one third of the total population of the state.  In 1860, there were nineteen counties in North Carolina where the number of slaves was larger than the free white population.  During the antebellum period the state of North Carolina passed several laws to protect the rights of slave owners while disenfranchising the rights of slaves.  There was a constant fear amongst white slave owners in North Carolina of slave revolts from the time of the American Revolution.  Despite their circumstances, some North Carolina slaves and freed slaves distinguished themselves as artisans, soldiers during the Revolution, religious leaders, and writers.\n\n## Growth of the slave population in North Carolina  \nThe Lord Proprietors encouraged importing of slaves to the Province of North Carolina by instituting a headright system that gave settlers acreage for the number of slaves that they brought to the province. The geography was a factor that slowed the importation of slaves.  Settlers imported slaves from Virginia or South Carolina because of the poor harbors and treacherous coastline.  The enslaved black population grew from 800 in 1712 to 6,000 in 1730 and about 41,000 in 1767.  \nIn the early years, the line between white indentured servants and African laborers was vague, as some Africans also arrived under an indenture, before more were transported as slaves. Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong racial caste. Most of the free colored families found in North Carolina in the censuses of 1790–1810 were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men in colonial Virginia. Because the mothers were free, their children were born free. Such mixed-race families migrated along with their European-American neighbors into the frontier of North Carolina. As the flow of indentured laborers slackened because of improving economic conditions in Britain, the colony was short on labor and imported more slaves. It followed Virginia in increasing its controls on slavery, which became a racial caste of the foreign Africans.  \nThe economy's growth and prosperity were based on slave labor, devoted first to the production of tobacco. The oppressive and brutal experiences of slaves and poor whites led to their using escape, violent resistance, and theft of food and other goods in order to survive.  \nPercent of population that was slave by county in North Carolina in 1860  \nThe number of slaves in North Carolina increased from 100,783 in 1790 to 351,059 in 1860.  The percentage of population that was slaves varied by county.  There were 19 counties in 1860 where the slave population was greater than the free white population in 1860.  These counties were in agricultural areas producing cotton, tobacco, rice and naval stores and where larger plantations and farms existed in the coastal plains, Piedmont, and counties bordering Virginia.  There were more slaves in both Virginia and South Carolina in 1860.  The Appalachian mountain counties had a lower percentage of slaves.  The number of slaves in the western North Carolina counties (Davidson, Washington, Tennessee, Sullivan) that became part of Tennessee in 1796 had relatively few slaves.  \nU.S. Slave Population Percentage of Total Population by County in 1860  \n## Slave owners  \nEnslaved people labored in a variety of roles. Men, women, and children worked variously as domestic servants, skilled artisans, field laborers, and more in urban settings and on both small farms and large plantations.  Plantations are often defined as large land holdings that produced cash crops beyond subsistence requirements. Alternatively, some scholars distinguish a plantation from a farm based on the number of people enslaved by the property owner. The number of slaves on a plantation would vary from tens to over one thousand at larger plantations.  Early 1900 efforts to document the number of plantations in North Carolina indicate that there were at least 328 plantations in the state.  \nSlaves were personal property of their owners and could be sold at the discretion of the owner.  Slaves were also conveyed in personal wills of the slave master to heirs.  Through records of slave auctions and estate records, the value of slaves were recorded.  The value of a slave depended on the gender and age with able bodied male slaves, especially skilled artisans, being the highest.  The value of a slave was between £60 and £80 at the time of the French and Indian War (17541763).  The value of a slave increased to about £180 in 1780 and to about $800 in 1840.  At the onset of the Civil War, the value of an enslaved male field hand was $1,500 to $1,700; the average value of an enslaved woman ranged from $1,300 to $1,500; an enslaved artisan with specialized skills was valued at as much as $2,000.  \n## Legal status of enslaved in North Carolina  \nBelow is a list of dates of laws and events that were relevant to slaves in North Carolina.  The full referencing can be found in the linked articles.  \n* 1669, Article 10 of the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina stated, \"Every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves, of what opinion or religion soever\"  \n* 1739, The Stono Rebellion was a slave rebellion that began on 9 September 1739, in the colony of South Carolina.  Due to the proximity to North Carolina, this rebellion caused North Carolina slave owners to restrict their slaves ability to carry guns.  \n* 1741, a law of the North Carolina Provincial Congress forbade the manumission of slaves except as a reward for outstanding, or meritorious, service to the state.  County courts could determine this reward and if granted the slave was required to leave the state within six months.  \n* 1774, the North Carolina Provincial Congress passed a law, \"that we will not import any slave or slaves, or purchase any slave or slaves, imported or brought into this Province by others, from any part of the world.\"  \n* 17751783, Black men from North Carolina fought for both sides in the American Revolution.  \n* 1776, the Constitution of North Carolina allowed freed slaves the right to vote  \n* 1791, The Haitian Revolution was an uprising of slaves in Haiti, which caused North Carolina to restrict the influx of Caribbean slaves  \n* 1793, The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was an act of the U.S. Congress that guaranteed a right for a slaveholder to recover an escaped slave  \n* 1808, the U.S. Congress passed a law prohibiting the engagement in international slave trade.  \n* 1816, the North Carolina General Assembly passed an \"Act to Dispose of Illegally Imported Slaves\".  The proceeds of the sale of illegal slaves was paid to the North Carolina Treasury.  \n* 1816, the North Carolina Manumission Society was formed.  It included Quakers and other anti-slavery groups.  \n* 1819, The Panic of 1819 caused many slave owners to sell their slaves due to worsening economic conditions. Many farmers decided to abandon their farms and head to western states or to Texas Territory to make a new start.  \n* 1835, the North Carolina Constitution was amended to take away the right of freed slaves to vote  \n* 1860, the North Carolina General Assembly had a higher percentage (85) of politicians owning slaves than any statehouse in the country.  \n* 1863, January 1, Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln changed the status of enslaved African Americans from slave to free in North Carolina and other Confederate States of America  \n* 1865, Slavery abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, excluding convicted criminals. It affects 40,000 remaining slaves.  \n## Slave religions  \nThe religion amongst enslaved people was diverse.  Some twenty to thirty percent of slaves that came to America were Muslim.  A few had heard of Christianity but many followed traditional African religions.  \nDuring the 1700s, most enslaved people held on to their native religions and customs from Africa.  However, by the early 1800s, enslaved people were converting to Protestant religions—most notably Baptist and Methodist.  Some white churches had balconies where enslaved people were allowed to attend services with their masters.  Fear of revolts did not allow enslaved people to organize churches until after the Civil War.  \n## Notable slaves and freed slaves  \n<image>Harriet Jacobs\n\n<image>Abraham Galloway\n\n<image>Lunsford Lane\n\n<image>Omar ibn Said\n* John Chavis was a free black educator and Presbyterian minister in the American South during the early 19th century. Born in Oxford, North Carolina, he fought for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He was the first African American to graduate from college.  He studied with John Witherspoon at the College of New Jersey and finished his studies at Liberty Hall Academy in Virginia, where he was licensed to preach. Later while working in Raleigh, North Carolina, he established a private school that was highly regarded and attended by both white and black students.)  \n* Thomas Peters, Enslaved in the Province of North Carolina, Peters emancipated himself and joined British forces during the American Revolutionary War. He served as a Black Loyalist in the Black Company of Pioneers in New York and was evacuated with British forces and many other former slaves at the end of the war. Thomas Peters has been called the \"first African-American hero\". Like Elijah Johnson and Joseph Jenkins Roberts of Liberia, Peters is considered the African-American founding father of a nation, in this case, Sierra Leone.  \n* Jonathan Overton was a black soldier from North Carolina who served under George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown.  \n* Ned Griffin was a slave who served in the American Revolution for his owner William Kitchen.  The North Carolina General Assembly freed him and gave him the right to vote, even though William Kitchen had refused.  \n* Slave James of Perquimans County, North Carolina, served as a sailor on a Continental ship. He was captured twice by the British.  After the war, he was freed by the Perquimans county court.  \n* George Moses Horton, \"the black bard of Chapel Hill\", was the first North Carolinian, enslaved or free, to publish a book of literature.  \n* Harriet Ann Jacobs was an African-American writer who escaped from slavery in Edenton, North Carolina, and was later freed.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Alasdair Macintosh Geddes  \nAlasdair Macintosh Geddes CBE (born May 1934) is Emeritus Professor of Infection at the University of Birmingham Medical School. In 1978, as the World Health Organization (WHO) was shortly to announce that the world's last case of smallpox had occurred a year earlier in Somalia, Geddes diagnosed a British woman with the disease in Birmingham, England. She was found to be the index case of the outbreak and became the world's last reported fatality due to the disease, five years after he had gained experience on the frontline of the WHO's smallpox eradication programme in Bangladesh in 1973.  \nHis early research included work on drug discovery and antibiotics, and the definitions and management of bacterial meningitis and pneumococcal disease. In 1975, he became Chairman of the first editorial board of the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. In the same year he was co-editor of the best seller book titled Control of Hospital Infection, later known as Ayliffe's Control of Healthcare-Associated Infection: A Practical Handbook.  \nFollowing the September 11 attacks, Geddes became an adviser on bioterrorism for the UK's Department of Health, his chief role being in the national smallpox plan and in biodefence training.  \nIn 2015, he retired from his position as Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, having served the journal for the previous 10 years.  \nHis recollections of smallpox in Birmingham inspired Mark Pallen to write The Last Days of Smallpox: Tragedy in Birmingham, published in 2018.  \n## Early life and education  \nAlasdair Geddes was born in Fortrose, near Inverness, Scotland, in May 1934, to Angus and Isabella Geddes. His early education was at the Fortrose Academy, the local school.  \nEdinburgh Medical School  \nIn 1957 he graduated in medicine from the University of Edinburgh, where his interest in antibiotics later originated.  \n## Medical career  \nHe completed his early medical posts at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh and then in Perth, following which he spent two years completing National Service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and rose to the rank of captain. Subsequently, he gained experience in infectious diseases and general medicine first at Edinburgh and then as a medical registrar at Aberdeen and began research on antibiotics, with publications in the British Medical Journal and The Lancet. After a visit to the United States, he returned to Britain and took up a post as one of two consultants in infectious diseases at the East Birmingham (now Heartlands) Hospital in May 1967, at the same time as the local smallpox hospital, Witton Isolation Hospital, was deemed unnecessary and therefore demolished by fire. Geddes, at the time, settled in Solihull.  \nHe later recounted that when \"I told my friends in Edinburgh that I was going to work in infectious diseases, they thought I was a bit stupid. They said you’re mad, infectious diseases are disappearing, we have antibiotics and vaccines, why don't you do something more interesting!\"  \n### Bangladesh (1973)  \nIn 1973, the Department of Health assigned Geddes as a visiting fellow with the World Health Organization (WHO) smallpox eradication effort in Bangladesh, where he spent seven weeks under the leadership of Nick Ward, travelling through villages and gaining frontline experience in smallpox vaccination. He later recalled \"I saw many cases of smallpox.\"  \nIn October 1973, as a consequence of the oil crisis, he was called to return to England. In the same year, he was designated Birmingham's smallpox consultant. The following year, in an article in the British Medical Journal, he described signs and symptoms of smallpox and wrote that  \nthe possibility of smallpox should be considered in every patient with unexplained fever who has recently visited the five countries of the world where this disease is still endemic-namely, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Ethiopia. The likelihood of smallpox re-appearing in countries other than these five should always be remembered.  \n### Writing  \nIn 1975, Geddes became Chairman of the first editorial board of the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. In the same year, he co-edited the best-seller Control of Hospital Infection, later known as Ayliffe's Control of Healthcare-Associated Infection: A Practical Handbook. In 1976 L. P. Garrod stated in his review of the book that it made much \"of how to cope with a suspected case of smallpox. As the WHO claims that this disease is on the verge of extinction, even in Bangladesh, may future editions safely omit this?\" Throughout his career, Geddes authored almost 200 scientific publications covering a wide range of infectious disease topics.  \n### Antibiotics  \nHis early research included work on drug discovery and studies on the use of cephaloridine. Pertaining to trials of what became known as Augmentin, a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, he later recalled that “getting the right dose of amoxicillin proved important for efficacy and getting the right dose of clavulanic acid was key to tolerability”. In 1977, he published on the efficacies of cephamycins, including their parenteral administration, dosages and penetrations through normal and inflamed blood–brain barrier. He made comparisons of clindamycin with lincomycin against H. influenzae in vitro, and later demonstrated that clindamycin was active against Coxiella burnetti, the cause of Q fever. Other research has included studies on the antiviral aciclovir.  \n### Birmingham (1978)  \nIn August 1978, five years after returning from Bangladesh, Geddes diagnosed smallpox in Janet Parker, a medical photographer working in the East Wing of the medical school in Birmingham. She had been admitted to Ward 32 at East Birmingham Hospital after being diagnosed with at first chickenpox and then a drug reaction. Several physicians saw her before Geddes was called to the hospital for an opinion. Aware that Parker also worked in a room above the regional smallpox laboratory, he in turn called upon virologist Henry Bedson and both confirmed their suspicions that same day when they examined fluid from Parker's blisters and saw brick-shaped particles under the electron microscope, compatible with smallpox. Until this time, all the call-outs he received for suspected smallpox cases were false-alarms such as erythema multiforme and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. With the WHO about to announce the eradication of smallpox, it was widely thought that the last ever case of smallpox had occurred the previous year, in 1977 in Somalia. Parker later died on 11 September 1978 and became the last reported fatality due to the disease. Later, in an interview in 2004, when asked if Parker's case had any link with the 1966 smallpox outbreak in Birmingham, he replied \"it is probably significant that the initial case in the variola minor outbreak in the West Midlands in 1966 was, like Janet Parker, a photographer in the Birmingham Medical School, where research was being carried out on smallpox viruses.\"  \n### 1980s  \nHe was appointed professor of infectious diseases at Birmingham University in 1982. In chapter seven of the Report of a committee of inquiry into the future development of the Public Health Function, chaired by the then Chief Medical Officer Sir Donald Acheson and presented to parliament in the wake of the 1984 outbreak of Salmonella in Wakefield and the 1985 outbreak of legionellosis at Stafford, Geddes was noted to head a subcommittee to deal with control of communicable disease and infection.  \n### 1990s  \nIn the 1990s, he was involved in tuberculosis (TB) research, leading the University of Birmingham team in the Glaxo Action tuberculosis programme that studied the molecular biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and new ways of delivering medicines into the TB infected cells. By studying how the human immune system responded to TB, Geddes hoped that the results would lead to a new vaccine, more effective than the BCG.  \nIn 1991 he became professor of infection at the University of Birmingham Medical School, where in 1994 he became its Deputy Dean then Associate Dean from 1999 to 2002. He has served as civilian consultant in infectious diseases and tropical medicine to the Royal Navy, Deputy Chairman of the Tropical Diseases Research Board of the UK Medical Research Council, and the Committee on Safety of Medicines and of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.  \n<image>Child with Smallpox, Bangladesh, 1973, the year Geddes was assigned to the WHO smallpox eradication effort in Bangladesh\n\n<image>The rear of the Medical School showing the location of the smallpox laboratory (bottom) and the rooms where Parker worked (above)\n\n<image>The ward block at East Birmingham Hospital, Birmingham UK in 1978.

Differential diagnosis against influenza, chickenpox, Eczema herpeticum, Eczema vaccinatum and drug eruptions/erythema multiforme is necessary. The last smallpox case in Birmingham, UK, caused by a lab infection in 1978, was initially misdiagnosed by 3 physicians, leading to a significant delay in treatment and containment measures. This fact underlines the importance of an appropriate education and training of physicians to diagnose disease caused by bioterroristic agents as part of the preparedness plans.  \nWith smallpox in the media again after 2001, and noting that Parker had previously received two smallpox vaccinations, he became interested in how long immunity lasts in those who have previously been immunised. It led him to study and publish in 2005 an article on the Edinburgh smallpox outbreak of 1942, where six of the 36 cases of smallpox had received previous vaccination. The following year he published \"The history of smallpox\".  \nIn 2015, after 10 years in the post, he retired from his position as Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.  \n## Awards and honours  \nGeddes is a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. From 1996 to 1998 he was president of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. The following year, the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy awarded him the Garrod Medal, following which he delivered its accompanying lecture. In 2009, he received Honorary Membership of the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. He received the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases award for excellence in clinical microbiology and infectious diseases in 2014. Subsequently, in 2015 he received the Hamao Umezawa Memorial Award (HUMA) Award.  \nHis recollections of 1978 inspired Mark Pallen to write The Last Days of Smallpox: Tragedy in Birmingham, published in 2018.  \n## Selected publications  \n* (Joint author)  \n* |volume=11|issue=2|pages=291–297|doi=10.3201/eid1102.040609|issn=1080-6040|pmc=3320452|pmid=15752449|last1=Kerrod|first1=Emma|last2=Geddes|first2=Alasdair M.|last3=Regan|first3=Martyn|last4=Leach|first4=Steve (Joint author)  \n* (Joint author)\n\nQuestion: In which image did Geddes diagnose smallpox in 1978?\nChoice list: \nA.

The project started in 2020.  \n<image>Olena Zelenska at the Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen\nOn August 23, 2021, the First Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen took place in Kyiv at the initiative of Olena Zelenska. Eleven first ladies from different countries joined the event. The main topic of discussion was the post-COVID reality. At the end of the event, the participants approved a joint declaration.  \nThe purpose of the summits is to unite the first ladies and gentlemen for the purpose of creating an international platform to share experience and implement joint projects for the well-being of people in the world; to discuss the current problems and activities of the first ladies and gentlemen to solve them; to make the voice of every first lady and gentleman more influential.\n\n### Activities since the Russian invasion  \nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Zelenska was described as Russia's target number two. In mid-March, she was in Ukraine at an undisclosed location. She released a statement highlighting the names of children killed during the invasion. During the war, her efforts have focused on humanitarian aid, especially the evacuation of children with disabilities through Poland and the importing of incubators to hospitals in warzone areas. Zelenska made her first public appearance since the start of the invasion in a 8 May 2022 meeting with Jill Biden in Uzhhorod. Biden's trip to Ukraine, which coincided with Mother's Day as celebrated in the US and in Ukraine, was not publicly disclosed in advance.  \nAt the initiative of the First Lady, projects in the field of medicine are being developed: evacuation of children with severe cancer diseases abroad with further treatment there, the search for equipment for children's hospitals, in particular, incubators for newborns.  \nIn the humanitarian sphere, Olena Zelenska takes care of sending orphans for a long-term stay abroad. The First Lady also oversees humanitarian aid to family-type orphanages, large families, and elderly people who have remained and live in the liberated territories to reinforce the connection with the Homeland for forcibly displaced people, the First Lady initiated the project “Books without borders”. 260,000 books in Ukrainian were printed for children who left their homes due to Russian aggression and found shelter in 20 countries.  \nThe project “Ukrainian bookshelf” is being carried out under the patronage of the First Lady. It provides for the distribution of Ukrainian literature and its translations in the world's leading libraries. More than 20 countries have already joined the initiative.  \nIn the “Barrier-Free Handbook” launched by the First Lady, a new section has been created with wartime tips and instructions for families with disabilities, the elderly and their loved ones, people with disabilities.  \nIn May 2022, Olena Zelenska initiated the creation of the National Program of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support.

He emphasized the necessity to resupply them and refresh their equipment. In the wake of the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014, Selva also introduced a new isolation unit to allow the Department of Defense to air transport multiple patients with highly infectious disease. The unit was later known as Transport Isolation System. The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved funding and four months later the Transport Isolation System began operations.\n\n## Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  \n<image>Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Selva speaks at the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference on August 14, 2016.\nIn May 2015 General Paul Selva was nominated by President Barack Obama to be the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During his confirmation hearing, Selva discussed the future threats and capabilities of foreign militaries. Selva identified Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as the nations that could be a possible threat to a future United States. He was confirmed by the US Senate in May 2015. He became the first Air Force general to assume the position since Richard Myers stepped down from the position after being appointed as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff back in 2001.  \nAs vice chairman Selva by the United States law became the second highest-ranking military officer in the United States Armed Forces and outranked all respective heads of each service branch with the exception of the chairman. He also became the head of Joint Requirements oversight Council (JROC) and also members of Defense Acquisition Board.\n<image>Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Selva piloting a Boeing KC-46A Pegasus on January 31, 2019\nDuring his tenure, Selva emphasized the importance of nuclear deterrence and also reasserted it as the joint force modernization priority. During testimony before the House panel on the military assessment of nuclear deterrence requirements, Selva said that over the past decade some consideration had been made to defer some nuclear force in order to modernize them to address urgent needs, while also maintaining a safe, reliable and secure nuclear arsenal and delivery capability. He said that the Joint Chiefs need to affirm the necessity to maintain the nuclear triad and to modernize the weapon system, the indications of warning, and the command and control associated with the nuclear triad. Selva spoke about the possibility of a \"Terminator weapons conundrum\" and believed that some of America adversary had prepared to create artificial intelligence-like weapons. He also said that the Department of Defense was working with experts on ethics in order to study the threat posed by this kind of weapon and what will happens when technology is brought into the execution of warfare.\n<image>alt=\nAs vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), which was in charge of Joint Requirement Oversight Committee and Defense Acquisition Board, Selva reasserted the need of increasing defense budget for 2017. During testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Selva defended the 2017 budget request and acknowledged the challenges to come. Selva also made clear that the Joint Chiefs were satisfied with the 2017 budget proposal during the Senate hearing.  \nOn May 16, 2017, General Selva was renominated for a second term as vice chair of the JCS  \nIn March 2017, General Selva told the US Congress that Russia had deployed a missile barred by treaty and had launched it in order to scare their neighboring NATO members countries. According to Selva, the Russian act violated the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. He was also concerned over China's military buildup in the Asian Pacific and emphasized their development of capabilities with the potential to compete United States military-technological advantages. Selva also said that the Chinese have shown its willingness to exploit their economy as leverage to advance their regional political objectives and as China's military modernization continues, the United States and its allies and partners nations will continue to balance the challenge and threat that China's carries. He further noted that a long-term and sustained presence is critical in order to demonstrate that the United States is committed to the Asia Pacific region, and emphasized that the United States will continue to develop a security network through multilateral partnership and will continue to develop capabilities to counter China's threat.\n<image>Selva visiting Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor on September 21, 2015\nIn July 2017 following the increasing tension between the United States and North Korea, Selva stated that North Korea could become a nuclear arms proliferator. He stated that although there is no evidence that North Korea had engaged in proliferation of their long-range ballistic missile technology, it was clear that North Korea have proliferated every other weapons system that they've ever invented. In October 2018 Selva stated that the Pentagon was planning to use satellites in order to defend the United States against enemy hypersonic weapons such as intercontinental ballistic missiles. The remarks came one day after the Defense Department revealed their final steps toward creating the new military branch Space Force, which include establishing a Space Development Agency.  \nIn June 2019, when the tension between the United States and Iran increased following the attack of an oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, Selva warned that Iran should steer clear of United States interests. But he said that the United States wouldn't mount a unilateral military response against Iran unless U.S. forces or interests within the region are targeted. According to Selva, any military response to the tanker attacks would require an international consensus before military force was used.  \nIn July 2019, Selva retired. However, some stated that Selva would most likely become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff if Hillary Clinton won the 2016 presidential election. A week before Selva was scheduled to retire, he conducted one of the United States Air Force's most famous traditions, a fini-flight, by flying a United States Air Force Gulfstream C-37 to Joint Base Andrews. Selva's retirement ceremony was held on July 31, 2019, at Joint Base Andrews and officially retired from 39 years of active duty within the United States Air Force.\n\n## Personal life  \nSelva with wife Ricki Selva in 2019  \nSelva was acknowledged in President Obama's announcement speech on May 5, 2015.  \nSelva achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America in 1974.  \nIn an April 5, 2020, phone call to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer touted Selva as a potential COVID-19 czar to oversee the production and disbursement of medical equipment.  \nIn October 2020, after having retired, he joined \"nearly 500\" national security experts and multiple former Trump appointees in endorsing the presidential candidacy of Joe Biden.  \n## Education  \n* 1980 Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering, U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado  \n* 1983 Squadron Officer School, Maxwell AFB, Alabama  \n* 1984 Master of Science degree in management and human relations, Abilene Christian University, Abilene, Texas  \n* 1992 Distinguished graduate, Air Command and Staff College, Maxwell AFB, Alabama  \n* 1992 Master of Science degree in political science, Auburn University, Montgomery, Alabama  \n* 1996 National Defense Fellow, Secretary of Defense Strategic Studies Group, Rosslyn, Alabama  \n## Assignments  \n-  June 1980 – July 1981, student, undergraduate pilot training, Reese AFB, Texas  \n-  July 1981 – December 1984, co-pilot and aircraft commander, 917th Air Refueling Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas  \n-  January 1984 – December 1988, co-pilot, aircraft commander, instructor pilot, and flight commander, 32d Air Refueling Squadron, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana  \n-  January 1989 – July 1991, company grade adviser to Commander, Strategic Air Command, later, manager of offensive aircraft systems and executive officer, Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Resources, Headquarters Strategic Air Command, Offutt AFB, Nebraska  \n-  August 1991 – July 1992, student, Air Command and Staff College, Maxwell AFB, Alabama  \n-  July 1992 – June 1994, instructor pilot and flight commander, 9th Air Refueling Squadron, later, Commander, 722d Operations Support Squadron, March AFB, California  \n-  June 1994 – June 1995, Commander, 9th Air Refueling Squadron, later, Deputy Commander, 60th Operations Group, Travis AFB, California  \n-  July 1995 – June 1996, National Defense Fellow, Secretary of Defense Strategic Studies Group, Rosslyn, Virginia  \n-  July 1996 – August 1998, assistant to the Director, Office of the Secretary of Defense for Net Assessment, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.  \n-  August 1998 – July 2000, Commander, 60th Operations Group, Travis AFB, California  \n-  July 2000 – June 2002, Commander, 62d Airlift Wing, McChord AFB, Washington  \n-  June 2002 – June 2003, Vice Commander, Tanker Airlift Control Center, Scott AFB, Illinois  \n-  June 2003 – November 2004, Commander, Tanker Airlift Control Center, Scott AFB, Illinois  \n-  December 2004 – August 2006, Director of Operations, U.S. Transportation Command, Scott AFB, Illinois  \n-  August 2006 – June 2007, Director, Air Force Strategic Planning, Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Programs, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C.  \n-  June 2007 – October 2008, Director, Air Force Strategic Planning, Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Programs, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, and Director, Air Force QDR, Office of the Vice Chief of Staff, Washington, D.C.  \n-  October 2008 – October 2011, Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Washington, D.C.  \n-  October 2011 – November 2012, Vice Commander, Pacific Air Forces, Joint-Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii  \n-  November 2012 – May 2014, Commander, Air Mobility Command, Scott AFB, Illinois  \n-  May 2014 – July 2015, Commander, U.S. Transportation Command, Scott AFB, Illinois  \n-  July 2015 – July 2019, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Washington, D.C.  \n## Flight information  \n* Rating: Command pilot  \n* Hours flown: More than 3,100  \n* Aircraft flown: C-5, C-17A, C-141B, C-37, KC-10, KC-135A and T-37  \n## Effective dates of promotion  \n## Awards and decorations  \n* On April 5, 2018, Business Executives for National Security (BENS), an industry sponsored non-profit run by titans of industry, presented Selva with the Eisenhower Award.  \n## Retirement  \nIn December 2019, Selva joined the board of The Aerospace Corporation.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Biology in fiction  \n<image>Boris Karloff in James Whale's 1931 film Frankenstein, based on Mary Shelley's 1818 novel. The monster is created by an unorthodox biology experiment.\nBiology appears in fiction, especially but not only in science fiction, both in the shape of real aspects of the science, used as themes or plot devices, and in the form of fictional elements, whether fictional extensions or applications of biological theory, or through the invention of fictional organisms. Major aspects of biology found in fiction include evolution, disease, genetics, physiology, parasitism and symbiosis (mutualism), ethology, and ecology.  \nSpeculative evolution enables authors with sufficient skill to create what the critic Helen N. Parker calls biological parables, illuminating the human condition from an alien viewpoint. Fictional alien animals and plants, especially humanoids, have frequently been created simply to provide entertaining monsters. Zoologists such as Sam Levin have argued that, driven by natural selection on other planets, aliens might indeed tend to resemble humans to some extent.  \nMajor themes of science fiction include messages of optimism or pessimism; Helen N. Parker has noted that in biological fiction, pessimism is by far the dominant outlook. Early works such as H. G. Wells's novels explored the grim consequences of Darwinian evolution, ruthless competition, and the dark side of human nature; Aldous Huxley's Brave New World was similarly gloomy about the effects of genetic engineering.  \nFictional biology, too, has enabled major science fiction authors like Stanley Weinbaum, Isaac Asimov, John Brunner, and Ursula Le Guin to create what Parker called biological parables, with convincing portrayals of alien worlds able to support deep analogies with Earth and humanity.\n\n## Aspects of biology  \nAspects of biology found in fiction include evolution, disease, ecology, ethology, genetics, physiology, parasitism, and mutualism (symbiosis).  \n### Evolution  \nEvolution, including speculative evolution, has been an important theme in fiction since the late 19th century. It began, however, before Charles Darwin's time, and reflects progressionist and Lamarckist views (as in Camille Flammarion's 1887 Lumen) as well as Darwin's. Darwinian evolution is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Other themes include the replacement of humanity, either by other species or by intelligent machines.  \n### Disease  \n<image>Jack London's 1912 The Scarlet Plague (reprinted in 1949) takes place after an uncontrollable epidemic.\nDiseases, both real and fictional, play a significant role in both literary and science fiction, some like Huntington's disease and tuberculosis appearing in many books and films. Pandemic plagues threatening all human life, such as The Andromeda Strain, are among the many fictional diseases described in literature and film. Science fiction takes an interest, too, in imagined advances in medicine. The Economist suggests that the abundance of apocalyptic fiction describing the \"near annihilation or total extinction of the human race\" by threats including deadly viruses rises when general \"fear and unease\", as measured by the Doomsday Clock, increase.  \nTuberculosis was a common disease in the 19th century. In Russian literature, it appeared in several major works. Fyodor Dostoevsky used the theme of the consumptive nihilist repeatedly, with Katerina Ivanovna in Crime and Punishment; Kirillov in The Possessed, and both Ippolit and Marie in The Idiot. Turgenev did the same with Bazarov in Father and Sons. In English literature of the Victorian era, major tuberculosis novels include Charles Dickens's 1848 Dombey and Son, Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 North and South, and Mrs. Humphry Ward's 1900 Eleanor.\n\n### Genetics  \nAspects of genetics including mutation or hybridisation,  cloning (as in Brave New World), genetic engineering, and eugenics have appeared in fiction since the 19th century. Genetics is a young science, having started in 1900 with the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's study on the inheritance of traits in pea plants. During the 20th century it developed to create new sciences and technologies including molecular biology, DNA sequencing, cloning, and genetic engineering. The ethical implications of modifying humans (and all their descendants) were brought into focus with the eugenics movement. Since then, many science fiction novels and films have used aspects of genetics as plot devices, often taking one of two routes: a genetic accident with disastrous consequences; or, the feasibility and desirability of a planned genetic alteration. The treatment of science in these stories has been uneven and often unrealistic.2018 The 1997 film Gattaca attempted to portray science accurately but was criticised by scientists. Michael Crichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park portrayed the cloning of whole dinosaur genomes from fossil remains of species extinct for millions of years, and their use to recreate living animals, using what was then known of genetics and molecular biology to create an \"entertaining\" and \"thought-provoking\" story.page=51  \n<image>Naomi Alderman's 2016 novel The Power imagines that women have electric organs like those of the electric eel, Electrophorus electricus, creating powerful electric fields with modified muscles. The pits along the electric eel's body are lateral line organs, used to detect prey by sensing small vibrations.\nThe lack of scientific understanding of genetics in the 19th century did not prevent science fiction works such as Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein and H. G. Wells's  1896 The Island of Dr Moreau from exploring themes of biological experiment, mutation, and hybridisation, with their disastrous consequences, asking serious questions about the nature of humanity and responsibility for science.\n\n### Physiology  \nThe creation scene in James Whale's 1931 film Frankenstein makes use of electricity to bring the monster to life. Shelley's idea of reanimation through electric shock was based on the physiology experiments of Luigi Galvani, who noted that a shock made the leg of a dead frog twitch. Electric shock is now routinely used in pacemakers, maintaining heart rhythm, and defibrillators, restoring heart rhythm.  \nThe ability to produce electricity is central to Naomi Alderman's 2016 science fiction novel  \nThe Power. In the book, women develop the ability to release electrical jolts from their fingers, powerful enough to stun or kill. Fish such as the electric eel, Electrophorus electricus, create powerful electric fields with modified muscles, stacked end-to-end as cells in a battery in their electric organs, and the novel indeed references such fish and the electricity generated in striated muscle.  \n### Parasitism  \n<image>A 1990s gargoyle at Paisley Abbey resembling a Xenomorph parasitoid from Alien\nParasites appear frequently in fiction, from ancient times onwards as seen in mythical figures like the blood-drinking Lilith, with a flowering in the nineteenth century. These include intentionally disgusting alien monsters in science fiction films, though these are sometimes less \"horrible\" than real examples in nature. Authors and scriptwriters have to some extent exploited parasite biology: lifestyles including parasitoid, behaviour-altering parasite, brood parasite, parasitic castrator, and many forms of vampire are found in books and films.  \nSome fictional parasites, like the deadly parasitoid Xenomorphs in Alien, have become well known in their own right. Terrifying monsters are clearly alluring: writer Matt Kaplan notes that they induce signs of stress including raised heart rate and sweating, but people continue indulging in such works. Kaplan compares this to the \"masochism\" of liking very hot spicy foods, which induce mouth burns, sweating, and tears. The psychologist Paul Rozin suggests that there is a pleasure in seeing one's own body react as if to stress while knowing that no real harm will result.\n\n### Symbiosis  \nSymbiosis (mutualism) appears in fiction, especially science fiction, as a plot device. It is distinguished from parasitism in fiction, a similar theme, by the mutual benefit to the organisms involved, whereas the parasite inflicts harm on its host. Fictional symbionts often confer special powers on their hosts. After the Second World War, science fiction moved towards more mutualistic relationships, as in Ted White's 1970 By Furies Possessed, which viewed aliens positively. In The Phantom Menace, Qui-Gon Jinn says microscopic lifeforms called midi-chlorians, inside all living cells, allow characters with enough of these symbionts in their cells to feel and use the Force.  \n### Ethology  \n<image>Delia Owens's 2018 novel Where the Crawdads Sing is set in a North Carolina swamp, where the \"marsh girl\" protagonist compares her wayward boyfriends to the \"Sneaky Fuckers\" she reads about in an ethology article.\nEthology, the study of animal behaviour, appears in the wildlife scientist Delia Owens's 2018 novel Where the Crawdads Sing. The protagonist, Kya, is abandoned by her parents at age six, and grows up alone in a North Carolina swamp, learning camouflage and how to hunt from the animals there. The local townspeople call her \"the marsh girl\". She reads about ethology including an article entitled \"Sneaky Fuckers\", using her knowledge to navigate the tricks and dating rituals of the local boys; and she compares herself to a female firefly, who uses her coded flashing light signal to lure a male of another species to his death, or a female mantis, who starts eating her mate's head and thorax while his abdomen is still copulating with her. \"Female insects, Kya thought, know how to deal with their lovers.\"\n\n### Ecology  \nEcology, the study of the relationships between organisms and their environment, appears in fiction in novels such as Frank Herbert's 1965 Dune, Kim Stanley Robinson's 1992 Red Mars, and Margaret Atwood's 2013 MaddAddam. Dune brought ecology centre stage, with a whole planet struggling with its environment. Its lifeforms included giant sandworms for whom water is fatal and mouse-like animals able to survive in the planet's desert conditions. The book was influential on the environmental movement of the time.  \nIn the 1970s, the impact of human activity on the environment stimulated a new kind of writing, ecofiction. It has two branches: stories about human impact on nature; and stories about nature (rather than humans). It encompasses books written in styles from modernism to magical realism, and in genres from mainstream to romance and speculative fiction. A 1978 anthology of ecofiction includes 19th and 20th century works by authors as diverse as Ray Bradbury, John Steinbeck, Edgar Allan Poe, Daphne du Maurier, E. B. White, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Frank Herbert, H. H. Munro, J. G. Ballard, and Isaac Asimov.  \n### Fictional organisms  \n<image>A mock taxidermy specimen of a fictional rhinograde invented by the German zoologist Gerolf Steiner\nFiction, especially science fiction, has created large numbers of fictional species, both alien and terrestrial. One branch of fiction, speculative evolution or speculative biology, consists specifically of the design of imaginary organisms in particular scenarios; this is sometimes informed by precise science.\n\n## Functions  \nFictional biology serves a variety of function in film and literature, including the supply of suitably terrifying monsters, the communication of an author's worldview, and the creation of aliens for  biological parables to illuminate what it is to be human. Real biology, such as of infectious diseases, equally provides a variety of contexts, from personal to highly dystopian, that can be exploited in fiction.  \n### Monsters and aliens  \nA common use of fictional biology in science fiction is to provide plausible alien species, sometimes simply as terrifying subjects, but sometimes for more reflective purposes. Alien species include H. G. Wells's Martians in his 1898 novel The War of the Worlds, the bug-eyed monsters of early 20th century science fiction, fearsome parasitoids, and a variety of giant insects, especially in early 20th century big bug movies.  \nHumanoid (roughly human-shaped) aliens are common in science fiction. One reason is that authors use the only example of intelligent life that they know: humans. The zoologist Sam Levin points out that aliens might indeed tend to resemble humans, driven by natural selection. Luis Villazon points out that animals that move necessarily have a front and a back; as with bilaterian animals on Earth, sense organs tend to gather at the front as they encounter stimuli there, forming a head. Legs reduce friction, and with legs, bilateral symmetry makes coordination easier. Sentient organisms will, Villazon argues, likely use tools, in which case they need hands and at least two other limbs to stand on. In short, a generally humanoid shape is likely, though octopus- or starfish-like bodies are also possible.  \nMany fictional plants were created in the 20th century, including John Wyndham's venomous, walking, carnivorous triffids. in his 1951 novel The Day of the Triffids, The idea of plants that could attack an incautious traveller began in the late 19th century; the potatoes in Samuel Butler's Erewhon had \"low cunning\". Early tales included Phil Robinson's 1881 The Man-Eating Tree with its gigantic flytraps, Frank Aubrey's 1897 The Devil Tree of El Dorado, and Fred White's 1899 Purple Terror. Algernon Blackwood's 1907 story \"The Willows\" powerfully tells of malevolent trees that manipulate people's minds.  \n### Optimism and pessimism  \n<image>H. G. Wells's 1898 The War of the Worlds struck a pessimistic note about human evolution.\nA major theme of science fiction and of speculative biology is to convey a message of optimism or pessimism according to the author's worldview. Whereas optimistic visions of technological progress are common enough in hard science fiction, pessimistic views of the future of humanity are far more usual in fiction based on biology.  \nA rare optimistic note is struck by the evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane in his tale, The Last Judgement, in the 1927 collection Possible Worlds. Both Arthur C. Clarke's 1953 Childhood's End and Brian Aldiss's 1959 Galaxies Like Grains of Sand, too, optimistically imagine that humans will evolve godlike mental capacities.  \nThe grim possibilities of Darwinian evolution with its ruthless \"survival of the fittest\" has been explored repeatedly from the beginnings of science fiction, as in H. G. Wells's novels The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Dr Moreau (1896), and The War of the Worlds (1898); these all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival. Aldous Huxley's 1931 novel Brave New World is similarly gloomy about the oppressive consequences of advances in genetic engineering applied to human reproduction.\n\n### Biological parables  \n<image>The protagonist's journey across Mars in Stanley Weinbaum's 1934 A Martian Odyssey\nThe literary critic Helen N. Parker suggested in 1977 that speculative biology could serve as biological parables which throw light on the human condition. Such a parable brings aliens and humans into contact, allowing the author to view humanity from an alien perspective. She noted that the difficulty of doing this at length meant that only a few major authors had attempted it, naming Stanley Weinbaum, Isaac Asimov, John Brunner, and Ursula Le Guin. In her view, all four had impressively full characterizations of alien beings. Weinbaum had created a \"bizarre assortment\" of intelligent beings, unlike Brunner's crablike but extinct Draconians.  What united all four writers, she argued, was that the novels centred on the interactions between aliens and humans, creating deep analogies between the two kinds of life and from there commenting on humanity now and in the future. Weinbaum's 1934 A Martian Odyssey explored the question of how aliens and humans could communicate, given that their thought processes were utterly different.  \nAsimov's 1972 The Gods Themselves both makes the aliens major characters, and explores parallel universes.  \nBrunner's 1974 Total Eclipse creates a whole alien world, extrapolated from terrestrial threats.  \nIn her 1969 The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin presents her vision of a universe of planets all inhabited by \"men\", descendants from the planet Hain. In the book, the ambassador Genly Ai from the civilised Ekumen worlds visits the \"backward- and inward-looking\" people of Gethen, only to end up in danger, from which he escapes by crossing the polar ice cap on a desperate but well-planned expedition with an exiled Gethenian Lord Chancellor, Estraven. They are ambisexual with no fixed gender, and go through periods of oestrus, called \"kemmer\", at which point an individual comes temporarily to function as either a male or a female, depending on whether they first encounter a male- or female-functioning partner during their period of kemmer. The invented biology reflects and exemplifies, according to Parker, the opposing but united dualities of Taoism such as light and darkness, maleness and femaleness, yin and yang. So too do the opposed characters of Genly Ai with his carefully objective reports, and of Estraven with his or her highly personal diary, as the story unfolds, illuminating humanity through adventure and science fiction strangeness.\n\n### Structure and themes  \n<image>\"The leafy sea dragon\" (actually weedy seadragon) from  William Buelow Gould's Sketchbook of fishes, c. 1832, used by Richard Flanagan in his 2001 novel Gould's Book of Fish\nModern novels sometimes make use of biology to provide structure and themes. Thomas Mann's 1912 Death in Venice relates the feelings of the protagonist to the progress of an epidemic of cholera, which eventually kills him.  \nRichard Flanagan's 2001 novel Gould's Book of Fish makes use of the illustrations from artist and convict William Buelow Gould's book of 26 paintings of fish for chapter headings and as the inspiration for the various characters in the novel.\n\n## Realism  \nThe geneticist Dan Koboldt observes that the science in science fiction is often oversimplified, reinforcing popular myths to the point of \"pure fiction\". In his own field, he gives as examples the idea that first-degree relatives have the same hair, eyes and nose as each other, and that a person's future is predicted by their genetic code, as (he states) in Gattaca. Koboldt points out that eye colour changes as children grow up: adults with green or brown eyes often had blue eyes as babies; that brown-eyed parents can have children with blue eyes, \"and vice versa\"; and that the brown pigment melanin is controlled by around 10 different genes, so inheritance is along a spectrum rather than being a blue/brown switch. Other authors in his edited collection Putting the Science in Fiction point out a wide variety of errors in the portrayal of other biological sciences.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a concept that explores the potential consequences of genetic engineering in human society?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# GE Dash 9 Series  \nThe Dash 9 Series is a line of diesel locomotives built by GE Transportation. It replaced the Dash 8 Series in the mid-1990s, and was superseded by the Evolution Series in the mid-2000s. Dash 9 series locomotives are some of the most common in the United States.  \n## Specifications  \nThe Dash 9 Series is an improved version of the Dash 8 Series.  Like that earlier Series, it has a microprocessor-equipped engine control unit, and a modular system of construction of the vehicle body.  \nAll models of the Dash 9 Series are powered by a 16-cylinder, turbocharged, GE 7FDL 4-stroke diesel engine, with electronic fuel injection and split cooling.  \nDash 9 Series locomotives also ride on HiAd high adhesion trucks, with low weight transfer characteristics and microprocessor controlled wheelslip.  \n## Six axle models  \n### Common feature  \nA specification common to all Dash 9 Series six axle models is the AAR wheel arrangement known as C-C  \n### C40-9  \nNS C40-9 # 8801.  \nThis version of the Dash 9 was manufactured between January and March 1995.  All 125 examples of this model are owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway.  \nThe C40-9 is the only model in the Dash 9 Series to feature the standard cab design. All were built with rooftop-mounted air conditioners which gives them a rather unusual and distinctive look - and were quickly coined \"top hats\" by the railfan community. Other than the standard cab, the model is identical in all specifications to the wide-nose \"North American\" safety cab Dash 9-40CW (or C40-9W) model (see below).  \nNS specifically requested the standard cab, and may have purchased more units had the Federal Railroad Administration not required it to purchase the wide-nose C40-9W version instead. Besides, standard cab GE's had become more expensive by the mid-1990s, since they were now considered optional equipment by the builder, and thus priced as such, and when a carrier is purchasing one or two hundred units of a particular model at a time, even a slight extra price for a customized cab can add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cost of a locomotive order.  \nIn 2015, the railroad announced the locomotives would be given a new wide cab, A.C. traction motors, cab signals, LSL and uprated to 4400 HP. The new locomotives will be designated as AC44C6M. The last of the \"top hats\" were rebuilt to AC44C6M's in November 2018.  \n* Power output: sigfig=3  \n### C40-9W  \nNS C40-9W # 9258.  \nAll 1,090 units of this model were built for the Norfolk Southern Railway, as road numbers 8889 to 9978. The orders for these units were basically an extension of NS's previous order for the standard cab Dash 9-40C (or C40-9) (see above). They were built under the same premise that a lower power rating than the abbr=on rating of the Dash 9-44CW (or C44-9W) (see below) would prolong the life of the engine, and use less fuel. However, there is a manual override switch that allows the engineer to run the engine with all abbr=on if necessary.  \nAs with the C40-9, Norfolk Southern began to upgrade their C40-9W's from 4,000 to 4,400 hp and AC traction in mid-2015, making them AC44C6M's as well.  \n* Power output: sigfig=3  \n### C44-9W  \n<image>Hamersley Iron C44-9W # 7072 at the Brockman 4 mine.\nThe C44-9W model was in production between 1993 and 2004 with 53 pre-production units being built for CSX with an extended Dash 8 carbody and trucks a couple years earlier.  \nOf all the Dash 9 Series models, this one received by far the greatest number of orders.  \nA total of 1,697 orders for C44-9W's were received from Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and successor BNSF Railway (known at the time as the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway).  \nOther large orders from North American operators were placed by Canadian National Railway and a number of operators that have since been absorbed by the present day Union Pacific Railroad, including Chicago and Northwestern and Southern Pacific.  \nSubstantial orders for this model were also received from operators in Australia and Brazil, in the latter case for 1600mm broad gauge versions.  \nGeneral Electric and Norfolk Southern agreed to rebuild 450 of these C44-9W's, making them AC44C6M's along with their C40-9's and C40-9W's. Norfolk Southern is essentially converting all of their Dash 9 units into AC44C6M's.  \n* Power output: sigfig=3\n\n### C-38AChe  \n<image>China Railway NJ2 0053.\nThe C-38AChe, also known as the NJ2, is operated by China Railway.  \nBuilt in Erie, Pennsylvania, it is based on a standard Dash 9-44CW (or C44-9W) (see above) and marketed as the GE C38AChe.  \nThe model was specially customised for high altitude operation on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway route.  \nIt is used on the Qingzang Railway, which connects Xining, Qinghai Province, to Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, in the People's Republic of China.  \n* Power output: sigfig=3\n\n## Eight axle model  \n### BB40-9W  \nThis is a 1000mm (meter gauge) version of the C40-9W.  It was manufactured between 1997 and 2006.  \nAll 141 examples of the model are owned by the Estrada de Ferro Vitória a Minas (EFVM), a railroad in Brazil.  \nThe model is equipped with four B-style trucks, two at each end, replacing the conventional C-style trucks. The different trucks are necessary due to the railroad load limit per axle, which is lb.  \nThe standard C40-9W traction motors cannot fit in the narrower trucks.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Pure (Miller novel)  \nPure is a 2011 novel by English author Andrew Miller. The book is the sixth novel by Miller and was released on 9 June 2011 in the United Kingdom through Sceptre, an imprint of Hodder & Stoughton. The novel is set in pre-revolutionary France and the upcoming turmoil is a consistent theme throughout. It follows an engineer named Jean-Baptiste Baratte and chronicles his efforts in clearing an overfilled graveyard that is polluting the surrounding area. Baratte makes friends and enemies as the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district.  \nMiller was inspired to write about the Les Innocents Cemetery after reading historian Philippe Ariès's brief description of its clearing and imagining the theatrics that must have been involved. The novel received positive reviews, particularly noting the quality of the writing. The novel was awarded the Costa Book Award 2011 for \"Best Novel\" and \"Book of the Year\", and was nominated for the Walter Scott Prize and South Bank award.  \n## Plot  \nA 28-year-old engineer named Jean-Baptiste Baratte is tasked with the removal of the Les Innocents cemetery from Les Halles, Paris in 1786 (the Place Joachim-du-Bellay now occupies the area) and the removal of its church. Baratte is an engineer with a single decorative bridge, built in his small hometown, comprising his entire career, and, as such, is somewhat surprised by his appointment; he does, however, endeavour to complete his task.  \nThe cemetery has been in use for many years but, given the number of people buried in such a small area, the bodies have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there.  \nWhile scouting the cemetery before his work begins Baratte goes to stay with the Monnards, a middle-class family with a beautiful young daughter, Ziguette. In the cemetery Baratte makes the acquaintance of Armand, the church organist who continues to play, but for no one as the church has long since closed, the reclusive Père Colbert, the mad church priest, and 14-year-old Jeanne, the granddaughter of the sexton, who has grown up in the cemetery and is instrumental to Baratte's research.  \nBaratte initially keeps his work secret from his acquaintances but they eventually come to know of his work and most accept it reluctantly though Ziguette, in particular, seems upset about the destruction of the cemetery.  \nFor the work, Baratte hires men from a mine that he formerly worked in and also hires his former friend, Lacoeur to come as a foreman. The work goes well until suddenly one-night Baratte is attacked by Ziguette who wounds him in his head. Ziguette is sent away and Baratte is left with permanent injuries including severe migraines, difficulty reading, and the loss of a sense of taste. After the injury, Baratte decides to move Heloïse, a known prostitute in the area, into the Monnard's home as his companion.  \nThough all goes well for Baratte after the injury he is called to the cemetery one night where he learns that Jeanne was attacked and raped by Lacoeur who commits suicide in penance. Baratte is ordered to cover up the suicide by his superiors and a rumour develops that he killed Lacoeur defending Heloïse.  \n## Characters  \n* Jean-Baptiste Baratte – the protagonist of the novel; engineering graduate of the École des Ponts et Chaussées and overseer of the project; originally from Normandy. The name is a reference to the biblical John the Baptist. Barattes nickname is \"Bêche\", which is French for \"Spade\", a reference to his career.  \n* Armand – the church's flamboyant and alcoholic organist; and close friend to Baratte; with links to \"the party of the future\".  \n* Héloïse Goddard – a prostitute, also known as \"The Austrian\" because of her resemblance to Queen Marie Antoinette, who specialises in indulging the peculiar perversions of her clients; also Baratte's love interest.  \n* Lecoeur – Baratte's old friend brought in as the foreman to the miners undertaking the excavation. English translation of the name is \"The Heart\".  \n* Ziguette Monnard – Barrate's landlord's daughter who attacks Baratte in the middle of the night, in opposition to his work.  \n* Marie – maid to the Monnards who spies on Baratte sleeping during the night.  \n* Jeanne – 14-year-old granddaughter to the church's sexton.  \n* Dr.Guillotin – a doctor who is observing the progress of the excavation for research purposes.  \n* Père Colbert – the church's mad priest.  \n## Themes  \n<image>alt=An engraving by Theodor Josef Hubert Hoffbauer of the Saints Innocents Cemetery and its church. The image shows the Rue Saint-Denis on the left, the church at the rear and the graveyard in the foreground. A burial is taking place.\nThe novel takes place immediately before the French Revolution and, while not discussed in the novel, a number of sights and incidents foreshadow the impending events. Clare Clark, in The Guardian, stated \"as Baratte's story unfolds, the impending revolution hangs over the narrative like the blade of the guillotine to come\", identifying a number of auguries of the future turmoil; including \"an organist playing to an empty church\", the local theatre putting on a production of Beaumarchais' The Marriage of Figaro; and a cart displaying the phrase \"M Hulot et Fils: Déménageurs à la Noblesse\" on its side (English: M Hulot and Son: Movers to the Nobility). In The Week, Michael Bywater stated he felt that the novel has \"a sense in the air that something decisive is going to happen, and happen soon\".  \nThomas Quinn for The Big Issue opined that the removal of the cemetery as a whole could be construed as Miller asking \"whether we should sweep away the past in the name of progress\" or if we should be \"confronting set ideas about what makes us human in the first place\".  \nMiller also aimed to imbue the novel with a sense of anxiety, especially concerning the decisions Jean-Baptiste must take. Commenting on fiction in general in an interview with Lorna Bradbury for The Daily Telegraph, Miller stated that \"a novel is a collection of anxieties held together, more or less well, more or less interestingly, by the chicken wire of plot\". Bradbury goes on to state \"that is absolutely the case with Pure, which details multiple counts of insanity as the panic-inducing business of razing the cemetery takes hold\". Of Pure specifically, Miller stated that \"I'm interested in what anxiety does to people\", \"in what happens when they can't respond the way the world expects them to. What happens when our sense of ourselves falls away under the pressure of circumstances? What's left? That's a very interesting place to be.\"  \nAnother theme prevalent in the novel is death, influenced in part by the death of Miller's father, to whom the book is dedicated. Miller stated that \"after the age of fortysomething, death is a taste in your mouth, and never goes away again\". The reviewer for The Australian called the novel \"a meditation on death and the frailty of the body and spirit\".\n\n## Development  \nMiller first heard about the clearing of the Les Innocents cemetery ten years before writing the novel, when reading a book by French medievalist and historian, Philippe Ariès; specifically, his 1977 work entitled L'Homme devant la mort, or The Hour of Our Death. Ariès' book did not go into a great deal of detail concerning this actual event, however, Miller was \"taken by the theatricality\" of it and decided to write a novel based around the exhumation. In an interview with Kira Cochrane he stated the novel \"appealed to him as being interesting, visually interesting\", stating \"it was when it all happened that made it stand out. It's the 1780s, a few years before the French revolution\". Miller further stated that his father's occupation as a doctor also had some bearing on his interest in the human body, stating \"I grew up looking at these things – my Beano and Dandy were the BMJ and The Lancet\". Miller decided not to include any French dialogue in the novel as \"it is so pretentious\" in an English-language novel, stating \"I was afraid that my editor would strike it out\".  \n### Publication history  \n* 2011, UK, Sceptre 978-1-4447-2425-7, pub date 9 Jun 2011, Hardback  \n* 2012, UK, Sceptre 978-1-4447-2428-8, pub date 5 Jan 2012, Paperback  \n* 2012, UK, Dreamscape Media, pub date 29 May 2012, Audiobook  \n* 2012, USA, Europa Editions 978-1-60945-067-0, pub date 29 May 2012, Paperback  \n### Novel's title  \nThe novel's title can be attributed to a number of aspects of the work. The purification of the cemetery and the recent change in social mores (in relation to dirt and decay) being the most immediately apparent. James Kidd, writing for The Independent, stated \"if this suggests one definition of purity, others are suggested by political undercurrents. Namely, the ideals that helped shape the French Revolution: Voltaire's call to reason, Rousseau's call to equality, and Robespierre's call to arms.\"  \n### Cover  \n<image>alt=Francisco Goya's 1797–1799 etching, The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. The self-portrait shows the artist seated and burying his head into his arms, as owls and bats surround and assail him.\nThe cover, created by Royston Knipe, was based on Francisco Goya's etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. It features Baratte in his pistachio green silk Charvet suit replacing the recumbent Goya in his self-portrait. Instead of the owls and bats which assail Goya in The Sleep of Reason, Knipe used ravens. The cover was noted by The Guardian writer John Dugdale, in an article about the marketing aspect of book cover design, as being unique in the current market. He stated that; along with the covers for The Sense of an Ending and The Tiger's Wife; \"None of the three looks like anything else in bookshops\".\n\n### Audio adaptations  \nA Sweet Talk production of Pure was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as part of the Book at Bedtime programme from 20–31 August 2012; it was read by John Sessions, abridged by Jeremy Osborne and produced by Rosalynd Ward.  \nThe novel was also the inspiration for two songs written by Bath based musicians, The Bookshop Band, namely \"The downfall of Les Innocents\" and \"The Engineer's Paris\" from their album Into The Farthest Reaches.  \n## Reception  \nThe novel received almost universal praise, with reviewers praising Miller's approach to the subject, his vividly rendered characters and setting and his eloquent prose.  \nIn a review for The Independent, James Urquhart found the novel to be \"richly textured\" and that it had \"energetic, acutely observed characters\"; stating \"Miller populates Baratte's quest for equanimity with these lush and tart characters, seductively fleshed out, who collectively help to deliver the bittersweet resolution of Baratte's professional and personal travails.\" Clare Clark, writing for The Guardian, found that \"Miller is a writer of subtlety and skill\" and stated that she found the novel to be much like a parable, stating that \"Unlike many parables, however, Pure is neither laboured nor leaden. Miller writes like a poet, with a deceptive simplicity – his sentences and images are intense distillations, conjuring the fleeting details of existence with clarity.\" Clark goes on to say that \"Pure defies the ordinary conventions of storytelling, slipping dream-like between lucidity and a kind of abstracted elusiveness. The characters are often opaque. The narrative lacks dramatic structure, unfolding in the present tense much as life does, without clear shape or climax\" and found that \"The result is a book that is unsettling and, ultimately, optimistic.\" The Australian's Jennifer Levasseur found Pure to be \"Well-executed and inventive\", stating that she found the plot \"Historically convincing, immediately engaging and intellectually stimulating\". She went on to state, of Miller himself: \"Miller is the calibre of writer who deserves to be followed regardless of topic, time period or setting because of his astonishing dexterity with language, his piercing observations and his ability to combine rollicking storytelling with depth of character.\"  \nNovelist Brian Lynch, writing for the Irish Independent found \"The story in Pure is simple, almost dreamlike, a realistic fantasy, a violent fairy tale for adults\", stating \"At its best Pure shimmers\". The novel received two reviews from The Daily Telegraph. Freya Johnston found that \"Miller lingers up close on details: sour breath, decaying objects, pretty clothes, flames, smells, eyelashes. He is a close observer of cats\" and stated, of Baratte's project as a whole, \"Miller intimately imagines how it might have felt to witness it.\" Holly Kyte found Pure to be \"irresistibly compelling\" and \"Exquisite inside and out\". She stated that \"Every so often a historical novel comes along that is so natural, so far from pastiche, so modern, that it thrills and expands the mind\" and that she found that \"Pure is a near-faultless thing: detailed, symbolic and richly evocative of a time, place and man in dangerous flux. It is brilliance distilled, with very few impurities.\" Suzi Feay, for the Financial Times, stated \"Quietly powerful, consistently surprising, Pure is a fine addition to a substantial body of work\" and also noted that \"Miller's portraits of women and the poor are thoughtful and subtle.\" Writing for the Daily Express Vanessa Berridge found the novel to be \"very atmospheric, if not to say positively creepy at times\" and stated that \"Miller's eloquent novel overflows with vitality and colour. It is packed with personal and physical details that evoke 18th-century Paris with startling immediacy.\"  \nIn a review for The Observer, Leo Robson found the novel to be somewhat underwhelming, stating that \"It is disappointing, given the vitality of the novel's setting and set-up, that Miller fails to achieve corresponding dynamism in the development of plot and character\", adding that \"as a prose writer, Miller appears averse to taking risks, which means no pratfalls – but no glory either\". He found the \"engineer's progress and his setbacks are narrated in a patient, tight-lipped present tense, and just as the novel rarely concerns itself with anything that doesn't impinge on the destruction of Les Innocents, so it rarely deviates from its obsessive regime of description and dialogue\". He did somewhat temper this, however, stating that \"It is one of the historical novel's advantages over the topical or journalistic novel that the benchmark is plausibility rather than verifiable authenticity. Success in this effort requires a capacity for immersion and a degree of imagination, and whatever his shortcomings as a prose writer and a storyteller, Andrew Miller is endowed with both.\"  \n## Awards and nominations  \nThe novel was not longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, to the surprise of a number of reviewers. The novel did, however, win the Costa Book Award in 2011 for the \"Best Novel\" and \"Book of the Year\".  \nNovelist Rose Tremain, writing for The Guardian, identified the novel as one of her two \"Books of the year 2011\". In 2012, The Observer named it as one of \"The 10 best historical novels\". It was shortlisted for the 2012 Walter Scott Prize for historical fiction, with judges praising the novel as \"a wholly unexpected story, richly imagined and beautifully structured\"; and the South Bank Award in the \"Literature\" category. The novel was also short-listed for the \"Independent Booksellers' Week\" Book Awards, which are voted for by the public through independent book-shops. The marketing campaign for the novel was short-listed in the \"Best Overall Package\" award by the Book Marketing Society in their Best Marketing Campaign of the Year awards.  \nPure was identified as an \"Editors' Choice\" by The New York Times in June 2012. The novel was also listed on the Belfast Telegraph \"Your Top Choice\" listing for the best book of the week. Pure has, lc=y, been listed twelve times; with the first seven being in position 1. NPR listed it as one of their \"Critics' Lists\" for summer 2012 in the \"Rich Reads: Historical Fiction Fit for a Queen\" section, nominated by historical fiction author Madeline Miller who stated that \"this is historical fiction at its best.\"  \n### Costa \"Book of the Year\"  \nSpeaking about the novel at the awards ceremony in Piccadilly, London, Miller stated that he \"had no special sense of this one being the one\" and mentioned that \"it's a strange journey, you spend three years in a room on your own and then this: a little unsettling but deeply pleasurable\"; \"It's a very happy occasion\". Chair of the judging, editor of the Evening Standard newspaper Geordie Greig, said that the panel were basing their decision partially on the durability and memorability of the work, stating \"we were looking for quality\".  \nThe judges were undecided over whether the prize should have gone to Matthew Hollis' biography Now All Roads Lead to France instead. The judging panel was locked in a \"fierce debate and quite bitter dissent\" and eventually used a vote to decide on the winner. Geordie Greig said \"it was not unpleasant, it was forthright\", stating \"it's not like comparing apples and oranges – it's like comparing bananas and curry.\" Chair for the selection in 2010, web editor for Foyles bookshops Jonathan Ruppin, supported the decision, stating \"Like Hilary Mantel, who finally became a major name when she won the Man Booker, Miller should now gain the commercial success his stylish and absorbing novels have long deserved.\" He goes on to say \"Pure perfectly captures the mood of a downtrodden and angry nation, on the verge of overthrowing a self-serving and out-of-touch ruling class – it's very much a book for our time.\"  \nThe 2011 awards were subject to some attention from bookmakers, who offered odds of 2/1 for favourite Matthew Hollis' biography Now All Roads Lead To France and odds of 3/1 for Miller's Pure.\n\nQuestion: Which theme is common to the novel discussed in the description of the first image and the artwork depicted in the second image?\nChoice list: \nA.

He previously competed in the FIA Formula 3 Championship in 2020, 2021 and 2022.  \n## Racing career  \n### Lower formulae  \n2017 was Smolyar's debut season in single-seater racing. He competed for SMP Racing in the Spanish and Russian Formula 4 Championships, finishing 3rd in both. He scored a total of 24 podiums, with all of his race wins coming in the Spanish Championship.  \n### Formula Renault Eurocup  \n#### 2018  \nIn the following two years the Russian driver raced in the Formula Renault Eurocup. In his debut campaign, driving for Tech 1 Racing, Smolyar finished 12th in the standings, beating out two of his three teammates and helping the team to finish 5th in the team championship.  \n#### 2019  \nHis 2019 season would prove to be much more successful. He finished 3rd and won three races, only being beaten in the championship by Frenchman Victor Martins and his R-ace GP teammate, Oscar Piastri.  \n### FIA Formula 3 Championship  \n#### 2020  \nSmolyar was signed by ART Grand Prix to drive for them in the 2020 Formula 3 Championship alongside ADAC F4 champion Théo Pourchaire and Sebastián Fernández. Despite a slew of strong performances, which included a pole position at the Hungaroring and a win on the road at the first round in Britain the Russian's season was plagued with bad luck. This included having his win taken away by a penalty for weaving on the Hangar straight as well as a collision at the first corner in Budapest. Smolyar scored his only podium of the season in the second race at Monza and ended up eleventh in the standings, behind eventual runner-up Pourchaire, but ahead of his more experienced teammate Fernández.  \n#### 2021  \n<image>Smolyar driving the Dallara F3 2019 during the 2021 Spielberg Formula 3 round.\nFor the 2021 season Smolyar re-signed with ART, this time partnering Frederik Vesti and racing returnee Juan Manuel Correa. Smolyar's start to the season was strong, with him taking his first Formula 3 victory in the first race of the opening weekend. He then continued his good form and came out victorious in race one at the Circuit Paul Ricard, after having battled from sixth on the grid to first on the final lap. Smolyar finished the season with a total of 106 points, placing 6th in the championship. During that season, he scored a total of 2 wins, 2 fastest laps, and 4 podiums.\n\n#### 2022  \n<image>Smolyar driving for MP Motorsport during the 2022 Spielberg Formula 3 round.\nOn 20 January 2022, Smolyar announced that he would switch to MP Motorsport for the 2022 season. However, he was banned of using the Russian flag due to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. He was initially not due to race in the championship due to the mentioned war, but eventually was allowed to race. Smolyar was forced to miss the Silverstone round of the championship since he could not get to the United Kingdom due to visa issues, and was replaced by Filip Ugran. He returned to his seat for the remaining events and picked up his sole win of the season in the feature race in Budapest.

        "question": "Analyze the given context and associated images, draw inferences from the combination of both, and provide responses to posed questions.\nContext:\n# Chinese mythological geography  \n<image>Magpie Bridge (Queqiao), crossing the Silver River (Milky Way), one of the famous mythological locations of Chinese mythology. Depicted as a mural decorating the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, in Beijing.\nChinese mythological geography refers to the related mythological concepts of geography and cosmology, in the context of the geographic area now known as \"China\", which was typically conceived of as the center of the universe. The \"Middle Kingdom\" thus served as a reference point for a geography sometimes real and sometimes mythological, including lands and seas surrounding the Middle Land, with mountain peaks and sky (Heaven or heavens) above, with sacred grottoes and an underworld below, and even sometimes with some very abstract other worlds.\n\n## Mythological geography of China  \n\"Chinese mythology\" refers to mythology associated with the geographic area now known as \"China\", and in traditional Chinese mythology often known as the \"Middle Kingdom\". Chinese mythology includes many varied myths from regional and cultural traditions. Chinese mythology is far from monolithic, not being an integrated system, even among just Han people. Chinese mythology is encountered in the traditions of various classes of people, geographic regions, historical periods including the present, and from various ethnic groups. China is the home of many mythological traditions, including that of Han Chinese and their Huaxia predecessors, as well as Tibetan mythology, Turkic mythology, Korean mythology, and many others. However, the study of Chinese mythology tends to focus upon material in  Chinese language. Much of the mythology involves exciting stories full of fantastic people and beings, the use of magical powers, often taking place in an exotic mythological place or time. Along with Chinese folklore, Chinese mythology forms an  important part of Chinese folk religion (Yang 2005, 4, and elsewhere). In these cases, Chinese mythological geography forms and informs these ideational processes.  \n## Cosmology  \n\"Cosmology\" refers to the entirety of the Earth and its environment, significantly including Heaven (or Sky), Earth, a mythological underworld, and other less Earth-oriented conceptual locations.  \n### Earth  \nIn ancient China, the Earth was held to be flat.  \n### Heaven  \n\"Heaven\" (or \"sky\") refers to the universe outward of the Earth's surface and the concept of it as a liminal place that guides fate.  \n### Underworld  \n<image>Ox-Head and Horse-Face in the Hell Scroll at Seattle Asian Art Museum\n\"Underworld\" (or \"Hell\") refers to the universe located underneath the Earth's surface. Apparently this motif appears relatively late in the course of the development of Chinese mythology. The introduction of Buddhism certainly seems to have included a greater focus upon the fate of the soul and detailed depictions of a possible afterlife underground.\n\n### Otherworldly locations  \n\"Non-Earth-based locations\", include, for example the Pure Lands of Buddhism.  \n## Geography  \n### Middle earth  \nThe perspective of Chinese mythological geography tends to focus on the locus of those possessing the myths, as a \"center\" or \"middle\" area, based on land, with Sky above, Underworld below, and replete with mountains, seas, islands, and grottoes. Mythological locations tend to be replete with local inhabitants, of a mythological variety. Although Chinese mythological geography tends to focus on humans existing on a middle land territory of earth, a major motif is change, such as in the flood mythology of China.  \n#### Mountains  \nVarious mountains present an appearance in Chinese mythology. The Kunlun Mountain(s) of mythology are associated with a number of deities, such as Xiwangmu, Yu Shi, various shamans, and xian immortals.  \n##### Example  \nAs the mythology related to the Kunlun developed, it became influenced by the later introduction of ideas about an axis mundi from the cosmology of India. The Kunlun became identified with (or took on the attributes of) Mount Sumeru (Christie 1968, 74).  \n#### Grottoes  \nThe counter feature to the holy or sacred mountains and peaks were the grotto-heavens, and various grottoes appear in Chinese mythological landscape. Sometimes sacred grottoes are associated with sacred mountains; and both may correspond to actual geolocations, but with an overlay of mythological geography.  \n#### Seas  \nVarious seas or oceans present an appearance in Chinese mythology. Sometimes \"the Sea\" appears in a generic way, or in a directionally designated way such, as in the Jingwei story involving the Eastern Sea. Often a Dragon King was located in a sea, appropriately palaced. Sometimes sea and dry land were thought to alternate, as in the case of the Mulberry Fields and the sea related in the story of Magu.  \n#### Rivers  \nVarious rivers appear in Chinese mythology.  \n##### Example  \nVarious mythological geography is associated with the Red River, including one or more of the eight mountain pillars, especially the rivers thought to flow from or surround (mythological) Kunlun Mountain, the Weak River, the Black River, and intervening terrain, such as the Moving Sands. Jade Mountain was also in the vicinity (Yang 2005: 160-162).  \n#### Islands  \nVarious islands present an appearance in Chinese mythology.  \n### Inhabitants and other features  \nThe inhabitants and features of Chinese mythological geography add life and interest to the whole subject, and contribute toward more complete mythological narratives. Examples include mythological plants, animals, humans, other beings, magical jewels, weapons and other objects.  \n### Philosophers  \nThere were a number of schools of thought about Chinese cosmology. Very few pieces of information are known about the Suan Ye school, except that its followers believed the stars and the sun moved on their own in space. Another philosophical school held that the universe was a cosmic egg, the sky was a painting on the top half of the shell, and that the flat Earth floated on top of water that dominated the bottom half. An older tradition, Zhou Bei, taught that the sky was a concave bowl that rotated.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a concept that was influenced by the introduction of Buddhism into Chinese mythology?\nChoice list: \nA. A mural showing a heavenly bridge connecting two points across the sky.\nB. A painting of a tranquil garden with scholars reading.\nC.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Melanie Martinez  \nMelanie Adele Martinez (born April 28, 1995) is an American singer and songwriter. Born in Astoria, Queens, and raised in Baldwin, New York, Martinez rose to fame in 2012 after appearing on season 3 of the American television talent show The Voice. Following the show, she was signed to Atlantic Records and released her debut single \"Dollhouse\", followed by her debut extended play of the same name (2014).  \nMartinez later released her debut studio album, Cry Baby (2015), which went on to be certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album amassed numerous commercially successful singles including \"Pity Party\", \"Soap\" and \"Mrs. Potato Head\". Martinez released two follow-up albums, K–12 (2019) and Portals (2023). that were released on September 6, 2019 and March 31, 2023 respectively.  \n## Early life  \nMelanie Adele Martinez was born on April 28, 1995 in Astoria, Queens, to parents Mery and Jose Martinez, who are of Dominican and Puerto Rican descent. Her family moved to Baldwin, New York, on Long Island, when Martinez was four.  \nMartinez attended Plaza Elementary School, crediting her teacher Mr. Nadien with teaching her how to sing, and in kindergarten, Martinez began writing poetry. Martinez says she had few friends growing up and was a homebody, as she was \"very emotional\" and found it difficult to explain her feelings, crying when overwhelmed. She practiced photography and painting. Due to her emotionality as a child, she says that others referred to her as a \"cry baby\", which sparked the creation of the titular character of her debut album, Cry Baby.  \nMartinez grew up in a \"traditional Latin household\" where she was made to feel shameful about talking about her sexuality and felt as if she would not be accepted if she came out as bisexual. She says that her family is now fully accepting of her sexuality.  \nAt fourteen, Martinez taught herself how to play guitar by studying chord diagrams of songs she enjoyed, which she found online, and wrote her first song by adding her poetry to one of the chord diagrams, but says that playing guitar \"eventually got stale\". Martinez graduated from Baldwin High School.  \n## Career  \n### 2012–2014: Breakthrough with The Voice and Dollhouse EP  \nIn 2012, during her junior year of high school, Martinez participated in the MSG Varsity Talent Show, a televised talent competition. She sang the Beatles' rendition of \"Money (That's What I Want)\" by Barrett Strong and \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" by the Four Tops. She was eliminated in the second round.  \n<image>Martinez (right) with Terry McDermott (left) during The Voice\nMartinez then auditioned for the third season of The Voice. She had not watched the show herself prior to the audition. The initial, untelevised audition was an open call, held at Javits Center. She recalls that while she and her mother were driving to the audition, her mother's car broke down before they reached the Queens–Midtown Tunnel, and the two were forced to \"hitchhike\" a taxicab in order to get there. Several months after the initial audition, while at Roosevelt Field Mall, Martinez received word that she had advanced to the \"second round\". She then received multiple callbacks until she was finally selected to audition on the show itself. Martinez auditioned singing Britney Spears's \"Toxic\" with three of the four judges (Adam Levine, CeeLo Green and Blake Shelton) hitting their \"I Want You\" button. Martinez ultimately chose Adam Levine to be her coach.  \nIn the Battle Round, Martinez competed against Caitlin Michele. They performed a duet of the Ellie Goulding song \"Lights\". Martinez won and moved on to the Knockout Round. Michele was stolen by Cee Lo Green and also moved on. In the Knockout Round, Martinez was paired with Sam James. She chose to sing La Roux's \"Bulletproof\". Levine eliminated James, and Martinez moved on to the Live Rounds as one of the five remaining members of Team Adam. In week one of the Live Rounds, Martinez sang \"Hit the Road Jack\". Public vote saved Team Adam members Amanda Brown and Bryan Keith. Levine then chose Martinez over Loren Allred and Joselyn Rivera to remain in the competition. In week three, Martinez's performance of \"Seven Nation Army\" finished the voting period at #10 on the iTunes Top 200 Single Chart, causing her iTunes votes to be multiplied by ten. This occurred again in week four, when \"Too Close\" ended the voting period at #6.  \nMartinez was eliminated by audience vote in week five, along with the fellow Team Adam member Amanda Brown, leaving Levine with no artists. In response, Martinez said, \"I never expected to get this far and this is beyond what I've ever dreamed of. I'm just so glad I got to express who I am as an artist and really touch people's hearts because that was the ultimate goal\".  \nborder=darkgray – Studio version of performance reached the top 10 on iTunes  \nAfter the show, Martinez began working independently on original material, which she says she spent the majority of 2013 writing. She released her debut single, \"Dollhouse\", on February 9, 2014. She later compared the song's story to Edward Scissorhands, saying \"It's the perfect home with the perfect lawn and they all look the same. But behind each house there's a screwed up group of people who are hiding behind wealth and perfection.\" Martinez also released a music video for the track, which was fan-funded by an Indiegogo page created by Martinez, and hair, makeup, and shooting were all done by friends of hers. The song was produced and cowritten by NYC songwriting duo Kinetics & One Love.  \nOn April 7, 2014, Martinez signed to Atlantic Records and released her debut EP, Dollhouse, a month later on May 19, 2014. The only single from the EP, \"Carousel\", reached number nine on the Alternative Digital Songs chart, was certified gold by the RIAA, and featured in a preview for FX's miniseries American Horror Story: Freak Show. She promoted the EP with the Dollhouse Tour which lasted from June 2014 to March 2015.\n\n### 2015–2022: Cry Baby, K–12 and After School EP  \n<image>Martinez (pictured) performing in 2015 on the Cry Baby Tour.\nOn June 1, 2015, Martinez released the single \"Pity Party\", which sampled Lesley Gore's \"It's My Party\". This was followed by the album's second single, \"Soap\". The song reached number twelve on the Alternative Digital Songs chart, and number sixteen on the Pop Digital Songs chart. The third single, \"Sippy Cup\", followed on July 31. Cry Baby, her debut album, was released on August 14, 2015, to moderate critical acclaim and debuted at number 6 on the Billboard 200. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA on February 24, 2017. Martinez went on the Cry Baby Tour to promote the album, which lasted from 2015 to 2017.  \nIn May 2016, Martinez released her second EP, Pity Party, in Ireland, Mexico and the UK exclusively. A month later, Martinez said she had started working on and recording her second album. In November 2016, Martinez released her third EP, Cry Baby's Extra Clutter, a physical vinyl release of the bonus tracks from Cry Baby as well as \"Gingerbread Man\", a Christmas-themed single which was initially released in December 2015 on SoundCloud but later released as a solo single in January 2016.  \nIn October 2016, Martinez released a commercial for her fragrance, Cry Baby Perfume Milk, noting that the \"idea for this perfume has been cultivating in my brain since the moment I finished writing\" Cry Baby. The perfume was directly distributed by Martinez's record label, Atlantic, making them the first record label to distribute a fragrance. Martinez also collaborated with cosmetics company Lime Crime, Inc. to release two \"exclusive\" lipsticks: a blue lipstick called \"Cry Baby\" on August 17, 2015, and a brown lipstick called \"Teddy Bear\" on March 9, 2016.  \nOn May 15, 2019, Martinez released a teaser trailer for her second album, K–12 which was eventually released on September 6, 2019, and debuted at number 3 on Billboard 200. The album was accompanied by a musical fantasy horror film, which was written and directed by Martinez. In an interview with People, Martinez alluded to future sequels and visual albums being released. The album was promoted with the K–12 Tour began on October 13, 2019, in Washington, D.C. and concluded prematurely on February 17, 2020, in Brixton, England due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nIn January 2020, Martinez announced she was working on an EP titled After School, which was then set to be released in the spring of 2020 and serve as the deluxe edition of K–12. On February 10, 2020, Martinez released a stand-alone single, \"Copy Cat\" which featured Tierra Whack, marking Martinez's first feature. Martinez later released a second single from the EP, \"Fire Drill\", on June 26, 2020, which had previously featured in the credits of the K–12 film. Both songs were not included on After School, which was eventually delayed and released on September 25, 2020.  \nIn April 2020, \"Play Date\" became one of the top 100 most-played songs on Spotify in the US after gaining popularity on TikTok. In 2021, Martinez featured on Forbes Under 30 list.\n\n### 2023–present: Portals  \nOn February 18, 2023, after archiving all her Instagram posts, Martinez teased her third studio album, Portals. The album was released on March 31, 2023, and was promoted with the singles, \"Death\" and \"Void\" which charted at number 95 and 61 respectively, marking her first original appearances on the Billboard Hot 100.efn|While participating on The Voice in 2012, Martinez's covers of \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"Too Close\" had charted on the Hot 100. She embarked on the Portals Tour in May 2023.Martinez was nominated for the VMA's Best Visual Effects, for the music for her single \"Void\". She was eventually defeated by Taylor Swift in the final round, losing to Anti-Hero.  \n## Artistry  \n### Musical style  \nMartinez's music has been described as pop, alternative pop, art pop, electropop, and dark pop. Cry Baby and K–12 were seen to have hip hop and R&B undertones. Portals saw Melanie venturing into experimental sounds and pop-rock.  \nMartinez's music has been described by The Guardian as \"off-kilter, sweary electropop\". Rolling Stone described Martinez's music as \"twisted lullabies about love, danger and madness\", and compared her music to that of \"'Coin-Operated Boy'-era Dresden Dolls\" and Lana Del Rey. The New York Timess  \nJon Pareles described her music as \"perching prettily tinkling keyboards and concise pop choruses amid the slow, ominous basslines and twitchy percussion of Southern hip-hop – a candy-coated variation on the dirges of Lorde and Lana Del Rey\", and described her mezzo-soprano voice as \"whispery, sardonic, tearful, and furious\". Billboards Jason Lipshutz also compared Martinez to Del Rey and Lorde, saying, \"Martinez is clearly cribbing from the dimly lit pop stylings of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, but while her wispy delivery strikes the same femme fatale poses, she lacks the subtlety of her influences\", and that \"Martinez is admirably ambitious, but her insistence on sticking to Cry Babys central idea leaves her contorting into uncomfortable positions\".  \nMartinez describes her alter ego and the protagonist of her debut album, Cry Baby, as a \"fairy tale\" version of herself.  Martinez's songs are often based on personal experiences. Martinez described her own music as \"very dark and honest\" and \"hip hop/trap inspired beats with creepy nostalgic childlike sounds such as baby pianos, music boxes, and toys\".  \n### Influences  \nMartinez listened to Christina Aguilera, Brandy, Britney Spears,  The Beatles, Tupac Shakur, Shakira, and Biggie Smalls growing up, and wanted to be a singer from a young age.  \nMartinez has cited The Beatles, Neutral Milk Hotel, Feist, Kimbra, Zooey Deschanel, Regina Spektor, and CocoRosie as influences of hers. Specific albums which have influenced her music include The Idler Wheel... by Fiona Apple and Ariana Grande's albums Yours Truly and My Everything. She attributes the \"heavy hip-hop influence\" in her music to her father playing hip-hop music in the family's house often during her childhood.  \nThe visuals in Martinez's music videos have been influenced by her favorite visual artists: Mark Ryden, Aleksandra Waliszewska and Nicoletta Ceccoli. She named Tim Burton as a large influence of hers, and has said that to make a movie with him would be her \"one dream\".  \n## Public image  \nAt age sixteen, after watching 101 Dalmatians, Martinez dyed half of her hair blonde, in the same vein as Cruella de Vil. She became known for the look, as well as her \"baby doll\"-inspired outfits in music videos and when performing.  The Guardian has called her image \"doll-like and decidedly emo... hyperreal\" while her music is best known to be \"part-nursery rhyme, part tragic life story\".  \n### Sexual assault allegation  \nOn December 4, 2017, Timothy Heller, a woman with whom Martinez once shared a friendship, alleged via Twitter that Martinez had sexually assaulted and raped her. The following day, Martinez tweeted a response to Heller's accusations, saying the allegations \"horrified and saddened\" her, and that Heller \"never said no to what they chose to do together\". On December 9, 2017, Martinez released a second statement, thanking her fans for citing Heller's \"false statements\". She concluded the statement with: \"...I would never be intimate with someone without their absolute consent.\" Martinez released the song \"Piggyback\" on SoundCloud, an act believed to be in response to Heller's accusations.  \nIn a review of Martinez's third album, Portals, Sam Franzini of The Line of Best Fit wrote that the album track \"Battle of the Larynx\" is \"a five-minute saga detailing serious accusations leveled against her\".  \n## Discography  \nStudio albums  \n* Cry Baby (2015)  \n* K–12 (2019)  \n* Portals (2023)  \n## Filmography  \n### Film  \n### Television  \n### Web  \n## Tours  \nHeadlining  \n* Dollhouse Tour (2014–2015)  \n* Cry Baby Tour (2015–2017)  \n* K–12 Tour (2019–2020)  \n* Portals Tour (2023-2024)  \nSupporting  \n* Lindsey Stirling – Music Box Tour (2015)  \n* Adam Lambert – The Original High Tour (2016)  \n## Awards and nominations\n\nQuestion: Which song performed by the artist in the images was featured in a preview for FX's miniseries American Horror Story: Freak Show?\nChoice list: \nA. \"Pity Party\"\nB. \"Soap\"\nC. \"Carousel\"\nD. \"Sippy Cup\"\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.",

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# 2020 Malian coup d'état  \nOn 18 August 2020, elements of the Malian Armed Forces began a mutiny, and subsequently undertook a coup d'état. Soldiers on pick-up trucks stormed the Soundiata military base in the town of Kati, where gunfire was exchanged before weapons were distributed from the armory and senior officers arrested. Tanks and armoured vehicles were seen on the town's streets, as well as military trucks heading for the capital, Bamako. The soldiers detained several government officials including President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, who resigned and dissolved the government. This was the country's second coup in less than 10 years, following the 2012 coup d'état.  \n## Background  \nProtests in Mali had been ongoing since 5 June, with protesters calling for the resignation of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. Protesters were displeased with the government's management of the ongoing insurgency, alleged government corruption, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and a floundering economy. Eleven deaths and 124 injuries were reported during the protests.  \n## Coup d'état  \nOn the morning of 18 August 2020, soldiers began firing bullets into the air at a military base in Kati, a town abbr=off from Bamako, the capital of Mali. After moving into the capital, the mutineers arrested Minister of Finance Abdoulaye Daffe, the Chief of Staff of the National Guard fr, and Moussa Timbiné, speaker of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister, Boubou Cissé, appealed for dialogue with the mutineers, acknowledging they held \"legitimate frustrations\". A mutiny leader later claimed that Keïta and Cissé had been arrested at the former's residence in Bamako; African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki confirmed that Keïta, Cissé, and other officials had been arrested and called for their release. A spokesman for the M5-RFP opposition coalition welcomed their detention, describing it as a \"popular insurrection\".  \nThe officials were taken to the military camp in Kati where the uprising began. As news of the mutiny spread, hundreds of protesters gathered at Bamako's Independence Monument to demand Keïta's resignation. Protesters also set a building belonging to the Ministry of Justice ablaze.  \nAt the time, it was not clear how many soldiers took part in the coup, who initiated it or who would now take charge.  \n## Aftermath  \n<image>Assimi Goïta, surrounded by members of the National Committee for the Salvation of the People, 19 August 2020\nPresident Keïta resigned around midnight, while also dissolving the government and parliament. \"I want no blood to be spilled to keep me in power,\" he added. Five colonels appeared in the TV broadcast to the nation, led by Colonel Assimi Goïta. They called themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People. The bodies of four people killed by gunfire and about 15 wounded, all likely hit by stray bullets, were brought into one of the city's main hospitals, said Elhadj Djimé Kanté, a spokesman for the hospital union. The coup leaders denied that anyone had been killed, but soldiers were constantly firing in the air, cheered on by crowds of young people.  \nMilitary leaders had ordered closure of all border crossings and imposed a night-time curfew. \"As of today, 19 August 2020, all air and land borders are closed until further notice. A curfew is in place from 21:00 to 05:00 until further notice,\" Col-Major Ismaël Wagué, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Malian Air Force, said in a televised address. He also invited opposition groups to talks for fresh elections.  \nOpposition member Mahmoud Dicko announced that he is leaving politics as a result of a meeting between him and some of the soldiers that took part in the mutiny.  \nCoup leaders promised new elections within a \"reasonable timeline,\" without specifying what that meant.  \nKeïta left the country in September for medical treatment in the United Arab Emirates. Keïta, 75 years old, was originally hospitalised in the capital a few days before leaving.\n<image>Ismaël Wagué (left) and Malick Diaw, 7 September 2020\nExperts chosen by Mali's new military leaders have proposed a two-year interim government led by a president chosen by them, despite calls by Mali's neighbors for elections within a year. They suggest that the soldiers behind the coup nominate the interim president and vice president and propose the interim president choose the prime minister. Under the draft, the president would be from the civil or military sectors. The nominee must be between the ages of 35 and 75 and would not be allowed to run for election at the end of the transition. Right after the coup, military leaders promised to reinstate a civilian government and hold elections within a relatively short timeframe.  \nOn 12 September 2020, the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP) agreed to an 18-month political transition to civilian rule.  \nOn 21 September 2020 Bah Ndaw was named interim president by a group of 17 electors, with Goïta being appointed vice president. The government is supposed to preside over an interim period of 18 months. A spokesperson for political-religious leader Mahmoud Dicko praised his nomination as president. Leaders of the M5-RFP, active since the 2020 Malian protests, also signalled support. On 25 September the government was inaugurated.  \nOn 18 January 2021, the transitional government announced that the CNSP had been disbanded. Although the initial agreement in September 2020 had stated that the CNSP junta would be dissolved as soon as the transitional government came to power, this had not yet taken place.\n\n## International reaction  \nRepresentatives of several countries condemned the coup, as did representatives of the African Union, European Union, and United Nations. Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, a country which has been involved in fighting an Islamist insurgency in its former colony since 2013, called for power to be returned to civilians and for arrested leaders to be freed. The United States cut off military aid to Mali on 21 August 2020.  \nThe United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution condemning the coup and calling on the soldiers to return to their barracks and release all detainees without delay. Amnesty International also called for the release of the detainees. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) imposed sanctions on Mali and called on neighbouring states to close their land and air borders.  \nOn 25 August 2020, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie suspended Mali from membership and called for the immediate release of Keïta.  \nOn 7 September 2020 at a summit in Niamey, Niger, regional bloc ECOWAS gave the Malian military rulers a deadline of 15 September to appoint a new civilian President and Prime Minister.\n\nQuestion: Which individual was appointed as the vice president following the political transition in Mali after the events depicted in these images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Cafe Gurzuf  \nCafe Gurzuf (Кафе Гурзуф) is a painting by Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov (Алекса́ндр Никола́евич Самохва́лов; 1894–1971), Russian artist, regarded as one of the founders and brightest representative of the Socialist Realism style. The painting depicts a view of a summer cafe in Gurzuf, Crimea, in the middle of the 1950s.  \n## History  \n<image>Alexander Samokhvalov\nSamokhvalov is known in Soviet art for his portraits of typical young Soviet people of the 1930s (\"Girl in a T-shirt\", 1932, \"Metrostroevka with a drill\", 1937) as well as a monumental compositions (\"Militarized Komsomol\", 1933; \"Sergei Kirov takes parade athletes\", 1935; the monumental panel \"Soviet Sport\", 1936). They embodied the typical image of contemporary youth. The picture Cafe Gurzuf continues this theme.  \nSamokhvalov painted the present work in the mid-1950s at the zenith of his career. Not long beforehand, he had married his young wife Maria Alekseevna Kleschar (1915–2000), who became his muse and faithful assistant. Captivated by her beauty and youthfulness, Samokhvalov found her to be a source of true inspiration. The present work conveys the artist’s fascination with beauty and youth, as depicted by the central seated figure, for which Samokhvalov’s wife served as a model for the central female figure (a young woman at a table in a pink blouse, studying a menu). The graceful inclination of her head and the curve of her shoulders evince her delicate beauty.\n<image>Portrait of Maria Kleschar-Samokhvalov. 1953\nIn addition to artistic value, the picture has memorial and documentary value. This picture was painted by the artist in one of his visits to Gurzuf, where from 1950 to 1960 he repeatedly rested with his wife on the creative base of Russian artists at the former summer residence of Konstantin Korovin. A model for another female figure of the first plan from the left in a yellow dress with a red bag over his arm going up the steps became Lydia Timoshenko (1903–1976), artist and a wife of Yevgeny Kibrik (1906–1978), People's artist of the USSR.  \nPortrayed on the left in a blue suit and straw hat is Samokhvalov’s friend, the artist Evgeny Kibrik, who in 1920s was a student of Pavel Filonov, as well as Samkhvalov himself, also in a straw hat and just visible over Kibrik’s shoulder.  \nSamokhvalov since the 1920s was familiar with Lydia Tymoshenko and Yevgeny Kibrik and maintained friendship with them. In the 1920s, together with Tymoshenko, he was a member of the Leningrad association \"Circle of Artists\" (Krug Khudozhnikov) (1926–1932). The first husband of Lydia Timoshenko was artist David Zagoskin (1900–1942), who from 1926 to 1930 was also a member of the \"Circle of Artists\".  \nThe optimism and joy of the scene stem from the overall mood during the Thaw of the post-Stalinist period and is conveyed by Samokhvalov in the picture.\n\n## Exhibitions and publications  \nLydia Timoshenko. 1920s  \nCafe Gurzuf was first exhibited in 1960 at the grand Annual Exhibition of works by the leningrad artists of 1960 in the Exhibition Halls of the Leningrad Union of Artists.  \nIn 1963 Cafe Gurzuf was shown at the first solo exhibition of Samokhvalov in Leningrad in the Exhibition Halls of the Leningrad Union of Artists dedicated to the seventieth anniversary of the artist.  \nAfter Samokhvalov's death the painting was kept by his widow until the early 1990s when it was sold to a private collector.  \nIn 1994, after a long break time Cafe Gurzuf was shown again in the Leningrad Union of Artists at the exhibition of The Paintings of 1950-1980s by the Leningrad School artists.  \nIn 2012 the painting was exhibited in \"Manezh\" Central Exhibition Hall on The Art Fair devoted to 80th Anniversary of Saint-Petersburg Union of Artists. It was reproduced in the exhibition catalog.  \nIn 2007 Cafe Gurzuf was published in the book Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School by Sergei V. Ivanov, in Russian and English.  \nThe history of this painting was described in the article by S. Ivanov, dedicated to the wife of the artist and published in 2015 to her centenary anniversary.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true based on the information provided about the images?\nChoice list: \nA. The central seated figure in the painting \"Cafe Gurzuf\" was modeled after Samokhvalov's friend, the artist Evgeny Kibrik.\nB. The central seated figure in the painting \"Cafe Gurzuf\" was modeled after Samokhvalov's wife, Maria Alekseevna Kleschar.\nC. Lydia Timoshenko, who was portrayed in the painting \"Cafe Gurzuf,\" was the first wife of the artist David Zagoskin, who was not a member of the \"Circle of Artists\".\nD.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Performance archaeology  \nPerformance archaeology is a subset of archaeological theory. Developers of this theory include Michael Shanks, Mike Pearson and Julian Thomas who in the 1990s at University of Wales, Lampeter began formulating concepts which view the social aspect of performance along with the artistic nature of theatre together through an interdisciplinary lens as \"an integrated approach to recording, writing and illustrating the material past\" thereby marrying the academic with the artistic. Performance archaeology has further expanded in the last decade upon the theories of presence. Geoff Bailey states that \"because we believe that the present is known or knowable better than the past, we must seek our inspiration in studies of present phenomena and our concepts and theories from authorities on the present.\" Michael Shanks along with Ian Hodder, Christopher Witmore, Gabriella Giannachi and Nick Kaye have recently expanded the theory further by calling for cooperation within the humanities and studying transdisciplinary research from archaeologists who are encouraged to become storytellers in order to more diversely analyze the engagement of the actor, the audience, the things and the space in which they perform by using an 'ecology of practices'. The theory of performance archaeology aims to give researchers a multi temporal link to the antiquated through studying the processual nature of \"performance of presence\" which is entangled within the'multipleness' of time. Echoing theories posited by Martin Heidegger, the processual and temporal natures of performance are phenomenologically entwined with the experiences of the performers and audience. Stories are preserved by memory through performance. These performances can be seen both in the archaeological record as well in modern enactments or rituals. The landscape itself is an integral portion of performance memory. Performance archaeology sets itself apart from performance history by directing focus not toward the past itself but instead toward what has become of the past by taking an ethnoarchaeological approach of analyzing the 'archaeology of present' cultures which allows for a richer interpretation of past performance. Performance archaeology takes a cross-disciplinary approach with'social archaeology' to studying the things, narratives or artifacts, that remain of ancient theatre, music, dance, art history and oral tradition in order to'model the past'. The following examples illustrate components that might aptly demonstrate aspects of performance archaeology.  \n## Oral Cultures  \nOral cultures lacking text experience performance through epic poetry, storytelling and ritual passed down and circulated by elders, shamans and storytellers. Performance archaeology joins these experiences with material objects and geographic as well as architectural locales in order to analyze the archaic. Oral tradition utilizes bards and griots as singers of stories which are set to music in order to better retain the memory of their tales through song.  \n<image>197x197px\n\n\n### Ancient Percussion Instruments (Idiophones)  \nAncient idiophones were instruments intended to \"support man's natural feeling for dance and rhythm\" and included clappers, scrapers, rattles, sistra, cymbals and bells and have been found in both ancient Mesopotamia as well as ancient Egypt. The sistra has been linked to ancient performances associated with the goddesses Bastet, Sekhmet, and Hathor and were used in ceremonies for warding off evil spirits.  \n### Ancient Drums (Membranophones)  \nDrums are prevalent among the Sumerians, Babylonian and Hittites, but rarely found among the Egyptians. Drumming with sticks was a technique not introduced into Mesopotamia or Egypt until the later Roman invasion in the 1st century CE.  \n### Ancient Wind Instruments (Aerophones)  \nFlutes, oboes, horns, trumpets and pan pipes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt while clarinets are indigenous to Egypt alone where they may have also been called by the Arabic zummara. The organ originated in 3rd century BCE Alexandrian Egypt by fusing a pan pipe with a keyboard. 250x250px  \n### Ancient Stringed Instruments (Chordophones)  \nLyres of Ur have been found throughout what is modern-day Iraq at the Royal Cemetery at Ur \"perhaps intended to provide melodic accompaniment for the dead\" that date back to the 3rd millennium BCE. Sumerian lyres tend to be in the shape of an animal's head with the supporting sides mimicking animal horns.  \nIn Ancient Greece a lyre made of a tortoise shell was referred to as a chelys can be found on hydriai pots dating back as far as the 8th century BCE. These instruments played a daily role in child-related activities as well as during multiple performances such as symposia, weddings and komoi and were related to the god Hermes as referenced by Homer.  \nLyres were not indigenous to Egypt and did not become popular until centuries after being introduced by a Syrian nomad.  \nHarps have been linked to ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian and Persian cultures, but were most popular in Egypt.  \n## Ancient Theatrical Performance  \n### Ancient Egypt  \nThe earliest form of theatre was thought to have begun as early as the 19th century BCE in Abydos, Egypt in religious ceremonies known as 'Passion Plays' whereby priests annually and ritually reenacted the Osiris myth in performances that traveled with Osiris' sacred barque on a roundtrip journey from his temple to his tomb and back. This processional festival brought travelers from the entirety of Egypt. Those who could afford to erected monuments to themselves along the route so that even in the afterlife they would still be able to participate in the festival. Performance in Egypt persisted for another millennia as described by the Rhind mortuary papyri which records the burial ceremonies of Menthesuphis and his wife who perished circa 9 BCE entailing a \"dramatic performance, with the priests assuming the roles of the gods.\" In these instances ritual is enacted through performance in order to join the realms of the living with the dead and also to create a space where the worlds of the living and dead could simultaneously merge as \"this complex festival culture connect(s) heaven, the earth, and the world of the dead\". Recurring festival performances were held annually or seasonally. As festival culture emerged, so too did the ritual performances or 'festival plays' that served the purpose of both associating the ruling king with the gods as exemplified in the Luxor feast which was annually performed as a \"cultic affirmation of the king as son of god (Amun)\", as well as during the Festival of Valley when the king associated himself with his forefathers in the cult of the 'ancestor gods' in order to \"assure himself of their blessings as the legitimate son of his bodily ancestors\". Traces of the Osiris Myth as performance archaeology have endured and can be seen in modern stories such as Hamlet and The Lion King.  \n### India  \nIn Classical India, theatre was used as a way to both provide a source of entertainment as well as to relay moral advice from their epic poetry. The Natya Shastra is a Sanskrit text dating back to the 5th century describing the performing arts. Episodes of the performances are depicted in sixty-two reliefs found within Prambanan temple located in Java. Music, dance and theatre were all closely interwoven within both the Hindu and Buddhist cultures. A scene from kabuki stage (1885?)  \n### Japan  \nKabuki  \n### Greece  \nAncient Greek tragedy has been linked to rituals stemming from the cult of Cult of Dionysus.  \n## Ancient dance  \nTomb of the Dancers, wall painting. 17th Dynasty, Thebes.  \nMusicians and dancers played important roles in ancient Egyptian performance. Elite women in ancient Egypt adorned their hips with trinkets including not only aesthetically pleasing ornamental gold, shells and jewels, but also noise-making trinkets that were thought to both ward off evil spirits and invoke the goddess Hathor and appeal to her sexual nature in order to promote fertility. Modern belly dance is thus a derivative of this older Egyptian practice. Through the archaeological record dancers can be seen in artwork such as the Tomb of the Dancers painting in Thebes.  \n<image>Procession of performers welcome child heir. Bonampak, Mexico.\nViolent war performances were reenacted in Mesoamerica by elaborately plumed war dancers. The representation of maize was personified by human/plant hybrid models which were utilized for ritual purposes. Dramatic enactments of this nature are presumed to have been used for the purpose of sympathetic magic in order to win in battle in the former instance, as well as to resurrect the spirit of the vegetation each Spring in the latter. A theatrical performance was reconstructed in Guatemala in 1543 CE that incorporated music along with the Dance of Hunahpu and Xbalanque, the Maya Hero Twins, which portrayed their descent into and resurrection from Xibalba. Theatrical performances also frequently incorporated both music and dance into a procession as exemplified on limestone murals found in Bonampak, Mexico. Here musicians playing drums, rattles and turtle shells accompany actors wearing bizarre costumes in an elaborate ceremony welcoming a child heir to the throne. Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions show people posed in \"highly-stylized gestures...explicitly labeled in accompanying text as 'dance'\" and are thought of as a form of sign language. Instruments used in Maya culture such as horns, turtle shells, drums and rattles can be found in their visual art.  \nAlessandra Lopez y Royo analogizes dance to poetry describing the karanas, or dance movements artistically portrayed on the temple walls, as the'sentences' left for us to re-embody the 'vocabulary' of the dance. 'Contemporary dance' of Indian performance arts on the other hand is a \"distinct genre\" and can be interpreted as the product of Western or 'non-traditional' influence.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a representation of a cultural performance that includes both music and dance as a form of procession?\nChoice list: \nA. Image 1: A solitary bronze figure holding an object.\nB. Image 2: A mural showing a group of performers with instruments and elaborate costumes.\nC.

He was a member of the Kapitsa family, a scientific dynasty in Russia.  \nKapitsa was the first to suggest the existence of Lake Vostok in the region of Vostok Station in Antarctica, based on seismic soundings of the thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet. These measures were obtained during the Soviet Antarctic Expeditions, in four of which Kapitsa participated. The discovery of Lake Vostok was one of the last major geographic discoveries.  \n## Early life  \nAndrey Kapitsa's father was Nobel Prize-winning physicist Pyotr Kapitsa, and his maternal grandfather was mathematician and naval engineer Aleksey Krylov. Pyotr Kapitsa's sons Sergey and Andrey were born in Cambridge, United Kingdom, where their father was conducting research.  \nAndrey graduated from Moscow State University, Faculty of Geography, in 1953. He worked in the Laboratory of Experimental Geomorphology at the faculty since.  \n## Antarctic research and discovery of Lake Vostok  \n<image>Location of Lake Vostok in East Antarctica\nIn 1958 Kapitsa defended his Candidate of Sciences thesis \"Morphology of East Antarctic Ice Sheet\" («Морфология ледникового покрова Восточной Антарктиды»), and in 1968 he defended his Doctor of Science thesis \"Subglacial relief of Antarctica\" («Подлёдный рельеф Антарктиды»). Kapitsa was a participant in four Soviet Antarctic Expeditions between 1955 and 1964.  \nAt the end of the 19th century Russian scientist Peter Kropotkin proposed the idea of the existence of fresh water under Antarctic ice sheets. He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could increase the temperature at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the point where the ice would melt. Kropotkin's theory was later developed by Russian glaciologist I.A Zotikov, who wrote his PhD thesis on this subject in 1967.  \nAndrey Kapitsa used seismic soundings in the region of Vostok Station made during the Soviet Antarctic Expeditions in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet, discovering two spikes of reflection (one from bedrock and another from the sediment layer). Kapitsa was the first to suggest the existence of a subglacial lake in this region, which came to be known as Lake Vostok. The lake was named after Vostok Station, which in turn had been named after the Vostok, the 900-ton corvette of the discoverer of Antarctica, Russian explorer Admiral Fabian von Bellingshausen. The word восток means \"east\" in Russian, and the name of the station and the lake also reflects the fact that they are located in the East of Antarctica.\n<image>Satellite image of Lake Vostok by NASA\nBy 1993, the research of Russian and British scientists confirmed the existence of the lake, and subsequent research established its features. Other subglacial lakes were also discovered.\n\n## Later career  \nKapitsa was the dean of his alma mater MSU Faculty of Geography in 1966–1970. In 1967–1969 he was the leader of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Expedition in the East Africa. He was elected into the ranks of the Academy in 1970 and was honored with a 1971 USSR State Prize and 1972 MSU's Dmitry Anuchin Prize for the creation of the Atlas of Antarctica. He supported the theory of natural causes behind the Antarctic ozone hole as well as the theory of natural reasons behind global warming.  \nKapitsa died in Moscow on 2 August 2011 at the age of 80.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Dave Matthews Band Chicago River incident  \n<image>Kinzie Street Bridge (front), the location of the incident\nOn August 8, 2004, a tour bus belonging to the Dave Matthews Band dumped an estimated kg of human waste from the bus's blackwater tank through the Kinzie Street Bridge in Chicago onto a passenger sightseeing boat sailing in the Chicago River below.  \nAs part of a 2005 legal settlement, the band agreed to pay $200,000 to environmental protection and other projects (r=-3). The band also donated $100,000 to two groups that protect the river and the surrounding area (r=-3). The band's bus driver, Stefan Wohl, pleaded guilty to dumping the waste in April 2005.\n\n## Background  \nThe Dave Matthews Band had booked rooms at the Peninsula Hotel of 108 E. Superior Street for a two-night show at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin. The incident occurred between the first and second night of the concert. The band booked five buses for its show; Stefan Wohl drove the bus of the band's violinist Boyd Tinsley.  \nDuring warm months, the Chicago Architecture Center offers a boat tour of the buildings along the Chicago River. The boats have open-roof seating, where passengers sit during the tour.  \n<image>The riveted grate surface of the bridge allows liquids to pass through. The Chicago River is visible through the holes in the grate.\nMost Chicago bridges feature riveted grating, which is used for its strength and anti-slip properties. Riveted grating allows rain, snow, and other liquids to pass through, removing the need for complicated drainage systems or to salt the bridge deck during snow, and assuring it does not ice over in wintry weather.\n\n## Incident  \nOn Sunday, August 8, 2004, at 1:18 p.m., Wohl was alone in Tinsley's bus and driving to a downtown hotel when he emptied the bus' blackwater tank as it crossed the metal grates of the Kinzie Street bridge.  \nPassenger boat Chicago's Little Lady was hosting the 1 p.m. Chicago Architecture Foundation tour of the Chicago River. While passing under the bridge, the boat received the full contents of the tank on the seats of its open-roof terrace. Roughly two-thirds of the 120 passengers aboard the tour boat were soaked. The boat immediately returned to its dock, where all passengers were issued refunds. Five passengers went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for testing. According to the Illinois Attorney General, passengers aboard included persons with disabilities, elderly, a pregnant woman, a small child, and an infant. The filing describes the incident:  \nThe boat's deck was swabbed by its crew, and service was resumed for its scheduled 3 p.m. tour.  \n## Aftermath  \nImmediately following the incident, the Chicago Police Department said they were investigating the incident but did not yet consider it a crime. On August 9, the Chicago Architecture Foundation released a statement that a witness had recorded license plate information, which they had turned over to the police as evidence. On August 10, bus driver Jerry Fitzpatrick, who drove for the band, was identified as the owner of the bus's license plate. In a phone interview, Fitzpatrick denied to a Chicago Tribune reporter that he had dumped the waste, asserting that he was parked in front of the band's hotel at the time. A publicist for the Dave Matthews Band issued a statement saying the band's management had determined that every one of its buses was parked at the time of the incident.  \nFitzpatrick, who was in Effingham, Illinois, at the time, instructed Sgt. Paul Gardner of the Effingham Police Department to inspect the bus's septic tank to prove that he could not have emptied it. Gardner reported to the Chicago Tribune over Fitzpatrick's cell phone that he had inspected the tank, and that it was nearly full.  \nState prosecutors worked with a nearby fitness gym, the East Bank Club, to identify the offending bus based on the gym's security videotapes. On August 24, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed a $70,000 lawsuit against Wohl, alleging that he was responsible for the dumping. Wohl denied dumping the waste, and was supported by the band. On August 25, Mayor Richard M. Daley held a press conference in which he released the videotape used as evidence. Daley, himself a fan of the band, expressed his belief that the dumping was \"absolutely unacceptable\".  \nIn March 2005, Wohl pleaded guilty to reckless conduct and discharging contaminants to cause water pollution. The Dave Matthews Band did not immediately apologize for previously supporting Wohl. He was sentenced to 150 hours of community service, fined $10,000 to be paid to Friends of the Chicago River, an environmental organization, and received 18 months probation. The Dave Matthews Band donated $50,000 to the Chicago Park District, $50,000 to Friends of the Chicago River, and paid the State of Illinois $200,000 in settlement. The Dave Matthews Band agreed to keep a log when its buses empty their septic tanks.  \nIt is believed that Wohl did not realize that there was a boat underneath the bridge when he dumped the waste. No passengers suffered any long-lasting physical health effects from having the waste dumped on them.  \nOn August 8, 2023, the Riot Fest Historical Society attached a plaque to the Kinzie Street Bridge commemorating the 19th anniversary of the incident.\n\nQuestion: What feature of the Kinzie Street Bridge played a role in the incident involving the Dave Matthews Band's tour bus in 2004?\nChoice list: \nA.

He became President of Queens' College at the University of Cambridge from 1529 to 1537, and toward the end of his life, was installed Canon of Windsor at Windsor Castle.\n\n## Life  \n<image>Exeter Cathedral, where Simon Heynes assumed the role of Dean of Exeter\nHaynes was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1516, was elected fellow of his college in 1516, proceeded M.A. in 1519, and had a title for orders from Queens' College in February 1521. He took part in the expulsion of Dr. John Jennins from the presidency of Queens' in 1518, and in 1528 was himself elected president. Being empowered by the college to make bargains and covenants at his discretion, he alienated some of the estates belonging to the society.  \nOn 28 November 1528 Haynes was instituted to the rectory of Barrow, Suffolk. He was one of the delegates appointed by the senate to make a determination as to the king's divorce in 1529–30; commenced D.D. in 1531, and in 1532–3 and 1533–4 served the office of Vice-chancellor. On 23 May 1533 he attested Archbishop Thomas Cranmer's instrument of divorce at Dunstable, implicating Catherine of Aragon, and in 1534 was admitted vicar of Stepney, Middlesex. During that year he and Bishop John Skip, the chaplain of Queen Anne Boleyn, were selected by the court to preach at Cambridge against papal supremacy.  \nIn 1535 Haynes was sent with diplomat Christoper Mount, an agent of Thomas Cromwell, to France as an Ambassador. The aim was to convince reformer Philip Melanchthon, a collaborator of Martin Luther, to come back to England. The mission eventually failed but they kept good contact. At the end of the same year he was instituted to the rectory of Fulham, Middlesex, and on 24 December was installed canon of Windsor at Windsor Castle.  \nOn 16 July 1537 he was elected Dean of Exeter, and in that capacity he attended the baptism of Prince Edward Tudor; and soon afterwards resigned the presidency of Queens' College. A letter in condemnation of the bill of the Six Articles, addressed by him to a member of parliament, is printed in John Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials.  \nIn 1538 Haynes and Edmund Bonner, the  Bishop of London, were sent to Spain, and joined Sir Thomas Wyatt, the Ambassador there. Offended by Wyatt's treatment of them, they later charged him with holding traitorous correspondence with Cardinal Reginald Pole and speaking disrespectfully of the king. Haynes signed the decree of 9 July 1540 invalidating the marriage of Henry VIII with Anne of Cleves, and on the following 17 Dec. the king made him one of the first prebendaries of Westminster.  \nHaynes was a visitor of the university of Oxford, the college of Windsor, and Exeter Cathedral, and one of the commissioners against the Anabaptists. He also assisted in the compilation of the first English liturgy. He died in October 1552, leaving by his wife Joan Waleron, daughter of Nicholas Waleron, (who then married Archbishop William May) two sons, Joseph and Simon.\n\n\nQuestion: Which role did Simon Heynes assume at the location shown in Image 2?\nChoice list: \nA.

The group has performed on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews as well as on local radio stations such as 93.7 The Bull. The group competed in the international finals of the 2016 ICCA competition. They have progressed to the regional level of multiple ICCA competitions and the final four of a national competition to sing with Andy Grammer. They have toured nationally, opened for Ben Folds and Straight No Chaser, received a number of CARA nominations, and have been included on a number of national a cappella compilation albums.  \n## History  \nThe Mosaic Whispers was founded in 1991 by a group of students and first performed together at Washington University's Thurtene Carnival. The original roster included P. Daniel Newman, Jason Coryell, Brian Stephenson, Liz Radford, Josh Einsohn, Devorah Rosner, and Lora Norback, with the group holding auditions in the fall of 1991. Many alumni return and join current students at the group's annual spring concert, known as Splash of Color.  \nThe group has appeared on several compilation a cappella albums, including an appearance on the 2008 Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!. The Whispers were selected after submitting a video of the group performing Folds' song \"Still Fighting It\" to Ben Folds' university a cappella competition.  \nThe group released their 10th studio album, Wavelength, in the spring of 2015, and their first EP, ICCA 2016: The Extended Cuts, in the spring of 2017. Their most recent album, titled Oasis, was released in 2018.  \nOne notable alumna is Eliotte Henderson ('10) who has toured internationally as a member of Taylor Swift's band.  \n## Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!  \nThe Mosaic Whispers were selected to be featured on the album after submitting a video of the group performing Folds' song \"Still Fighting It\" to Ben Folds' university a cappella competition. Reviews for their rendition of \"Still Fighting It\" were positive, with the Norwich Bulletin praising their performance.  \n<image>Mosaic Whispers and Ben Folds take a break from recording \"Still Fighting It\" for Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!\n\n\n## Andy Grammer Competition  \nIn Spring 2012, The Whispers reached the final four in a competition to sing with Andy Grammer. The competition, which was 12 days long, consisted of submitting three performance videos, including two Andy Grammer songs. The Whispers arranged and learned the song Fine By Me in 8 hours for their final video submission. To gain votes, the Whispers got support of both the WashU newspaper Studlife and the St. Louis Metro social media staff. While they won the popular vote (consisting of Facebook Likes, Tweets, and user account votes) in their final round, they ultimately lost to the professional a cappella group Six Appeal, who garnered the votes of both TopBlip and Grammer himself.  \n## International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella  \n<image>Senior William Skubish solos on Harry Styles' \"Music for a Sushi Restaurant\" at the 2023 Midwest Semifinal. Photo by William Urdahl.\nThe group regularly competes in the Varsity Vocals International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA). In the spring of 2016, they were the Midwest Champions and advanced to the Finals round at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, NY. There, they performed their award-winning set which included their arrangements of \"Smooth\" by Santana, \"Elastic Heart\" by Sia, \"Tremors\" by SOHN, and \"Uptown Funk\" by Bruno Mars. They also advanced to the Semifinals round of the competition in the spring of 2017. Before the competition was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the group placed first at the 2020 Midwest Quarterfinal, where Samara Lillioja was awarded both Outstanding Arrangement and Outstanding Soloist for Yebba's \"My Mind\". Most recently, Whispers won the 2023 Midwest Quarterfinal, where Natalie Feldstein was awarded Outstanding Choreography and Noah Maguigad was awarded Outstanding Arrangement, both for the entire set. They then advanced to the Midwest Semifinal, where Eli Cohen was awarded Outstanding Vocal Percussion and the group was awarded 3rd place.\n\n## Notable performances  \nIn Spring 2012, the Whispers sang \"Change the World\" for Bill Nye and Washington University's Board of Trustees, as a part of the dedication to WUSTL's new Earth, Planetary, and Space Science Center.  \nRecently, the Whispers sang for the launch of Washington University's Leading Together Campaign, a multibillion-dollar fundraiser to aid the expanding university. They also sang to help the Boatload of Toys fundraiser, a charity event for St. Louis children hosted by 93.7 St. Louis, with Mason and Remy. They have also sung for the WUSTL Founder's Day ball on multiple occasions, which has been attended by Robert Gates, John Huntsman, and Anderson Cooper.  \n## Albums  \n* Watercolors (1994)  \n* * I Can't Make You Love Me (track 3) has been reviewed as \"a sharply performed, smartly arranged, and emotionally stirring number that made substantial improvements on the original recording.\"  \n* Three A.M.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Lu Xiaopeng  \nLu Xiaopeng (w=Lu Hsiao-p'eng; 19 August 1920 – 16 October 2000) was a Chinese aircraft designer who spent most of his career at Hongdu Aviation (formerly Nanchang Aircraft). He was the chief designer of the Nanchang Q-5 supersonic attack aircraft, one of the most widely deployed aircraft of the PLA Air Force. He also designed the Nanchang J-12, the world's lightest supersonic fighter, which however never entered service. He was an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.  \n## Early life and career  \nLu was born on 19 August 1920 in Shanghai, Republic of China, with his ancestral home in Changzhou, Jiangsu. He studied at the Jiangsu Provincial High School from 1935 to 1937, and then entered the National Central University to study aeronautical engineering. After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the university was exiled in Chongqing, China's wartime capital, and he graduated in 1941.  \nIn 1942, he received further training at the Republic of China Air Force's mechanics school in Chengdu. A year later, he was assigned to work for the No. 2 Aircraft Manufacturing Factory in Nanchuan, Chongqing, as an aircraft designer. In December 1944, he was sent to the United States to work at the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, where he participated in the design of shipborne jet fighters. He was then sent to Britain to work as a designer at the Gloster Aircraft Company.  \n## Early PRC and the Shenyang JJ-1  \n<image>A Shenyang JJ-1 jet trainer\nIn August 1949, just before the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Lu returned to China via Hong Kong to work for the new  government. From 1949 to 1951, Lu worked on constructing airports in the East China Military Region. After the Korean War broke out, Lu was transferred to Beijing Nanyuan Airport to service military and transport aircraft in support of the war effort.  \nIn 1956, he was transferred to the aircraft design office of Shenyang Aircraft Factory (112 Factory), working under director Xu Shunshou. He was one of the main designers of the Shenyang JJ-1 trainer, the first jet aircraft designed in China. Besides Xu Shushou and deputy director Huang Zhiqian, Lu was the only person in the development team who had had aircraft design experience. The project began in October 1956, and the plane took its maiden flight less than two years later, on 26 July 1958. The development cycle was less than half that of similar planes designed in Japan and Czechoslovakia and the performance was superior.\n\n## Designing the Nanchang Q-5 attack aircraft  \n<image>A Nanchang A-5 (Q-5) of the Bangladesh Air Force\nIn 1958, Lu was transferred to the Hongdu Aircraft Factory (320 Factory) in Nanchang, and appointed chief designer of the Nanchang Q-5  supersonic attack aircraft. However, because of economic difficulties during the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese government decided to cancel the project in August 1961. Lu petitioned the government to save the project, and was allowed to continue his research, but his staff was reduced from more than 100 members to just 14.  \nWith his skeleton crew, Lu spent two years to build a stationary prototype aircraft. This achievement caught the attention of Minister Sun Zhiyuan (孙志远) of the Third Ministry of Machine Building and Cao Lihuai (曹里怀), Deputy Commander of the PLA Air Force. They ordered a full resumption of the project, and the Q-5 completed its maiden flight on 4 June 1965. After further testing and improvement, the Q-5 was mass produced in 1968 to equip the Air Force. It was China's first self-designed attack aircraft that was mass produced and widely deployed. In January 1972, a modified Q-5 aircraft (Q5-A) was used to conduct a hydrogen bomb test at Lop Nur.  \nIn 1981, Lu was again named chief designer for updating the Q-5 with an improved range. The redesigned Q-5, with seven different models, became one of the most widely used aircraft in the Chinese Air Force. It was also exported to foreign countries. In 1985, the Q-5 project won the Special Prize of the State Science and Technology Progress Award.\n\n## Designing the Nanchang J-12 fighter  \n<image>A Nanchang J-12 on display at the Chinese Aviation Museum\nIn the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and Arab countries, the Soviet-made aircraft performed poorly, and the PLA Air Force wanted a new lightweight fighter to replace its Shenyang J-6, which was the Chinese-made version of the Soviet MiG 19. In 1969, Lu was tasked with designing the Nanchang J-12 supersonic fighter. Only 17 months later, the aircraft took its first flight on 26 December 1970. The J-12 was the first fighter jet completely designed with Chinese technology and not modelled after a Soviet aircraft. It was also the lightest supersonic fighter in the world, with exceptional dexterity and evasion ability. However, its light weight also proved to be a weakness, as the limited space for missiles and fuel and the lack of a radar meant it had poor range and combat capabilities. As a result, the J-12 never entered service, but it laid a solid foundation for the future development of fighters.\n\n## Other contributions and awards  \nIn addition to designing aircraft, Lu conducted theoretical research on aerodynamics. He wrote a textbook on aircraft design in 1974, and a 400,000-word research report on fourth-generation lightweight fighters. In 1991, he was awarded the Aviation Gold Medal, the highest award in China's aviation industry. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1995.  \nLu died on 16 October 2000, at the age of 80.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following aircraft was the first jet aircraft designed in China?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Solar power in Florida  \nSolar panels on parking lot roof, Miami  \nSolar power in Florida has been increasing, as the cost of solar power systems using photovoltaics (PV) has decreased in recent years.  \nFlorida has low electricity costs compared with other states, which makes individual solar investment less attractive.  \nFlorida ranks ninth nationally in solar resource strength according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and tenth in solar generation by the Solar Energy Industries Association.  \n## Government support  \nSolar panel installation, Broward County  \nIn 2006, the State of Florida enacted the Florida Renewable Energy Technologies and Energy Efficiency Act, which provided consumers with rebates and tax credits for solar photovoltaic systems.  \nThe program was closed in 2010.  \nLater, the Florida Public Service Commission mandated that the state's large utilities offer individual solar rebates.  \nThe program opened in 2011 and was closed in 2015 after the Commission deemed it to not be cost-effective for non-solar customers.  \nIn 2008, Florida adopted a net metering rule that allows any electric utility customer generating up to 2 MW (2,000 kW) of power to use net metering, which provides a retail rate credit for kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered to the utility, rolled over from month to month, and paid out in cash by the utility once a year at the avoided cost rate.  \n<image>Solar farm at Kennedy Space Center\nThe federal Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit (income tax credit on IRS Form 5695) for residential PV and solar thermal was extended in December 2015 to remain at 30% of system cost (parts and installation) for systems put into service by the end of 2019, then 26% until the end of 2020, and then 22% until the end of 2021. It applies to a taxpayer's principal and/or second residences, but not to a property that is rented out. There is no maximum cap on the credit, and the credit can be applied toward the Alternative Minimum Tax, and any excess credit (greater than that year's tax liability) can be rolled into the following year.\n\n## Large-scale facilities  \nDesoto Solar Plant  \nIn 2009, Florida Power & Light built the state's first solar power plant, the FPL DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center.  \nAt the time, the 25-MW plant was the largest of its kind.  \nIn 2010, FPL built the world's first hybrid solar-natural gas energy center.  \nThe state's largest solar plant is the 75 MW FPL Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center, in Martin County operated by Florida Power and Light.  \nIt was the world's first hybrid solar-natural gas energy center and is a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant using solar thermal instead of photovoltaic technology.  \nNo additional CSP plants are under development in Florida, although in 2007 a 300 MW Fresnel CSP plant had been planned.  \nThe state's largest photovoltaic plant was the 25 MW DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, operated by Florida Power and Light, completed in 2009. Florida Power and Light also operates the Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center, a 10 MW photovoltaic facility near the Kennedy Space Center.  \nThe 100 MW Sorrento Solar Farm was expected to become Florida's largest photovoltaic solar farm with 40 MW of photovoltaic capacity already under construction in Lake County. However the company Blue Chip Energy became insolvent and the equipment and farm site was sold at a public auction in 2013.  \nFlorida Power and Light announced in October 2014 that it would build three more power plants by the end of 2016. The FPL Manatee Solar Energy Center is located in Manatee County at a natural gas power plant, FPL Citris Solar Energy Center is in DeSoto County, near the FPL DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, and FPL Babcock Ranch Solar Energy Center is  in Charlotte County. The three plants together generate 225 MW, approximately the same as the total solar power installed in the entire state at the time.  \nTampa Electric Company is building a 2 MW farm at the Tampa International Airport. Gulf Power Company and the U.S. military announced contracts for the construction of 3 large plants in Florida: a 50 MW project at Saufley Field in Pensacola, a 40 MW project being at Holley Field in Navarre, and a 30 MW project at Eglin Air Force Base.  \nIn April 2015, Duke Energy Florida proposed to build 500MW of solar in the next ten years.  \nSet to go live on January 1, 2018, the 20-megawatt Tallahassee Solar Farm is still currently under construction on 120 acres of the property of Tallahassee International Airport (TLH). Even though it has reached capacity a second solar farm is being planned for the city.  \nDuke Energy and Walt Disney World built a five-megawatt solar farm near Epcot Center which has been called the Walt Disney World Solar Facility, or 'Hidden Mickey'. It is visible from the air as a giant Mickey Mouse shape. It sells power to Walt Disney World. Disney World will soon be adding a new solar farm ten times larger than the Hidden Mickey farm. Reedy Creek Improvement District and Origis Energy are in agreement to build the farm on the western edge of Disney's property. It will provide renewable solar power to the Reedy Creek Improvement District and to Disney World.  \nIn April 2018, a new Florida town just north of Fort Myers called Babcock Ranch, began attempting to become fully solar-powered. Florida Power and Light partnered with town founders to build a 75-megawatt solar-generating facility that's already running. The land was purchased in 2006 and more than 90% is being preserved for wildlife. The town's developers hope its success will keep the federal government from imposing high tariffs on solar energy, and keep the energy source in private hands. Babcock Ranch developer Syd Kitson has said that Florida has done a good job of embracing solar energy.  \nTampa Electric currently has a plan to build a 350-acre solar farm in rural Pasco County which is being challenged by neighbors who oppose the project for visual aesthetic reasons. A county ordinance has been proposed restricting where solar farms can be located in the future.  \n## Solar panels  \n<image>Medium installation on South Beach roof in 2012.\nDevelopers in Florida have announced the addition of solar panels on all new homes in several subdivisions.  \nIn 2013, it was discovered that Blue Chip Energy was selling fraudulent solar panels to hundreds of consumers throughout Florida.\n\n## Statistics  \n<image>Average solar insolation\n\n\n### Potential generation  \nSolar energy is the state's most abundant energy resource and estimates have placed the state's potential at 2,902 GW, which would produce about 5,274,479 GWh, an amount much larger than the state and countries's total electricity consumption of 231,210 GWh and 4,125,060 GWh in 2010. Florida is one of only two states with no potential for conventional wind power, the other being Mississippi, and will need to either import energy from other states during overcast days and at night, or provide adequate grid energy storage. Most of the potential is from photovoltaics, which provides no storage. The state has some potential for concentrated solar power, but the potential is estimated at 0.13 GW.

Her father, Auguste Jules Arsène, was employed by the railway. As a student at the Conservatoire de Paris, she received a third medal for solfège in 1885, a first prize for opéra comique in 1886, a second singing prize in 1887 and a second prize for opéra comique in 1887.  \n<image>Mathide Auguez as Isabelle in the opera comique Turlupin (album from the Nadar workshop.

Her first important role, on 29 March 1888, was at that theatre in Madame Turlupin, an opéra comique by Ernest Guiraud, in which she played Isabelle. She then sang in le Baiser de Suzon by Herman Bemberg (premiere, role of Suzon); in Gounod's Mireille and Maillard's Les dragons de Villars. On 30 January 1889, she premiered Louis Varney's la Vénus d'Arles at the Théâtre des Nouveautés. On 11 December 1891, at the Théâtre des Variétés, she was Denise de Flavigny in Hervé's Mam'zelle Nitouche. Later at the Variétés, she played in Offenbach's les Brigands.  \nIn 1894, she gave a song recital at la Bodinière, which earned her this comment in la Caricature:  \nHer performances were frequently acclaimed by critics. For example, the Journal amusant wrote in 1910:  \nOn 10 March 1898, she married journalist and playwright Henri Lavedan.  \nAuguez died on 18 July 1955 at her home in the 6th arrondissement of Paris.

Sitting from left to right: Prime Minister Janusz Jędrzejewicz, Zofia Nałkowska, Maria Mościcka, President Ignacy Mościcki, Maria Jędrzejewicz, Wacław Sieroszewski, Leopold Staff. Standing from left: Colonel Jan Głogowski, director Skowroński, Zenon Przesmycki, Wacław Berent, Piotr Choynowski, Juliusz Kleiner, Wincenty Rzymowski, Jerzy Szaniawski, Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski, Karol Irzykowski, Tadeusz Żeleński, Tadeusz Zieliński, and Bolesław Leśmian\n\n<image>Diploma of the Polish Academy of Literature Golden laurel awarded to Kornel Makuszyński in 1935\nThe Polish Academy of Literature (Polska Akademia Literatury, PAL) was one of the most important state institutions of literary life in the Second Polish Republic, operating between 1933 and 1939 with the headquarters in Warsaw. It was founded by the decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic (Rada Ministrów RP).  \nThe academy was the highest opinion-forming authority in the country, in charge of all aspects of promoting and honoring the most outstanding contemporary achievements of Polish literature. According to its own statute, the main objective of the academy was to raise the quality level of Poland's publishing, while working in conjunction with the government efforts and NGO endeavors focused on the advancement of Polish culture and art in general. The century of foreign Partitions of Poland, ending in 1918, was marked by the forcible suppression of Polish education, language and religion under Prussian (and later German rule, see Kulturkampf), and outright Russification in the territories occupied by the Tsarist Empire, reaching its epitome under Otto von Bismarck on the one hand, and Nicholas II on the other. It resulted in staggering levels of illiteracy on Polish lands, as noted by Stefan Żeromski in 1923. PAL was called forth to reinforce the historic standards of quality, exalt the honor of Poland's literary tradition and explore the intricacies of her heritage. It was proposed for the first time by Żeromski in 1920 already, but accepted as an idea only nine years later (and five years after his death), in 1929.\n\n## Organization and the awards for contributions to literature  \nThe structure of the academy was modeled on the corresponding French Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. It consisted of 15 members chosen for life, seven of whom were selected by the Minister of Religion and Public Education. The remaining eight were proposed by the members of the first group. Notably, socialist writer and Freemason, Andrzej Strug declined the offer, upset by voices of official criticism of the movement.  \nThe academy awarded two highest national honors for contribution to the development of Polish literature: the Gold and the Silver Laurel (Złoty, and Srebrny Wawrzyn). Another prize, also widely regarded, was the Young Writer's Award, a door-opener for new and emerging talent. The honorary members included also the academy's main promoters: President of Poland Ignacy Mościcki and Marshal Józef Piłsudski.  \nAmong the members of the academy were the luminaries of Poland's literary life including its own president Wacław Sieroszewski, vicepresident Leopold Staff, secretary general Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski, and popular writers such as Wacław Berent, Piotr Choynowski, Zofia Nałkowska, Zenon Przesmycki, Karol Irzykowski, Juliusz Kleiner, Bolesław Leśmian, Karol Hubert Rostworowski, Wincenty Rzymowski, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Jerzy Szaniawski, and Tadeusz Zieliński.  \nThe composition changed after the death Choynowski (1935) and Leśmian (1937) and after the withdrawal from PAL by Rzymowski accused of plagiarism (1937), and by Rostworowski (1937) protesting against the change of government. The new members were soon appointed, including writers Ferdynand Goetel, Kornel Makuszyński, Jan Lorentowicz, and Kazimierz Wierzyński. The academy ceased to exist following the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.  \n### Epilogue  \nIn 1947 following World War II, in the Soviet-controlled Polish People's Republic, there was a discussion among some communist writers about whether to reinstate the academy. The leading proponent of Polish Stalinism from Kuźnica, Jan Kott, summarized the subject in the following way: \"The Academy is like the monarchy; if it has existed for some time, one can get used to it, just as one can get accustomed to progressive bulbar palsy.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# EPassport gates  \n<image>ePassport gates in Heathrow Airport (Terminal 4)\n\n<image>ePassport gates in Heathrow Airport (Terminal 5)\n\n<image>ePassport gates in Gatwick Airport (South Terminal)\nePassport gates are automated self-service barriers (an automated border control system) operated by the UK Border Force and located at immigration checkpoints in arrival halls in some airports across the UK and at the juxtaposed controls in international railway terminals abroad, offering an alternative to using desks staffed by immigration officers. The gates use facial recognition technology to verify the traveller's identity against the data stored in the chip in their biometric passport, as well as run the data against numerous databases to determine if the traveller is a security risk.\n\n## Eligibility  \nBritish citizens, European Union, European Economic Area and Swiss citizens who are aged 10 or over and holding biometric passports are eligible to use the ePassport gates. ePassport gates are usually marked with this symbol (20px). The ePassport gates do not, however, accept national identity cards. If the holder's nationality is shown as a British overseas territories citizen; a British overseas citizen; a British subject; a British national (overseas); or a British protected person then the holder will not be able to use the ePassport gates.  \ncitizens of the following countries holding valid biometric passports became eligible to use ePassport gates, provided that they are aged either 18 and over or 12 and over travelling with an adult:  \nUpon successfully using the ePassport gates, citizens of the above countries entering as a visitor are granted 6 months' leave to enter (subject to conditions prohibiting employment and recourse to public funds) and do not receive a passport stamp or any written notice/endorsement. However, citizens of the above countries who wish to enter the UK with a Tier 5 (Temporary Worker - Creative and Sporting) Certificate of Sponsorship (for up to 3 months) or on a permitted paid engagement are not eligible to use the ePassport gates, as a passport stamp must be obtained in these situations.  \nIn addition, citizens from the following countries/territories who are enrolled in the Registered Traveller Service can also use ePassport gates, provided that they hold valid biometric passports and are aged either 18 and over or 12 and over travelling with an adult:  \nUpon successfully using the ePassport gates, citizens of the above countries who are enrolled in the 'Registered Traveller Service' and entering as a visitor are granted 6 months' leave to enter (subject to conditions prohibiting employment and recourse to public funds) without receiving a passport stamp or any written notice/endorsement.  \nPractical difficulties may be faced by non-British/EU/EEA/Swiss citizens who have used an ePassport gate to enter the UK as they do not receive a passport stamp evidencing leave to enter. For example, landlords are legally required to check the immigration status of tenants before the start of a tenancy agreement. The Home Office advises that where a prospective tenant is a non-visa national who used an ePassport gate to enter the UK, the landlord should accept any documentary evidence (such as a ticket or boarding pass) that establishes the date of arrival in the UK within the past 6 months.  \n## Use  \nTo use the ePassport gates, the traveller must have a biometric passport from the United Kingdom and certain other countries (these ePassports have the biometric logo on the front cover). The ePassport gate scanner reads all the information contained in the chip inside the passport, while a camera takes a picture of the traveller which is then compared against their passport photo using a facial recognition algorithm. Once the data verification and facial recognition process is complete, doors will automatically either open, signifying that the traveller is permitted to enter the country, or remain closed and a stop icon illuminate, demonstrating that the traveller has failed the security checks and will personally meet with immigration officials.  \n## Availability  \nAt present, ePassport gates are available at the following locations:  \n* Birmingham Airport  \n* Bristol Airport  \n* Cardiff Airport  \n* East Midlands Airport  \n* Edinburgh Airport  \n* Eurostar Brussels-South Terminal (juxtaposed controls)  \n* Eurostar Paris Nord Terminal (juxtaposed controls)  \n* Gatwick Airport (both terminals)  \n* Glasgow Airport  \n* Heathrow Airport (all terminals)  \n* London City Airport  \n* Luton Airport  \n* Manchester Airport (all terminals)  \n* Newcastle Airport  \n* Stansted Airport  \n## Suspension  \nAt some airports, the UK Border Force temporarily suspends the operation of ePassport gates when certain flights that are deemed to be 'high risk' arrive. For example, at Glasgow Airport, the UK Border Force has on occasions disabled the operation of ePassport gates when flights arrive from Romania, as it regards those flights to be 'high risk' from a safeguarding perspective. By requiring all arriving passengers to use a staffed immigration counter, UK Border Force officers are better able to identify potential victims of trafficking and modern slavery.  \nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, ePassport gates were for a time suspended for all nationalities, including for all British nationals.\n\nQuestion: Which airport features ePassport gates that are located in the South Terminal?\nChoice list: \nA.

Formerly based at Elm Park, the club plays at the 24,161 capacity Madejski Stadium, named after chairman Sir John Madejski. After winning the 2005–06 Football League Championship with a record of 106 points, Reading F.C. spent two seasons in the Premier League before being relegated to The Championship. During their Premier League first season, they fractionally missed-out on UEFA Cup qualification.  \nReading Town Football Club, formed in 1966, played at Scours Lane and were playing in the Hellenic League Premier Division prior to folding in June 2016. Reading City Football Club (Formerly Highmoor Ibis) have since moved back to Scours Lane having formerly played there up to 2011 which was renamed Rivermoor Stadium in 2016 upon the clubs return and currently play in the Hellenic League Premier Division.\n\n## Rugby  \nReading was a centre for rugby union football in the area, with the Aviva Premiership team London Irish as tenants at the Madejski Stadium until they moved back to London into the Brentford Community Stadium at the start of the 2020-21 Premiership Season. Reading is home to three senior semi-professional rugby clubs; Reading Abbey R.F.C., Redingensians R.F.C. and Reading R.F.C.  \n## Palmer Park Stadium  \n<image>Palmer Park Stadium\nPalmer Park Stadium within Palmer Park has a velodrome and athletics track.

The annual Reading Town Regatta takes place near Thames Valley Park, with the Reading Amateur Regatta taking place in June, usually two weeks prior to Henley Royal Regatta.\n\n## Speedway  \nThe town was home to a motorcycle speedway team, Reading Racers. Speedway came to Reading in 1968 at Tilehurst Stadium, until the team moved to Smallmead Stadium in Whitley, which was demolished at the end of 2008. The team was inactive pending the building of a new stadium, which it was hoped to complete in 2012. The team reformed in 2016 joining the newly formed Southern Developmental League the following year.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Lotus T128 (Le Mans Prototype)  \nThe Lotus T128 is a Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) designed by former Sauber technical director James Key and built by Advanced Design and Engineering Systems Solutions (ADESS) and Kodewa. It was used by Kodewa in the 2013 FIA World Endurance Championship under the name Lotus. Stéphane Chosse, the founder of ADESS, first proposed building a Le Mans prototype car in March 2011. The vehicle's construction began in February 2013, eleven months after Kodewa acquired two chassis. The T128's aerodynamic study was carried out using a computer-aided software mesh tool from Altair Engineering, and aerodynamics was the main priority in its design, with Chosse taking a similar approach as when he was involved in Formula One. It uses a naturally aspirated V8 engine from the BMW S65, which is also used in the company's M3 model, and produces around kW.  \nThe programme was officially announced during the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans race weekend, and its scheduled first test in December was delayed by seven weeks to allow for the installation of additional parts. Both cars failed to finish the season-opening 2013 6 Hours of Silverstone but finished in the top six at Spa-Francorchamps. A legal dispute over unpaid invoices arose during the 24 Hours of Le Mans, resulting in the cars being temporarily seized by bailiffs until a Le Mans court ordered their return after Lotus proved that the invoices were fictitious. Both cars failed to finish the race and the subsequent round in São Paulo. Lotus took their only podium of the season at the 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas, but finished no higher than sixth in the final three races. The two T128s finished seventh and eighth in the FIA Endurance Trophy for LMP2 Teams. After the season, Lotus moved into LMP1 and replaced the T128s with a new car, the CLM P1/01.  \n## Development  \n### Concept  \nIn March 2011, Stéphane Chosse, founder of the German-based Advanced Design and Engineering Systems Solutions (ADESS), announced preliminary plans to build a Le Mans Prototype car. A year later, German racing team Kodewa ordered two chassis for the 2013 FIA World Endurance Championship. ADESS and Kodewa developed it in the Bavarian capital of Munich's high-technology park. The T128 was also designed to meet the 2014 Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) regulations, which significantly improved driver safety and visibility. The project was overseen by Kodewa co-founder Romulus Kolles, Lotus F1 Team manager Patrick Louis, Gravity Charouz Racing manager Antonin Charouz, and Petr Ptacek, owner of Czech car manufacturer Praga. Former Sauber technical director James Key assisted them. With Lotus as title sponsor, the Kodewa team adopted the Lotus name. Kodewa planned to sell the T128 to client teams for use in other championships.  \n### Design  \n<image>The T128's black and gold livery was designed by automotive futurist Daniel Simon.\nAltair Engineering's computer-aided design software was used for the car study. ADESS engineers used the HyperMesh tool to obtain numerical simulations using finite elements. Finally, the use of the Radioss software enabled the simulation of crash tests, which influenced the design of the monohull's front nose. The scale wind tunnel at the Mercedes-Benz Formula One team's Brackley headquarters was used to develop the design's aerodynamics. Choose stated that the car's aerodynamics were the main priority in its design, and he took a similar approach to his years in Formula One. The rollover protection structure is integrated into the carbon fibre reinforced polymer chassis. Automotive futurist Daniel Simon designed the car's black and gold livery. The suspension setup at the front and rear of the vehicle was a double wishbone pushrod actuated torsion bar with dampers housed inside the car's monocoque. It had bodywork elements that directed airflow into the chassis.  \nIts engine, a naturally aspirated V8 variant of the BMW S65 used in the company's M3 model, was angled at 90 degrees, and rebadged by Praga. For the best efficiency rate, engineers used the S65 production block, reducing its capacity to abbr=on. The engine produces abbr=on and a maximum speed of 9,500 revolutions per minute (rpm). When the driver reaches 7,000 rpm, the engine produces 405 NM of torque. Hewland Transmissions custom-designed and installed a six-speed sequential gearbox onto the car's engine. A single intake was mounted on the car's roof to allow airflow into it. The Brembo brake discs were made of carbon ceramic materials and also features power steering. The T128 monocoque began production in February 2013, and it was homologated a month later. After the car's launch, Igor Zamorano of Motorpasión wrote of his feeling that its front resembled the Audi R18.\n\n### Preparation and drivers  \n<image>Jan Charouz, Dominik Kraihamer and Thomas Holzer were selected to drive the No. 32 car by Lotus.\nDuring the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans weekend, Lotus publicly announced its T128 programme. The first picture of the car was made public on 1 August. Lotus planned to test the T128 in the first week of December 2012, but due to late part fitting, those plans were postponed to the third week of January 2013. That month, the team announced their intention to compete in the World Endurance Championship. Lotus also confirmed the return of Thomas Holzer and Kevin Weeda from the previous season. Less than a month later, the team re-signed James Rossiter and Vitantonio Liuzzi to drive one of the two T128s alongside Weeda. Lotus entered just one T128 for the pre-season test session at the Circuit Paul Ricard on March 28. Christophe Bouchut would share the No. 31 car with Liuzzi and Rossiter, and Dominik Kraihamer would share the No. 32 car with Weeda and 2009 Le Mans Series LMP1 champion Jan Charouz. During the various sessions, a ruptured oil tank limited the sole car's running for several hours before a replacement arrived and Rossiter drove some installation laps.\n\n## Racing history  \n### Season-opening European leg  \n<image>The No. 31 Lotus T128  being driven at the 6 Hours of Silverstone.\nLotus were expected to bring two T128s to the season-opening 6 Hours of Silverstone and changed the driver lineups of both cars. Weeda, Bouchut (in for Rossiter who was racing in the Japanese Super Formula Championship) and Liuzzi drove the No. 31 T128 and Holzer, Kraihamer and Charouz raced the No. 32 vehicle. Due to variable weather conditions, Kraihamer and Charouz qualified fifth on the grid in class, while Liuzzi and Bouchut qualified sixth. During the first hour, the No. 31 car was forced into the pit lane due to electrical issues, while Charouz and Nicolas Minassian's No. 49 Pecom Racing Nissan Oreca 03 entry collided.  \nLater, the No. 31 car's steering issues prevented it from finishing, and the No. 32 car's electrical problems prevented it from completing enough laps to be classified in the final results. Rossiter returned to Lotus for the season's second race, the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, and replaced Bouchut as one of the three drivers of the No. 32 car. Both cars started from the fourth row of the grid with Liuzzi and Rossiter's No. 31 T128 seventh and Holter and Kraihamer's sister No. 32 vehicle eighth. Due to alternator issues, both vehicles were slowed down in the race but were still able to finish in their respective class positions (albeit switched with the No. 32 in seventh and the No. 31 in eighth).\n<image>The No. 31 Lotus T128 at the 24 Hours of Le Mans showing the damage on its left-hand side and with the open left door.\nBouchut set the fastest time for the No. 31 car in the first qualifying session for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, placing him 15th in class, while Holzer secured 16th for the No. 32 car in the third (and final) qualifying session. Soon after, the No. 32 was relegated to the back of the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) grid for failing to have all three of their drivers set qualifying lap times within 110 per cent of the class leader's pole time. Weeda spun entering the second Mulsanne Chicane and beached the No. 31 car across the kerbs in the second hour due to the changing weather. The car pulled over at the side of the track after 17 laps and was declared retired four hours later with electrical problems. The No. 32 crew were impeded by the left door becoming loose twice and it later lost its rear body cover. Furthermore, the trio's lack of experience due to their young combined age and reoccurring engine overheating issues dropped the car down the order. In the 17th hour, a bell housing failure in the No. 32 car damaged its fitted auxiliaries, curtailing Lotus's race prematurely.\n\n#### Legal issues  \nLotus filed a lawsuit against Chosse, ADESS, and SCE Solutions on June 17 after learning that the team's owners, Romulus and Colin Kolles, were in debt. Choose filed a complaint in a French court, claiming that the owners of Kolles owed them \"a seven-figure amount\" in unpaid invoices. On June 18, Chosse responded, and at 17:00 local time, a bailiff seized the two Lotus T128s. Lotus presented fictitious invoices from ADESS, and on the afternoon of June 19, the Le Mans court decided in favour of Lotus. The court mandated that Lotus receive both vehicles back. 2018, the legal battle is ongoing,  \n### Podium in the Americas  \nFor the 6 Hours of São Paulo, Rossiter was absent because of a Super GT commitment in Japan and Liuzzi was committed to racing in the Superstars Series, leaving Weeda and Bouchut to operate the No. 31 car as a two-person entry. Kraihamer and Holzer were among the top five in their class, while the second Lotus of Weeda and Bouchut were two places further back on the grid due to slower traffic. When Kraihamer lost control of the rear of the No. 32 car and hit the left-hand side of Stéphane Sarrazin's faster No. 8 Toyota TS030 Hybrid, the No. 32 car's race ended early. As a result, both vehicles ploughed into the turn three outside tyre barrier. Both drivers were unhurt. Bouchut's No. 31 vehicle had gearbox problems from the start of the race and was forced into the pit lane. Bouchut was able to return to the track but the car was not classified in the final results.  \nLotus mechanics changed the No. 31 car's engine after practice for the inaugural 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas, the fourth since the start of the season, resulting in a three-minute stop-and-go penalty for the team. The No. 31 car set the sixth-fastest average LMP2 lap time in qualifying, and Charouz went into the rear of Sarrazin's No. 8 Toyota TS030 Hybrid as they approached the first corner, sending the latter car into a spin. Rossiter collided with Pierre Kaffer's No. 49 Pecom Racing Nissan Oreca 03 at the first turn of the race. Due to extensive damage to the suspension of the T128, Rossiter was forced to withdraw the car from the race. But Kraihamer, Charouz, and Holzer's No. 32 car finished third to earn the team's only podium result of the season.  \n### Season-ending races in Asia  \nAs the team concentrated on finding the ideal setup for the 6 Hours of Fuji, both Lotus T128s qualified for the race in dry and sunny conditions, starting in eighth and ninth places (the No. 31 car ahead of the No. 32 vehicle). Typhoon Wipha's passing brought heavy rain to the area, preventing any competitive action and limiting the overall race winner to only 16 laps behind the safety car. Hence, both Lotus cars finished the race eighth and tenth. Bouchut replaced Rossiter, who was unavailable due to a Super Formula commitment at the Suzuka Circuit, for the 6 Hours of Shanghai. The No. 31 car qualified seventh, while the No. 32 car started eighth. In the first hour, Holzer and Niclas Jönsson's No. 57 AF Corse Ferrari 458 Italia collided, damaging the No. 32 car's left-rear corner and forcing it into the garage. The other T128 retired due to engine failure while the No. 31 recovered to seventh in class.  \nWhile Rossiter was announced as returning to co-drive the No. 31 for the season-ending 6 Hours of Bahrain, he was unable to attend, and thus Lucas Auer, the Formula Three European Championship fourth-place finisher and nephew of former Formula One driver Gerhard Berger, filled his place for his debut sports car endurance race. On the LMP2 grid, the two Lotus T128s qualified seventh and eighth. In the first hour, Liuzzi collided with the No. 35 OAK Racing Nissan Morgan LMP2, sending the No. 31 car into the gravel trap. A few minutes later, Kraihamer made an error and collided with Richard Lietz's No. 92 Porsche 911 RSR left-rear corner. The Lotus stopped for 20 laps at turn ten before being declared a non-finisher due to heavy damage. Competing with the T128, the Lotus team accumulated 37 and 11 points for both cars, placing them seventh and eighth respectively in the FIA Endurance Trophy for LMP2 Teams. After the season, Lotus switched to the LMP1 class and replaced the T128s with the new CLM P1/01 car.  \n## Results summary  \n(key) Races in bold indicates pole position.

It was the first under the No Surrender chronology and the seventh event in the 2005 TNA PPV schedule. Nine professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match were featured on the card.  \nThe main event was a No Surrender Dog Collar match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Raven defended the title against Abyss. Raven won the match, thus retaining the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The TNA X Division Championship was defended by Christopher Daniels against Petey Williams. Daniels retained the championship in the encounter. On the undercard, A.J. Styles defeated Sean Waltman with Jerry Lynn as the Special Guest Referee. Monty Brown and The Outlaw defeated the 3Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings) in a Tag Team Street Fight also on the card.  \nNo Surrender is marked by the debut of Rhino in TNA. Jason Clevett of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show an 8 out of 10, equal with the 2006 event's ranking of 8 out of 10 also by Clevett.  \nIn October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand.  \n## Production  \n### Background  \nTNA announced in late-April 2005 that they were planning to host a PPV titled No Surrender on July 17 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. Prior to No Surrender, TNA's television contract with Fox Sports Net ended. This left TNA without a broadcaster for several weeks. As a result, TNA began airing weekly episodes of their television program TNA Impact! on their official website in order to build storylines and promote the No Surrender PPV event. In an article by TNA columnist Bill Banks, it was reported that some \"new talent\" could debut at No Surrender.  \nTNA released a poster promoting the event featuring A.J. Styles, Chris Harris, Christopher Daniels, and Jeff Jarrett at some point beforehand.  \n### Storylines  \nNo Surrender featured nine professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match that involved wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines portraying villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters; these scripted events built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.  \n<image>alt=An adult white male with long hair posing for a picture.\nThe main event at No Surrender was a No Surrender Dog Collar match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the challenger Abyss. On the June 24 episode of Impact!, James Mitchell returned to the promotion in a backstage segment with Abyss. Mitchell propositioned Abyss on the idea of an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, which Abyss agreed to, creating a partnership between the two. With Mitchell as Abyss' new manager, Abyss attacked Raven later during the show, setting up a match between the two at the PPV. Raven challenged Abyss to a Dog Collar match with \"No Surrender\" rules in which the only way to win was by pinfall at No Surrender on the July 1 episode of Impact!, which was accepted. During the July 15 episode of Impact!, Cassidy Reilly pledged his allegiance to Raven for past experiences in which Raven had saved him, going on to state he would be there to help Raven anytime he needed it.  \nThe TNA X Division Championship was defended in another high profiled match on the card. Then-champion Christopher Daniels was pitted against Petey Williams in the contest. On the July 1 episode of Impact!, Terry Taylor held an interview with Daniels. During this time, Daniels announced he had defeated the best Mexican Luchador in Shocker and the best American wrestlers in Chris Sabin and Michael Shane to retain the X Division Championship. At this time, Canadian wrestler Petey Williams entered and challenged Daniels to a title defense at No Surrender, which Daniels accepted.  \nA.J. Styles challenged Sean Waltman with Jerry Lynn as the Special Guest Referee in another encounter promoted for No Surrender. At TNA's previous PPV event Slammiversary on June 19, then-champion Styles defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a King of the Mountain match against Abyss, Monty Brown, Raven, and Waltman. Waltman and Styles created an alliance during the match, which ended when Waltman turned on Styles, costing him the championship as Raven went on to win the match. Styles and Waltman had a confrontation on the July 1 episode of Impact!, which was stopped by Lynn. Styles asked for a match against Waltman from NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko on the July 8 episode of Impact!. Zbyszko granted Styles his request only after making Lynn the Special Guest Referee.  \nA Tag Team Street Fight pitting the 3 Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings) against the team of Monty Brown and The Outlaw was promoted for the undercard. On the June 24 episode of Impact!, Brown and The Outlaw attacked Konnan and Killings during an interview with TNA commentator Mike Tenay. Brown and The Outlaw proceeded to parody Konnan, Killings, and 3Live Kru member B.G. James leading up to No Surrender. Following a fight between Konnan, Killings, Brown, and The Outlaw on the July 15 episode of Impact!, Tenay announced the two teams were scheduled for a Street Fight at No Surrender.\n\n## Event  \n### Pre-Show  \nTNA held a thirty-minute pre-show prior to the event, during which Shocker was pitted against Jerrelle Clark. Shocker won the bout at 4 minutes and 16 seconds with a roll-up pin.  \n### Miscellaneous  \nNo Surrender featured employees other than the wrestlers involved in the matches. Mike Tenay and Don West were the commentators for the telecast. Jeremy Borash, for main event only, and David Penzer were ring announcers for the event. Andrew Thomas, Rudy Charles, and Mark \"Slick\" Johnson participated as referees for the encounters. Shane Douglas handled the interview duties for the event. Besides employees who appeared in a wrestling role, Jeff Jarrett, Jimmy Hart, Traci, James Mitchell, and Rhino all appeared on camera, either in backstage or in ringside segments.  \n### Preliminary matches  \n<image>alt=An adult Indian male wearing a black and white striped shirt.\nThe event opened with a tag team match between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) and the team of Alex Shelley and Michael Shane, who were accompanied by Traci. The duration of the bout was 11 minutes and 47 seconds. At one point, Storm lifted up Shane, so Harris could dive off the top rope and bash him in the chest with his forearm. Later, Storm was thrown out of the ring but held on to the top rope. He attempted to pull himself back in, however, Shelley dropkicked him from inside the ring, knocking him to the outside. AMW won the match after Storm pinned Shelley following a kick to the chin.  \nTNA held a Four Way match for the last spot in the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament between Elix Skipper, Mikey Batts, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. The competition lasted 8 minutes and 22 seconds. Elix Skipper performed his signature maneuver the Sudden Death on Batts near the end. He attempted a cover but was stopped by Shark Boy. Shark Boy then went for a cover, who was stopped by Dutt. Dutt then performed his signature aerial maneuver the Hindu Press, landing on Batts to gain the victory and enter the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament.  \nDavid Young and Simon Diamond fought Apolo and Sonny Siaki in the third encounter. It lasted 5 minutes and 32 seconds. Close to the end, Davidlifted up and slammed Siaki back-first into the mat with a Spinebuster. The referee refused to count the pin, deeming that David was not the eligible man. This allowed Apolo to lift up and slam David face-first into the mat to win the match.  \nIn the fourth match, Samoa Joe was pitted against Chris Sabin. Joe performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then placed Sabin in his signature submission hold the Coquina Clutch. Instead of submitting, Sabin instead passed out in storyline, with the referee lifting and raising his arm three times before giving the victory to Joe at 14 minutes and 2 seconds.  \nA Six Man Tag Team match between Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) and the team of Lance Hoyt and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens), who were accompanied by Jimmy Hart, was next. The match duration was 14 minutes and 44 seconds. Douglas scored a near-fall after Hoyt slammed Eric back-first to the mat. The Naturals set up for their Natural Disaster tag team maneuver on Eric, however, Roode entered and bashed Douglas and Stevens with a megaphone. Eric then covered Douglas for the win.\n\n### Main event matches  \n<image>alt=An adult white male wearing black standing in a wrestling ring.\nThe sixth contest was a Tag Team Street Fight pitting the team of Monty Brown and The Outlaw against the 3Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings). A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification rules, which is won either by a pinfall or submission. The Outlaw requested to be called by a new name before the contest, Kip James. The Outlaw was busted open during the bout. Multiple referees had to be replaced for the match, due to reoccurring attacks on them by The Outlaw. Brown won the encounter after performing his signature Pounce maneuver on Killings, knocking him across the ring onto the mat, at 5 minutes and 20 seconds. After the contest, B.G. James entered the ring where The Outlaw offered James a chair to hit Konnan with, which James declined.  \nJerry Lynn was Special Guest Referee for the next encounter between A.J. Styles and Sean Waltman. Styles bleed from the nose during the match. Styles gained a near-fall on Waltman after performing his signature Styles Clash maneuver and slamming Waltman face-first into the mat. Waltman also gained a near-fall following his signature X-Factor maneuver and forcing Styles face-first into the mat. Later, Styles jumped from the ring apron over the top rope and Waltman in a sunset flip. Waltman held onto the ropes, trying to prevent a pin attempt, until Lynn kicked his hands off the top rope. Styles then rolled through and lifted Waltman up to perform the Styles Clash at 14 minutes and 37 seconds to win the competition.  \nThe TNA X Division Championship was defended by Christopher Daniels against Petey Williams, who was accompanied by A-1. The duration was 16 minutes and 24 seconds. During the match, Williams put Daniels in his Sharpshooter submission hold, which Williams was forced to release when Daniels grabbed the bottom rope. A-1 tossed Williams a chain to bash Daniels with. However, Daniels had his own chain which he used to punch Williams with and followed by performing his signature Best Moonsault Ever maneuver, splashing onto Williams, to retain the championship.  \nThe main event was a No Surrender Dog Collar match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the challenger Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell. The encounter lasted 19 minutes and 17 seconds. In a Dog Collar match, both competitors are tied together at the neck by a long steel chain that is attached to a dog collar. The match is fought under no disqualification rules; in this case the only way to win was by pinfall. Abyss crashed through a table at ringside after Raven pushed him off the stage. Abyss removed the collar during the match and retrieved a bag of thumbtacks. He then poured them over the mat and ripped Raven's shirt off, before attempting to slam him into them. Cassidy Reilly interfered in the contest stopping Abyss. Later, Cassidy was shoved off the ring apron by Abyss and he crashed through a table. Raven followed by slamming Abyss back-first into the tacks with a powerbomb and covered for a near-fall. Abyss also gained a near-fall on Raven after slamming him into the mat back-first with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver. Raven finally won the contest following forcing Abyss head-first into thumbtacks with his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver to retain the championship. Following the bout, a segment took place between Raven and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when Rhino made his TNA debut and tackled Raven with his signature Gore maneuver.\n\n## Reception  \nA total of 775 people attended No Surrender. Canadian Online Explorer writer Jason Clevett rated the entire event an 8 out of 10, which was equal with the 8 of 10 given to the 2006 No Surrender by Clevett. No Surrender's rating was higher than TNA's previous event Slammiversary, which was given a 7 out of 10 by Clevett. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's The Great American Bash PPV event held on July 24, No Surrender was rated higher, as Bob Kapur gave The Great American Bash a 5 out of 10. Clevett felt that No Surrender proved that \"when everything clicks they TNA can put on a fantastic show that gives fans their money's worth.\" A.J. Styles versus Sean Waltman, Samoa Joe versus Chris Sabin, and the X Division Championship match were signaled out by Clevett as three \"fantastic matches on a solid undercard.\" Clevett gave his highest match rating of 9 out of 10 in his review to the Joe versus Sabin bout. He gave his lowest rating of 3 out of 10 to the Tag Team Street Fight. The main event, Styles versus Waltman, and the X Division Championship matches were all given an 8 out of 10 by Clevett. Regarding the Dog Collar match, Clevett thought it was a \"bloody and violent encounter, as one would expect with those two in the ring.\" When commenting on the Styles versus Waltman encounter, Clevett thought it \"was undoubtable Waltman's best match in years\".  \nWade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch rated the main event, Styles versus Waltman, and Joe versus Sabin all 3 and a half stars out of 5. However, the X Division Championship match received a 3 and a three-fourths stars out of 5, his highest rating of the review. He gave the lowest ranking to the Tag Team Street Fight, at a half of a star. Keller commented on the main event as being \"what you'd expect, and that's not a bad thing\". Keller thought the Styles versus Waltman bout was a \"very good match, the best from Waltman in years\". James Caldwell, also of the Pro Wrestling Torch, published a review of the show. In his review he stated that the main event was a \"good car wreck match\", which \"told a good story based on the storyline entering the match\". Regarding the X Division Championship bout, Caldwell thought that \"both men worked a solid match\". \"A good wrestling match that showed Waltman still has it.\", said Caldwell as he commented on the Styles versus Waltman encounter. Caldwell believed that Joe versus Sabin was a \"damn good match\". TNA released a DVD counting down the top 50 moments in their history in 2007, with Rhino's debut listed at number 36.  \n## Aftermath  \n<image>alt=An adult Samoan male posing while wearing orange and black wrestling trunks.\nFollowing No Surrender, Raven went on to feud with Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. Jarrett and Rhino attacked Raven on the July 22 episode of Impact!, claiming he had no allies to help him. On the July 29 episode of Impact!, Jarrett and Rhino attacked Cassidy Riley as well, until Raven announced he had chosen a partner to team with him in a Tag Team match to face Jarrett and Rhino at TNA's next PPV event Sacrifice on August 14. Sabu then appeared attacking Jarrett and Rhino with Raven. At Sacrifice, NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko added a stipulation to the encounter, in which if Jarrett pinned Raven he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, however, if Raven pinned Jarrett then he would not garner one for an entire year. The team of Jarrett and Rhino won the contest at the event, with Rhino gaining the pinfall victory.  \nAbyss began a feud with Lance Hoyt after No Surrender, when Abyss attacked Hoyt on the July 22 episode of Impact!. In return Hoyt attacked Abyss on the August 5 episode of Impact!, setting up a match between the two at Sacrifice. Abyss won the match at the event.  \nTNA held the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament in the weeks following No Surrender leading up to Sacrifice. It was a single-elimination tournament which involved eight men, A.J. Styles, Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Michael Shane, Petey Williams, Samoa Joe, Shocker, and Sonjay Dutt. The winner of the tournament would become number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship held by Christopher Daniels. Daniels provided commentary to each of the encounters on the July 22, July 29, August 5, and August 10 episodes of Impact!, as well as the Finals at Sacrifice. Daniels unofficially named the tournament the Christopher Daniels Invitational. The tournament came down to Joe and Styles in the Finals at Sacrifice, which Joe won after interference from Daniels.  \nSean Waltman and Jerry Lynn sparked a rivalry after No Surrender due to Lynn's interference in Waltman's bout against Styles, with the two facing at Sacrifice. The storyline revolving around this match began on the July 22 episode of Impact!, where Waltman accused Lynn of trying to steal his spotlight in a backstage segment, while Lynn took credit for Waltman's success in the industry for helping Waltman get his start. Lynn defeated Waltman at the event.  \nThe 3Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings) and the team of Monty Brown and The Outlaw fought at Sacrifice, this time with B.G. James as Special Guest Referee. Due to The Outlaw attacking several referees during the Street Fight at No Surrender, TNA officials refused to referee a rematch between the two teams at Sacrifice. As such, this forced Zbyszko to name B.G. as the Special Guest Referee on the July 29 episode of Impact!. The 3Live Kru were the victors at Sacrifice.\n\n## Results\n\nQuestion: Which wrestler was involved in a No Surrender Dog Collar match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the No Surrender event and successfully retained the title?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Government of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India  \nGovernment of National Capital Territory of Delhi versus Union of India and Another Civil Appeal Number 2357 of 2017 is a civil appeal heard before the Supreme Court of India by a five-judge constitution bench of the court. The case was filed as an appeal to an August2016 verdict of the Delhi High Court that ruled that the lieutenant governor of Delhi exercised \"complete control of all matters regarding National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi\", and was heard by the Supreme Court in November and December2017.  \nThe supreme court pronounced its judgment on 4 July2018; it said the lieutenant governor of Delhi had no independent decision-making powers and was bound to follow the \"aid and advice\" of the Delhi chief-minister-headed council of ministers of the Government of Delhi on all matters except those pertaining to police, public order and land. The verdict was positively received almost unanimously by politicians from multiple parties.  \n## Background  \nThe Government of India Act 1919 and the Government of India Act 1935 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom during the British rule in India classified Delhi as a chief commissioner's province, which meant Delhi was directly ruled by the governor-general through his or her representative, the chief commissioner. The chief commissioner of Delhi used to be an appointed civil servant and reported directly to the governor-general.  \nAfter India's independence and with the passing of the Government of Part C States Act, 1951, Delhi was classified as a Part C state, with an appointed chief commissioner and an elected chief minister-led council of ministers, which had powers over \"public utilities, sanitation, water supply et al.\", that was accountable and responsible to the Delhi Legislative Assembly. but not over 'police', 'public order', 'land' et al.  \nAfter the passing of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 and the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 on the recommendations of the Fazal Ali-headed States Reorganisation Commission, however, states were reorganised; tier-classification of states was abandoned and top-level subdivisions of India were categorised as either states or union territories (UT),. Delhi was classified a UT; its council of ministers and legislative assembly were dissolved. To give Delhi some elected leadership, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi Act, 1957 was passed by the parliament, establishing the now-trifurcated Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Delhi, however, did not come under the Government of Union Territories Act, 1961, which allowed for legislative assemblies and councils of ministers in some large union territories. There were widespread demands for Delhi to get statehood and more elected representatives in its general governance.  \nAs a compromise, the Delhi Metropolitan Council was formed in 1966 with the passing of the Delhi Administration Act, 1966 by the Parliament of India; the council had fifty-sixdirectly-elected members (called councillors) and fivemembers nominated by the newly-created position of lieutenant governor (LG). The council had only advisory powers with regards to legislative proposals, budget proposals and other matters referred to it by the lieutenant governor. The lieutenant governor succeeded the chief commissioner as the administrator of Delhi. The Delhi Metropolitan Council's chairman and deputy chairman acted as speaker and deputy speaker for the council, which elected a chief executive councillor and three executive councillors, much like a state chief minister and council of ministers elected by—and responsible to—vidhan sabhas.  \nAfter widespread demands for a legislative assembly, Delhi was granted further autonomy with the passing of the Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 by the parliament, which established the Delhi Legislative Assembly, allowing for the reintroduction of the chief minister and the council of ministers, replacing the chief executive councillor and executive councillors, respectively.  \n## Premise  \n<image>Najeeb Jung, the lieutenant governor of Delhi from July 2013 to December 2016\nIn April2015, the Delhi lieutenant governor (LG) Najeeb Jung said it was not mandatory for him to send files regarding police, public order and land—his reserved subjects—to the chief minister's office. Jung was backed by the Ministry of Home Affairs in May2015 which through a government notification said the LG had the final decision on matters related to police, public order, land and services, adding that the Delhi Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) could not investigate central government employees.  \nIn June2015, while presenting the Delhi budget for approval to the Delhi Legislative Assembly, the deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia—acting as the finance minister—announced the government's intention to raise circle rates on agricultural land throughout the National Capital Territory of Delhi. In August2015, Lieutenant Governor Jung opposed the government's move on circle rates and stayed it. In response, the Delhi government reasserted its intention to raise the circle rate, saying the LG had no say on the matter and was bound to follow the government's aid and advice.  \nIn August2015, the Delhi government ordered the creation of a commission of inquiry headed by retired Delhi High Court judge, S. N. Aggarwal to investigate the alleged CNG fitness scam that occurred during the chief ministership of Indian National Congress member Sheila Dikshit. The move was opposed by Jung, who referred the matter to the Ministry of Home Affairs, asking whether it was legal for the government to form a commission of inquiry without his approval. The home ministry later ruled that the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi was \"not the competent authority to set up\" an inquiry commission, thus holding that the Delhi government order was \"legally invalid and void ab initio\".  \nIn December2015, the Delhi government formed a one-member commission of inquiry composed of former solicitor general, Gopal Subramanium to investigate an alleged scam in the Delhi & District Cricket Association. Lieutenant Governor Jung asked for the Government of India's opinion on the legality of the inquiry commission. Chief Minister Kejriwal maintained that the commission of inquiry was legal and asked the Government of India to move the Delhi High Court if it had any issue with the commission's formation. In January2016, the Ministry of Home Affairs informed Jung that the commission was not valid because the Delhi government did not have the power to form an inquiry commission because Delhi was not a state.  \nIn August2016, at the Delhi government's behest, a division bench of the High Court of Delhi composed of Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath ruled that the LG had \"complete control of all matters regarding National Capital Territory of Delhi\". The court also pronounced that all commissions of inquiry set up by the Government of Delhi were illegal, it also ruled that directions issued by the government to the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission and the directors nominated by it to the boards of private electricity companies were illegal. Further, the court upheld the May2015 Ministry of Home Affairs notification which ruled that the Delhi ACB could not investigate central government employees. The court, however, said the LG was bound by the aid and advice of the Delhi council of ministers on matters related to the appointments of special public prosecutors. Not satisfied with the high court's decision, the Delhi government ministers Kejriwal, Sisodia and Satyendra Jain decided to move the supreme court.\n\n### Civil servants  \nIn May2015, after the Delhi chief secretary and Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer K. K. Sharma went on leave for ten days, Lieutenant Governor Jung ordered Shakuntala Gamlin, IAS officer and principal secretary in charge of Delhi government's departments of power and industries, to officiate as the chief secretary in Sharma's absence. This was opposed by Kejriwal, who accused Gamlin of lobbying for power companies. Gamlin wrote to LG Jung that industries minister Satyendra Jain was putting pressure on her in a matter related to industrial plots.  \nAnindo Majumdar, the Delhi government's principal secretary for its services department and IAS officer, was locked out of his office on the direction of the chief minister's office; the order added that Majumdar had been replaced by Kejriwal's principal secretary and IAS officer, Rajendra Kumar, and that Majumdar had been divested of all of his charges. The order, however, was declared null and void by Lieutenant Governor Jung, saying his approval for transferring Majumdar was not taken. Majumdar subsequently said he opposed the \"politicisation\" of senior bureaucratic appointments and refused to follow any \"unconstitutional\" orders from Kejriwal.  \nIn June2015, seven officers of the Bihar Police joined Delhi ACB on deputation; in opposition to the move, Lieutenant Governor Jung said the ACB was solely under his jurisdiction, resulting in the officers not being assigned any tasks for months. This was followed by Jung naming Indian Police Service (IPS) officer M. K. Meena, an inspector general-ranked Delhi Police joint commissioner heading its New Delhi range, as the ACB's head. This was in contravention to Kejriwal's demands; Kejriwal had appointed deputy inspector general-ranked IPS officer S. S. Yadav as the ACB chief. In June2015, the Delhi High Court refused to set aside Meena's appointment but asked him to act in \"accordance with law\". Consequently, the Delhi government reduced Meena's mandate, asking him to look after training and cases undergoing trial. Yadav was asked to handle—among other things—investigations and functioning of the agency.  \nOn 9 June2015, Jung vetoed Kejriwal's transfer of IAS officer Dharam Pal from the Delhi government's principal secretary in charge of its home and land and buildings departments, citing the April2015 home ministry notification that transferred the power over services to the LG.  \nIn August2016, following the Rajender Prashad v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi decision of the Delhi High Court, the Delhi government-appointed Indian Revenue Service officer Tarun Seem, and a former engineer-in-chief of the PWD Sarvagaya Srivastava—non-IAS secretaries in charge of health and PWD respectively—were replaced by Jung with IAS officers Chandraker Bharti and Ashwani Kumar as principal secretaries for health and PWD, respectively. The move was opposed by Kejriwal, who said that deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, had \"begged\" Jung to not transfer health and PWD secretaries before March2017. Kejriwal added that files for the transfer of bureaucrats were not shown to him or any other minister of the government. In response, Jung's office said Seem and Srivastava's postings were illegal because they were in contravention with the Government of India's cadre rules, adding that even posting Seem to a position in the Delhi government was illegal because the LG's approval to post him was not taken.  \nIn October2016, Jung gave IAS officer Alka Diwan the additional charge of being the Delhi Commission for Women's (DCW) member-secretary. Diwan proceeded to stop salary payments to contractual employees of the DCW and asked the commission's chairperson Swati Maliwal to regularise contractual employees by sending a proposal to the Delhi government's finance department. This led to Kejriwal asking Jung to remove her. Jung then replaced Diwan with another IAS officer Dilraj Kaur, conflicting with the wishes of Kejriwal, who had nominated the commission's legal adviser P. P. Dhal to act as the DCW's officiating member-secretary. This caused Kejriwal to compare Jung with Adolf Hitler.  \nIn February2018, Delhi's chief secretary and IAS officer Anshu Prakash was allegedly assaulted by some members of the Delhi Legislative Assembly (MLA) from the AAP. In response, the AAP released a statement saying Prakash said he was answerable to the LG and not MLAs or the CM; the statement also said Prakash had \"used bad language against some MLAs and had left without answering any questions\".  \n## Proceedings  \n<image>Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra was a member of the five-judge constitution bench that presided over Government of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India & Another\n\n<image>Building of the Supreme Court of India\nIn 2017, the supreme court heard arguments for fifteen days, beginning on 2 November2017 and finishing on 5 December2017. On 6 December2017, the court reserved its verdict on the matter.  \nThe Government of India (GoI) was represented by additional solicitor general Maninder Singh and former additional solicitor general and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra. The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) was represented by Indian National Congress member, former union minister and senior advocate P. Chidambaram, former solicitor general and senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, senior advocate Satya Mitra, former additional solicitor general and senior advocate Indira Jaising, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan and senior advocate Shekhar Naphade.  \nFor GNCTD, Chidambaram argued that Delhi's lieutenant governor was not like a viceroy but just the president's representative and that his or her powers were dependent on the president's pleasure. Chidambaram also argued that per the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, the LG was \"required to act on the aid and advice\" of the council of ministers of the Delhi government. Subramanium argued that the Delhi government was not debating the parliament's supremacy but said the legislative assembly also had \"elbow room\" in Delhi's governance, adding that the LG was misusing the powers assigned to his or her office to refer differences of opinion to the president. He also said the LG's extraordinary discretion was to be used in exceptional circumstances and not in day-to-day governance of Delhi and that the chief secretary and other officers did not exercise volition on the government's welfare schemes and proposals but simply used them to mechanically defer matters for the lieutenant governor's disposition.  \nFor the GoI, Singh argued that the Delhi government's role was limited to that of municipal governance, backing his argument up by saying the Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Civil Service and the Delhi Fire Service came under the GoI's jurisdiction rather than that of the Delhi government's. Singh also said that because Delhi did not have its own public service commission, it was not a state. Singh also argued that the GNCTD's executive powers were not binding on the lieutenant governor. Singh also said that because the Article239AA of the Constitution of India came under the section for union territories, Delhi was a union territory.  \nWhile hearing the case, the supreme court said Delhi's lieutenant governor had more powers than state governors, who were supposed to generally follow the aid and advice of the state chief minister-led council of ministers.\n\n## Judgment  \nThe supreme court ruled that according to the Article239AA of the Indian constitution, although the government had to keep him or her informed of its decisions, Delhi's lieutenant governor had no independent decision-making powers and had to follow the aid and advice of the chief-minister-led council of ministers of the Government of Delhi on matters the Delhi Legislative Assembly could legislate on, viz., all items on the State List (items on which only state legislatures can legislate) and the Concurrent List (items on which both the Parliament of India and the state legislatures can legislate) barring police, public order and land. The court added that on matters referred to him/her, the LG was bound to follow the orders of the president.  \nAlthough the court ruled that the lieutenant governor still had the right to seek the president's opinion in case of a disagreement between him/her and the government, the president—who is bound by the aid and advice of the prime minister-headed Union Council of Ministers—would be the final authority in case of a conflict, with his or her opinion being binding on both the LG and the Delhi government, it cautioned the LG to use this power only in exceptional circumstances and not in a \"routine or mechanical manner\". The court, however, did not define what \"trivial\" differences in opinion meant.  \nThe court also ruled that \"there is no room for absolutism and there is no room for anarchism also\" in the governance of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.  \nAt the same time, the supreme court—citing the report of the Balkrishnan Committeeof1987—ruled that although having a special status, Delhi was not a state; hence, unlike state governors, Delhi's lieutenant governor was not a mere constitutional figurehead but also bore the title of administrator.  \n## Reactions  \n<image>Delhi's chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, called the judgment a \"big victory\" for the people of Delhi and democracy\n\n<image>Naxalite type people\".\nThree-time Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, a member of  the Indian National Congress (INC), the largest constituent party of the United Progressive Alliance, said, \"if the Delhi government and the lieutenant governor (LG) don't work together then Delhi will face problems\". An INC spokesperson and a senior advocate, Abhishek Singhvi said the supreme court ruling was good \"in principle\", adding that there was no reason for the lieutenant governor to exercise discretion beyond his or her three reserved powers.  \nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary and politburo member Sitaram Yechury said there was no reason for governors and lieutenant governors to \"usurp the rights of elected\" governments, and that powerful governors and lieutenant governors appointed by the centre were in contravention with the constitution's federal structure. Former attorney general and a supreme court advocate Soli Sorabjee said the supreme court judgment was \"good\" and that the lieutenant governor and the Delhi government had to \"work harmoniously\", adding that regular confrontation between the two was \"not good for democracy\".\n\n\nQuestion: Which individual was involved in setting up a commission of inquiry to investigate an alleged scam in the Delhi & District Cricket Association?\nChoice list: \nA.

The tournament was held from 12 to 28 May 2023, organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).  \nAs in the 2022 edition, the tournament saw several upsets: Kazakhstan's win over Norway, Hungary's win over France, Latvia's first-ever victory over Czechia, Norway’s second-ever win over Canada, as well as Kazakhstan's first-ever victory over Slovakia. The playoffs also saw major upsets, as Latvia reached the semi-finals for the first time after defeating favourite Sweden 3–1 in the quarter-finals, Germany upset Switzerland 3–1 and the reigning Olympic and World Champion Finland lost to Canada 4–1. Czechia finished in 8th place after losing to the United States (USA) 3–0 in the quarter-finals, which is that nation's worst placement to date in the history of the World Championship. Germany reached the final for the first time since 1930 after upsetting the top-seeded USA 4–3 in overtime.  \nCanada won its 28th title by beating Germany 5–2 in the final. The silver was Germany's first medal since 1953. Latvia claimed its first ever IIHF medal after defeating the USA 4–3 in overtime and finishing third.  \n## Host nation bid  \nThe event was originally planned to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but, in February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) called for Russia and Belarus to be stripped of hosting rights to all international sporting events due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 26 April 2022, Russia lost their rights to host the World Championship.  \nAfter being promoted to the top division, Slovenia and Hungary bid to co-host the event in Ljubljana and Budapest. The bid was withdrawn due to Hungarian Ice Hockey Federation informing the IIHF that it did not receive the governmental guarantees to host. Finland and Latvia submitted a joint bid, with Nokia Arena in Tampere and Arena Riga in Riga as potential host venues. On 27 May 2022, the IIHF confirmed that Finland and Latvia would host the tournament, with Finland having also hosted the 2022 IIHF World Championship in Tampere (Nokia Arena) and Helsinki (Helsinki Ice Hall).  \n## Venues  \n## Participants  \nQualified as hosts  \n* FIN  \n* LAT  \nAutomatic qualifier after a top 14 placement at the 2022 IIHF World Championship:  \n* AUT  \n* CAN  \n* name=Czechia  \n* DEN  \n* FRASpiky 2.0, the official mascot of the championship in Riga  \n* GER  \n* KAZ  \n* NOR  \n* SVK  \n* SWE  \n* SUI  \n* USA  \nQualified through winning promotion at the 2022 IIHF World Championship Division I:  \n* HUN  \n* SLO  \n## Seeding  \nThe seedings in the preliminary round are based on the 2022 IIHF World Ranking, as of the end of the 2022 IIHF World Championship, using the serpentine system while allowing the organizer, \"to allocate a maximum of two teams to separate groups.\"  \nGroup A (Tampere)  \n* FIN (1)  \n* USA (4)  \n* SWE (5)  \n* GER (9)  \n* DEN (10)  \n* FRA (13)  \n* AUT (15)  \n* HUN (20)  \nGroup B (Riga)  \n* CAN (2)  \n* name=Czechia (6)  \n* SUI (7)  \n* SVK (8)  \n* LAT (11)  \n* NOR (12)  \n* KAZ (16)  \n* SLO (19)  \n## Rosters  \nEach team's roster consists of at least 15 skaters (forwards, and defencemen) and 2 goaltenders, and at most 22 skaters and 3 goaltenders.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Municipality (Austria)  \nIn the Republic of Austria, the municipality ( Gemeinde, sometimes also Ortsgemeinde) is the administrative division encompassing a single village, town, or city.  \nThe municipality has corporate status and local self-government on the basis of parliamentary-style representative democracy: a municipal council (Gemeinderat) elected through a form of party-list system enacts municipal laws, a municipal executive board (Gemeindevorstand) and a mayor (Bürgermeister, fem. Bürgermeisterin) appointed by the council are in charge of municipal administration. Austria is currently (January 1, 2020) partitioned into 2,095 municipalities, ranging in population from about fifty (the village of Gramais in Tyrol) to almost two million (the city of Vienna). There is no unincorporated territory in Austria.  \n## Basics  \nThe existence of municipalities and their role as carriers of the right to self-administration are guaranteed by the Austrian constitution (B-VG Art. 116 (1)).  \nThe constitution means for municipalities to be autonomous (eigenverantwortlich) in any matter that a village, town, or city can presumed to be both interested in handling and best capable of handling. Municipal authorities are required to comply with national and provincial legislation and can be held accountable by courts for failure to abide by the rule of law, but they are not politically answerable to national or provincial administrators and do not take orders from them. (B-VG 118)<image>leftAll real estate in Austria falls within a municipality's borders, meaning that there are no unincorporated areas and no way for either the government or any resident to sidestep the requirement that each permanent resident be part of a municipal community. (B-VG 116 (2)).\nAll municipalities are corporations and have the right to own property, run businesses, levy municipal taxes, and generally manage their own financial affairs. (B-VG 116 (3)).  \nMunicipalities have a right to form municipal associations, subject to supervision by the provincial administration (B-VG 116a) and enter into treaties with other municipalities (B-VG 116b).  \nMunicipalities are miniature parliamentary democracies with a legislature elected by the people and an executive branch installed and supervised by the legislature:  \n* The municipal council (Gemeinderat) serves as the communal legislature. Its members are chosen in free, secret, universal elections. Any registered permanent resident of the municipality in question who is eligible to vote in (or stand for) provincial elections (in the province the municipality is in) is also eligible to vote in (or stand for) the local municipal elections. By default, this restricts suffrage to Austrian citizens, but provinces may choose to extend the right to vote and run in municipal elections to citizens of other European Union members states. The constitution stipulates party-list proportional representation as the default voting system but allows direct votes for individual candidates in case there are no organized political parties choosing to run (B-VG 117 (2)). The council is a deliberative assembly reaching decisions collectively. (B-VG 117 (3)). Its sessions are public (B-VG 117 (4)).  \n* The municipal executive board (Gemeindevorstand)) supervises the community's administrative apparatus (B-VG 117 (7)). The number of seats each political party holds on the board is proportional to the number of seats it holds in the council (B-VG 117 (5)).  \n* The mayor (Bürgermeister, fem. Bürgermeisterin) is the community's head of government. By default, the mayor is elected by the council. Provinces may stipulate that the mayor be elected by the constituency instead. (B-VG 117 (6))  \n* Provincial legislation may provide for municipal referendum and other forms of direct democracy, within limits. (B-VG 117 (8))  \nMunicipal governments do not have judicial branches.\n\n## Types of municipalities  \n<image>Town hall of Bildstein, Vorarlberg, population ca. 700\n\n<image>Town hall of Pöllau, Styria, population ca. 2000\n\n<image>City hall of Hall in Tirol, Tyrol, population ca. 12,700. Hall was one of Austria's largest cities in the late Middle Ages and is still a regional economic and cultural hub today.\n\n<image>(B-VG 117 (1))\nInformally, municipalities that are neither cities nor market towns are sometimes called Landgemeinden, lit. \"rural municipalities\".\n\n## Responsibilities  \nThe constitution distinguishes between a municipality's sphere of inherent responsibilities (eigener Wirkungsbereich) and the sphere of responsibilities delegated to the municipalities by the higher levels of government (übertragener Wirkungsbereich). The constitution defines a minimum extent of the inherent sphere that national and provincial law may add to but not detract from: nowrap|(B-VG 118 (2))  \n* Levying municipal taxes (Gemeindeabgaben) and otherwise managing their own finances and their own property.  \n* Appointing municipal officials.  \n* Hiring and supervising municipal employees.  \n* Local security police (Sicherheitspolizei) and event control (Veranstaltungspolizei).  \n* Traffic space management including but not limited to road maintenance and traffic police.  \n* Crop protection (Flurschutz).  \n* Sanitary police matters, rescue services, interment services.  \n* Public decency (Sittlichkeitspolizei).  \n* Development planning, fire prevention, and general building code enforcement.  \n* Mediation services for out-of-court dispute resolution.  \nAdditional legislation vests municipalities with a large number of additional responsibilities. Municipalities are in charge of public water supply, sewage disposal, garbage disposal, public lighting, and cemetery construction and maintenance, among other things. They run schools and kindergartens, assisted living facilities, sports and cultural facilities, and fire departments. The purview each Austrian municipality is constitutionally guaranteed to have is a small share of the purview it has in practice. Matters of public services (Daseinsvorsorge) far outclass matters of political administration (Obrigkeitliche Verwaltungs) in terms of both salience and budgets. (Raschauer 2009, Rz 330.)  \n## Regional particularities  \n## Subdivisions  \n<image>Town hall of Markt Piesting, Lower Austria, population ca. 3,000\n\n<image>Town hall of Neufelden, Upper Austria, population ca. 1,300\nThe cities of Vienna, Graz, and Klagenfurt are divided into municipal districts (Stadtbezirke, colloquially just Bezirke).  \nMunicipal districts are not to be confused with administrative districts (politische Bezirke, but colloquially also just called Bezirke).  \nAdministrative districts are provided for by the constitution and play an important and highly visible role in Austria's national and regional administrations. Municipal districts are subsections of local administrations established by local laws.  \nVienna, Graz, and Klagenfurt are statutory cities and as such are equivalent to one administrative district each.  \nThe 23 districts of Vienna (Wiener Gemeindebezirke) and the 17 districts of Graz are vested with a limited form of precinct-level self-government. The district constituency elects a district assembly (Bezirksvertretung), the district assembly in turn elect a district commissioner (Bezirksvorsteher). District assemblies and commissioners are responsible for whatever matters the city chooses to devolve to them – in general, they run schools and take care of road maintenance, general neighborhood maintenance, and traffic planning. They have a certain measure of budgetary autonomy, although they cannot levy taxes and depend on money allocated to them by the city.  \nThe 15 districts of Klagenfurt are roughly neighborhood-sized quarters with no special autonomy.\n\n## Statistics  \nAs of January 1, 2018 there are 15 statutory cities in Austria, 186 other cities, 770 market towns, and 1127 other communes, for a total of 2,098 municipalities. One of these municipalities stands out: the city of Vienna is a statutory city and a state at the same time. At 1,900,000 inhabitants, the national capital also seven times larger than the second most populous city, Graz.  \nFor the other eight states, the numbers are as follows (Statistik Austria 2018):  \nWith respect to population, there is wide variation within each class of municipalities:  \nWith respect to area, the smallest municipality is Rattenberg at sqmi; the largest is Sölden in the thinly populated mountain territory of Tyrol at sqmi. The city of Vienna ranks second, at sqmi.\n\nQuestion: Which town hall is located in a municipality that, as of the provided information, is neither a city nor a market town in Austria?\nChoice list: \nA.

A World Heritage Site, ranked among the top 77 nominees for the New 7 Wonders of Nature.\nEcotourism is a key component of the tourism industry in Costa Rica. By the early 1990s, Costa Rica became known as the poster child of ecotourism. The country is among many developing nations that look to ecotourism as a way of cashing in on the growing demand for this popular trend of travel.  \nEcotourism draws many tourists to visit the extensive national parks and protected areas around the country. Costa Rica was a pioneer in this type of tourism, and the country is recognized as one of the few with true ecotourism. While Costa Rica has gained immense popularity for its development of a successful, yet environmentally friendly, ecotourism industry, environmentalists and economists alike debate whether an economy centered on tourism produces more good than harm.\n\n## Current situation  \nWith its rich biodiversity and immense ecosystem, ecotourism in Costa Rica leads the ranks in this category of tourism. The country takes advantage of the growing demand for eco-tourists to visit these protected areas in exchange for profit. For years, growth in tourism in Central America was extremely slow due to civil wars in various regions; however, as peace developed in neighboring countries, tourism in Costa Rica has skyrocketed over the past two decades.  \nMany of the first ecotourists were academics who came to the country to study biology. The publications generated by of these biologists, coupled with a more aggressive campaign by the Costa Rican Tourism Board (ICT), soon led to a growing group of \"nature tourists.\" By 1995, more than 800,000 foreigners came to Costa Rica, many of whom visited national parks and reserves. The tourism boom began in 1987, with the number of visitors up from 329,000 in 1988, through 1.03 million in 1999, to a historical record of 2.34 million foreign visitors in 2012. In 2012 international tourist receipts reached 2.4 billion. The country is ranked fifth in the world, and first among the Americas, in terms of the 2012 Environmental Performance Index.  \n<image>Costa Rica's biodiversity is an asset for ecotourism. A notable frog species is the red-eyed tree frog.\n\n\n### Location  \nDue to Costa Rica’s position on the world stage, a significant amount of the nation's success in the ecotourism sector can be attributed to its proximity to the United States. In addition, American travelers make up 20% of the world’s tourism market; Costa Rica is an ideal place for Americans to visit. With its favourable climate and advantageous access by the North American market, it illustrates why 49% of foreign visitors come from the United States and another 9% of visitors come from Canada and Mexico. Expatriate American entrepreneurs such as Jim Damalas, Jack Ewing and Michael Kaye were also prominent in building the sector during the late twentieth century.  \n### Higher standard of living  \nIn comparison to other undeveloped regions in the world, Costa Rica ranks relatively high in terms of standard of living. With its high growth rates, economic stability and low crime rates, Costa Rica maintains a per capita GDP of $11,700, literacy rate of 95%, and female life expectancy of nearly 79 years. When comparing Costa Rica to other leading countries in the ecotourism sector, the differences on these indicators are significantly greater. As Julie Dasenbrock put it: “Costa Rica offers a look at a way of life distinct from the modernized world, while allowing tourists to largely avoid the sad realities of poverty in the Third World”.  \n### Local people  \nThe rise of ecotourism in Costa Rica over the past decade has resulted in an extensive expansion in the job market. This has allowed local citizens to generate income and employment, at both the national and local levels: the ecotourism industry has offered residents almost double the monthly income compared to other employment opportunities. Local communities and schools have received significant amounts of investment and donations from visitors, as a result of this expansion, consequently helping to modernize the living conditions endured by the local people. Unfortunately, it cannot be said that all citizens feel as though they have reaped the benefits of a successful economy, as some Costa Ricans “view the growth of tourism as the ‘kidnapping of a nation’ in which they have no say or opportunities to get involved\".  \n## Effects on the environment  \n### Benefits  \n<image>Poás Volcano Crater is one of the country's main tourist attractions.\n\n<image>Birdwatching tours to observe the resplendent quetzal are common in Costa Rica's cloud forests.\nThe environmental benefits of ecotourism in Costa Rica have been far reaching. Initially, this was not the case, but over time ecotourism has come to be seen as a way to preserve natural areas throughout Costa Rica. The interpretation of ecotourism, as a means to conservation, has resulted in various initiatives. The rapid expansion of Costa Rica's national park system in the 1970s and its expansion to include 70 protected areas covering 21% of the nation's territory make up some of these initiatives  \n. Thus, ecotourism has provided greater incentives for natural resource conservation in the form of state-protected areas and private lands. With nearly ½ million acres of land designated as protected areas, tourism in Costa Rica has surged, with scientific and nature tourists from around the world converging on this naturally endowed paradise for tourists.  \nNatural resource conservation has been especially on the rise as ecotourism has acted as an alternative to environmentally damaging industries. Without the market demand and political support for environmental protection, currently protected areas may have fallen to the demands of farming, logging, or mining industries long ago.  \nEcotourism in Costa Rica also encourages individual conservation efforts based on the individual eco-tourist. Ecotourism is meant to both educate and entertain travellers. Thus, “by experiencing first hand the beauty of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve or the majesty of a Red Macaw, tourists may return home wanting to do more to help protect the environment.” Informed tour guides and educational pamphlets can incite tourists to become environmentalists, thereby promoting conservation efforts worldwide.\n\n### Costs  \nEcotourism has contributed significantly to Costa Rica – as both a country and an economy. However, it is also a prime example of ‘ecotourism gone wrong’. In the initial stages of ecotourism in Costa Rica, all stakeholders benefitted from this type of tourism and attention was being paid to the conservation of nature because of the amount of money that was flowing into the country as a result of it. However, as the amount of profit from ecotourism started to rise, the matters of protection of local environment and nature became secondary issues with all the attention focused on profit maximization.  \nVisitor overcapacity is one of the biggest threats to Costa Rica’s natural environments. Although policies in Costa Rica direct eco-tourists into areas designated specifically for that purpose, thereby alleviating the pressure on other more fragile environments, the fact is that even the ecotourism designated environments are becoming more and more fragile. That reality is precisely one of the reasons so many people converge to such areas; they cannot experience such unadulterated nature in their own countries.  \nInadequate enforcement, including limited finances, inadequate local expertise and corruption, has contributed significantly to passive conservation efforts. Oftentimes, because developing nations do not have the resources to train the personnel necessary to efficiently regulate and protect a national park, it results in the progression of environmental degradation to which no one can be held accountable.  For example, “44% of the 3.2 million acres marked for protection remain in the hands of their previous residents and owners. Logging in these areas is often hard to detect or prevent leading some to argue that Costa Rica's natural resources are protected only on paper” (Dulude, 2000). There are extreme shortages in the amount of money necessary to support adequate park management, infrastructure, and programming. Lack of funding, in this respect, has led to problems such as trail deterioration, habitat disruption, pollution, and litter becoming more common.  \n## Effects on the economy  \n### Benefits  \n<image>Two-toed sloth in Manuel Antonio National Park.\n\n<image>Crab-eating raccoon wandering on a beach resort from the nearby Las Baulas National Marine Park.\nCosta Rica has turned to ecotourism as its key to economic development. Since 1984, international tourism receipts have grown from $117 million to $136 million in 1987, and $577 million in 1993. Such phenomenal growth has made tourism the leading source of foreign exchange in Costa Rica.  \nThe growth linkage possibilities of ecotourism development have had, consequently, far reaching effects on other sectors of the economy. For example, “a visit to the Carara Biological Reserve entails not only a $15 entrance fee and possible additional donation, but also a flight into San José's International Airport, a bus ride to the park, a stay in a local hotel, dining in the town's restaurants, and the purchase of souvenirs from street vendors” (TED). To this extent, the ecotourism industry has had a trickle-down effect, bringing added revenues to rural and previously disadvantaged areas.  \nLess obvious growth linkages of ecotourism can affect everything from the communications industry to agriculture. The successes of Costa Rica's ecotourism industry have also helped breathe life into the nation's sagging coffee market. Tourists consume an average of two cups of the nation's gourmet coffee a day adding up to approximately 22 million cups of coffee a year, which, at 75 cents per cup, brings in about $16.5 million. Therefore, as many Latin American nations are losing jobs and revenue to falling coffee prices caused by an influx of cheaper Asian brands into the market, Costa Rica has managed to stay afloat with this increase in domestic consumption.  \nWith a rise in ecotourism and benefits to other industries, locals were relocated and logging industries shut down and Costa Ricans were able to turn to the tourism industry for employment. This would not have been possible if Costa Rica had adhered to former protectionist measures that tended to wall off protected areas from the public.  \nEcotourism in Costa Rica has also helped “diversity the national economy, which previously depended upon the exportation of a few agricultural products, namely coffee, bananas, meat, and sugar, for 65% of its exports.” Like many countries in Central America, Costa Rica's small internal market and scarcity of raw materials make industrialization a slow and difficult process without much room for expansion.\n\n### Costs  \n<image>Canopy walkway in the cloud forest in Santa Elena, Costa Rica\n\n<image>Zip line in the cloud forest near Arenal Volcano\nEcotourism can be source of generating economic development at a local level; however, quite often, it has also resulted in the disruption of local economic activities. As history has shown, ecotourism has not only disrupted local economic activity, but oftentimes, the economic benefits of ecotourism in a particular area do not accrue to the local community. Instead of locals being compensated for switching to professions in the tourism industry, they oftentimes receive jobs that are low paying (although better paying than farming) and limited in their potential for upward mobility as managerial positions go to foreigners or urban-educated elites.  \nProfit leakage and exploitation are other possible factors that could affect the economic viability of Costa Rica tremendously in the future. Many developing nations do not have the resources to construct the infrastructure necessary for tourism development, which leads them to turn to foreign corporations and international donors (Hicks, 2001). The widespread involvement of foreign investors can lead to a leakage problem in which the profits earned by the tourism sector do not stay in the country (Hicks, 2001). This case has been seen to unfold in Costa Rica, where investment is low but new infrastructure is needed, leaving the government no other choice but to resort to foreign aid.\n\n## Potential solutions  \nThe key to a successful ecotourism industry in Costa Rica, which must prevail in all of its individual facets, comes down to better implementation, monitoring and evaluation around the region. In detail, “there needs to be the establishment of a system that considers all aspects of ecotourism ranging from the biophysical to the social”. The complexities surrounding a successful ecotourism industry cannot be understood or solved overnight as there are numerous stakeholders involved and various opinions to take into consideration; there must be a mutual understanding amongst all parties involved as to what a successful ecotourism industry looks like. With that said, more scientific studies related to the biodiversity of the parks, habitat and its disruption, park carrying capacities, pollution, visitation, and other similar issues will need to be conducted.  \nThere is no standard set of guidelines for ecotourism; it is vital that the government of Costa Rica works alongside certification programs to ensure a prosperous environment and economy for the sake of the nation’s future. To illustrate, “the lack of certification poses a significant problem, for it means that ecolodges and other establishments are not answerable as far as the extent and success of their environmental efforts. Recycling programs, promotion of low-impact tourist activities, and support for conservation efforts are entirely voluntary once minimum existing environmental standards have been met”.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts an activity that directly contributes to the economic development of Costa Rica through ecotourism, by offering a unique experience that attracts tourists and generates revenue?\nChoice list: \nA.

Prehistoric settlement in the UAE spanned the Neolithic, with a number of distinctive eras of ancient settlement including the Stone Age Arabian Bifacial and Ubaid cultures from 5,000 to 3,100 BCE; the Hafit period with its distinctive beehive shaped tombs and Jemdet Nasr pottery, from 3,200 to 2,600 BCE; the Umm Al Nar period from 2,600 to 2,000 BCE; the Wadi Suq culture from 2,000–1,300 BCE and the three Iron Ages of the UAE.  \nThe UAE's Iron Age I spanned 1,200–1,000 BCE; Iron Age II, 1,000–600 BCE and Iron Age III from 600–300 BCE. This was followed by the Hellenistic Mleiha (or Late Pre-Islamic) era, from 300 BCE onwards through to the Islamic era which commenced with the culmination of the 7th century Ridda Wars.  \nThe remains of settlements, burials and other extensive evidence of human habitation throughout these eras is littered throughout the UAE, with many extensive finds of rich materials in the shape of pottery, jewellery, weapons and both human and animal remains providing archaeologists and researchers with an increasingly sophisticated picture of longstanding involvement in regional trade alongside nomadic cultures eking out a living from the frequently arid and inhospitable desert and mountain environment of the UAE.  \nThe first modern digs to take place in the Trucial States were led by teams from the Danish Moesgaard Museum in 1959 and focused on the island of Umm Al Nar before going on to investigate the beehive tombs in and around the area of Al Ain (then often still known as Buraimi) in the emirate of Abu Dhabi.  \n## First discovery  \n<image>The Iron Age building at Jebel Buhais\nThe first archaeological excavations in the UAE were in 1959, led by Peter Glob and his assistant Geoffrey Bibby. Glob was a professor at Aarhus University and director of its Moesgaard Museum. He had undertaken a series of digs in Bahrain and was contacted by the director of Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd, an oil company, Temple Hillyard, who invited them to visit some graves he had found on the small island of Umm Al Nar (then referred to as Umm an-Nar), having been directed to the site by the then-Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan. Hillyard had already determined that the tumuli were'reminiscent of the Bronze Age one in Bahrain'. During excavations at Umm Al Nar, the Ruler's brother, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan visited the dig and told the archaeologists that there were many more such artefacts in Al Ain. He invited them to visit him and led them to a group of some 200 burial cairns – what would later turn out to be Hafit period burials. Zayed later took members of the Danish team to other sites in the area, including a low tell which is now known as Rumailah, a significant Iron Age site.  \nSubsequent excavations by teams from Iraq in the 1970s unveiled the Jebel Buhais site, as well as the hugely significant ancient city of Ed-Dur. Since then, digs have taken place around the UAE by teams from universities in France, Spain, Germany, Jordan, Australia, and the UK.\n\n## Prehistory  \nThe Mleiha Archaeological Centre displays evidence of the oldest archaeological finds in the UAE, the prehistoric Faya-1 collection, which dates human occupation in the area to 130,000–120,000 BCE, and has been linked to the movement of the first anthropologically modern humans from Africa to populate the world, before finds of a yet earlier date (50,000 years) had been found at Misliya cave in the Southern Levant. The Faya discovery, made in 2011, includes primitive hand-axes, as well as several kinds of scrapers and perforators, which resemble those used by early modern humans in East Africa. Through the technique of thermoluminescence dating the artefacts were placed at 125,000 years old. Before the discovery in the Levant, this had been the earliest evidence of modern humans found anywhere outside Africa, and implies modern humans left Africa much earlier than previously thought. Mleiha is also the site of Neolithic as well as Umm Al Nar period burials, and gives its name to the Hellenistic Mleiha period (now more commonly referred to as the 'Pre-Islamic'), from 300 BCE onwards, characterised by the extensive fortified compound, 'Mleiha Fort', which was discovered in the late 1990s and is thought to have been possibly the seat of an ancient South Arabian kingdom. Recent (2017) studies using Ground Penetrating Radar have uncovered significant unexcavated PIR era buildings and structures in the area around Mleiha.  \nThe oldest radiometrically dated inland burial site in the UAE is the extensive necropolis at Jebel Buhais. The site, located near Madam, in Sharjah, consists of burial sites spanning the Stone, Bronze, Iron and pre-Islamic ages of human settlement in the UAE. Burials at Jebel Buhais (Jebel is Arabic for mountain) date back to the 5th millennium BCE.  \n## Arabian bifacial  \nDuring the glacial maximum period, 68,000 to 8,000 BCE, Eastern Arabia is thought to have been uninhabitable. Finds from the stone age Arabian Bifacial and Ubaid cultures (including knapped stone arrow and axe heads as well as Ubaid pottery) show human habitation in the area from 5000 to 3100 BCE. The archaeological record shows that Arabian Bifacial/Ubaid period came to an abrupt end in eastern Arabia and the Oman peninsula at 3800 BC, just after the phase of lake lowering and onset of dune reactivation.  There is no evidence of human presence in the area for approximately 1,000 years, the so-called \"Dark Millennium\". This is thought to be consistent with changing patterns of human life as a result of climate change: a spring discovered at Jebel Buhais dried up at this stage, an event contemporaneous with similar discoveries pointing to increased aridity in the interior of Oman. Throughout Southern Arabia, evidence of human inland settlement in the 3rd millennium BCE is scant.  \n## Ed-Dur  \nOne of the most significant archaeological sites in the UAE is that at Ed-Dur, an Ancient Near Eastern City located in Umm Al Qawain. One of the largest sites in the country, comprising an area of some five kilometres, the coastal settlement overlooks the Al Beidha Lake. It has been dubbed 'one of the most significant lost cities of Arabia'. It was first discovered by an Iraqi archaeological team in 1973 and first dug in 1974. Subsequent digs have unearthed evidence of human habitation spanning the Ubeid period, Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Pre-Islamic period. During the latter period the settlement appears to have been at its most prosperous and the hills of the area were entirely covered with dozens of buildings and thousands of stone-built tombs. Some 500 of these tombs have been excavated, with grave goods discovered including drinking sets, Roman glass, weaponry, pottery, jewelry and ivory objects. It is thought some 20,000 tombs are on the site in all. Similarly, the necropolis of Jebel Buhais spans a remarkable period, with burials evident as far back as the fifth millennium BCE, while Mleiha also represents human settlement dating back some 7,000 years.  \n## Hafit period  \n<image>Hafit period beehive tomb at Jebel Hafit\nThe Hafit period is marked by (and named for) the distinctive 'beehive' tombs first discovered around the area of Jebel Hafit in Al Ain. The period defines early Bronze Age human settlement in the United Arab Emirates and Oman in the period from 3,200 to 2,600 BC. Hafit period tombs and remains have also been located across the UAE and Oman in sites such as Bidaa bint Saud, Jebel Buhais and Buraimi in the UAE and Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn in Oman.  \nThe first find of Hafit era tombs is attributed to the Danish archaeologist P.V. Glob of the Moesgaard Museum (who also investigated Umm Al Nar) in 1959, and the first of many excavations of these took place a few years later. uncovering the remains of some 317 circular stone tombs and settlements from the Hafit period, as well as wells and partially underground falaj irrigation systems, and mud brick constructions intended for a range of defensive, domestic and economic purposes. The Al Ain Oasis, in particular, provides evidence of construction and water management enabling the early development of agriculture for five millennia, up until the present day.  \nPottery finds at Hafit period sites demonstrate trading links to Mesopotamia, contiguous to the Jemdat Nasr period (3100–2900 BC). Evidence of trading links with Mesopotamia are also found in the subsequent Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods of UAE history.\n\n## Umm Al Nar period  \n<image>Umm Al Nar period terracotta bottle on display at the Louvre, Abu Dhabi.\nThe Bronze Age Umm Al Nar period spans the period 2600–2000 BCE. The name is derived from the first excavations which took place at Umm Al Nar, an island on the coast of Abu Dhabi, in 1959. The distinctive circular tombs of the Umm Al Nar period distinguish it from the preceding Hafit period, together with finds of distinctive black on red decorated pottery and jewellery made with gems such as carnelian, sourced from the Indus Valley.  \nSeven tombs from a total of fifty and three areas at the ruins of the ancient settlement were examined by the Danish archaeologists in the 1959 season. During their first visit they identified a few exposed shaped stones fitted together at some of the stone mounds. The following year, the first excavations started at one of the mounds on the plateau, now called Tomb I. Two more seasons (1960 and 1961) involved digging more tombs, while the last three seasons (1962–63, 1964 and 1965) were allocated to examining the settlement.  \nThe Danish excavations at Umm Al Nar halted in 1965 but work resumed in 1975 by an archaeological team from Iraq. During the Iraqi excavations which lasted one season, five tombs were excavated and a small section of the village was examined. Between 1970 and 1972 an Iraqi restoration team headed by Shah Al Siwani, former member of the Antiquities Director in Baghdad, restored and/or reconstructed the Danish excavated tombs.\n<image>Umm Al Nar tomb at Mleiha\nAt Al Sufouh Archaeological Site in Dubai, archaeological excavation between 1994 and 1995, revealing an Umm Al Nar type circular tomb dating between 2500 and 2000 B.C. Dubai Municipality and the Sanisera Archaeology Institute conducted excavations at the site of Al Ashoosh between November 2015 and May 2016. The site was discovered during two seasons of survey in 2002–2003 following the discovery of the nearby Iron Age metallurgical centre Saruq Al Hadid, and is located 8 km from that site.  \nSurveys in the area by Dubai Municipality and the Department of Antiquities of Jordan identified 33 archaeological sites ranging in date from prehistory to the late Islamic period. In 2006–2007, more-detailed archaeological investigations of the area of Al-Ashoosh were conducted, including survey, excavation and geological sampling.  \nAt Tell Abraq, settlements associated with the start of the Umm Al Nar culture began c. 2500 BC. Finds at Shimal and Ed Dur also point to a transitional period between the Umm Al Nar and following Wadi Suq periods. The excavations at Shimal, principally those of the mid-1980s by a team from the University of Göttingen in Germany, are significant as they provided early evidence of the 'Wadi Suq' period, including finds of pottery, soft-stone vessels, bronze and copper weapons and beads which came to be regarded as typical of the period c. 2000–1300 BC in the UAE.\n\n## Wadi Suq period  \n<image>Wadi Suq burial at Shimal, Ras Al Khaimah\nThe Wadi Suq culture flourished in the period from 2,000 to 1,300 BCE. It takes its name from a wadi, or waterway, East of Sohar in Oman. Rather than a seismic cultural shift, a gradual change in human society which is centred around more sophisticated approaches to animal husbandry, particularly the domestication of the camel, as well as changes in the surrounding trade and social environments, took place between the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods. The transition between Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq is thought to have taken some 200 years and more, with finds at the important Wadi Suq site of Tell Abraq in modern Umm Al Quwain showing evidence of the continuity of Umm al-Nar burials. At Qattara Oasis in Al Ain, the Wadi Suq communal tomb is thought to have been constructed from stones recovered from previous Umm Al Nar burials.  \nEvidence of increased mobility among the population points to a gradual change in human habits rather than sudden change and important Wadi Suq era sites such as Tell Abraq, Ed Dur, Seih Al Harf, Shimal and Kalba show an increasing sophistication in copper and bronze ware as well as trade links both east to the Indus Valley and west to Mesopotamia.  \nChanges in two important trading partners also took place during this period, with the Mesopotamian city of Ur falling to Elam in 2,000 BC and the decline of the Indus Valley Harappan Culture in 1,800 BC. The abandonment of the port of Umm Al Nar took place at around this time.\n<image>Wadi Suq burial at Jebel Buhais\nThe Wadi Suq site at Seih Al Harf in Ras Al Khaimah was first excavated by a team from the University of Durham, led by Derek Kennet, in the spring of 2013. The site comprises a series of 50 burial sites, of which two were directly threatened by road development, an 18-metre horseshoe shaped and a W-shaped tomb. Both were collective graves. Ten other excavated features were also impacted by the road development. Although the site was seen to be threatened by the development of the northern extension of the arterial Emirates Road (E611), with proposals tabled to amend the road development to avoid damage to the site, the road project went ahead.  \nA number of Wadi Suq and Iron Age discoveries were made in the mountain village of Bithnah in Fujairah, first excavated by the Swiss-Liechtenstein Foundation for Archaeological Research Abroad (SLFA) between 1987 and 1991. Presided over by Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, and directed in the field by Pierre Corboud, the SLFA team conducted several seasons of survey in the mountainous inland area of Fujairah, including the excavations at Bithnah, where a communal grave site was uncovered as well as a number of Iron Age finds. There have also been excavations by teams from the University of Geneva and French National Research Centre. Significant Iron Age finds have been made throughout the area, including a number of petroglyphs.\n\n## Iron Age  \nFrom 1,200 BC to the advent of Islam in Eastern Arabia, through three distinctive Iron Ages (Iron Age 1, 1200–1000 BC; Iron Age II, 1000–600 BC and Iron Age III 600–300 BC) and the Hellenistic Mleiha period (300 BC onward), the area was variously occupied by Archaemenid and other forces and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the falaj irrigation system (also called qanat). Early finds of aflaj, particularly those around the desert city of Al Ain, have been cited as the earliest evidence of the construction of these waterways. It is thought nearby Bidaa bint Saud became an important site during the Iron Age, both as a caravan stop and as a settled community of farmers that used the falaj irrigation system there. Two of these irrigation passages have been partly excavated at Bidaa bin Saud, with a number of sections remaining in reasonable condition. In one of the excavations, a number of sandstone-lined shaft holes were discovered, as well as a stepped underground access point and a large open cistern. Evidence of formerly irrigated land has also been found at the site.  \n<image>Snake decoration on a pot from Rumailah\nImportant Iron Age centres in the UAE have rendered an unusual richness in finds to archaeologists, particularly the spectacular metallurgical centre of Saruq Al Hadid in what is today Dubai. Other important Iron Age settlements in the country include Al Thuqeibah, Madam, Bidaa bint Saud, Ed-Dur and Tell Abraq.\n\n### Iron age aflaj  \nRecent finds of pottery in Thuqeibah and Madam have further linked the development of early aflaj (or qanat) water systems there to an Iron Age II date, further substantiating the attribution of the innovation of these water systems to a southeastern Arabian origin based on the extensive archaeological work of Dr Wasim Takriti around the area of Al Ain.  \nThe 2002 publication of a paper by Tikriti, The south-east Arabian origin of the falaj system, provided the first counterpoint to the long-accepted narrative, that the Qanat originated in Persia and was identified as such by accounts of the campaigns of the Assyrian King, Sargon II, in 714 BCE. Tikriti cites this and also accounts by the Greek second and third century historian Polybius as being the basis for academic attribution of the technology to Persia. He notes academics such as JC Wilkinson (1977) adopting an Iranian origin for the technology under the influence of Sargon's annals and Polybius, but points out at least seven Iron Age aflaj (plural for falaj, the word used to denote waterways of this type in the United Arab Emirates) recently discovered in the Al Ain area of the UAE have been reliably carbon dated back to the beginning of the first millennium BCE. Additional to finds of Iron Age aflaj in Al Ain, Tikrit pointed to excavations in Al Madam, Sharjah, by the French archaeological team working there, as well as by a German team working in Maysar, in Oman. Tikriti is at pains to point out that, despite long-standing efforts since the 19th century to excavate qanat systems in Iran, no evidence has been found for any such qanat there dated earlier than the 5th century BCE. He concludes that the technology originated in South East Arabia and was likely taken to Persia, likely by the Sasanian conquest of the Oman peninsular.  \nOthers have followed Tikriti's lead. In 2016, Rémy Boucharlat in his paper Qanāt and Falaj: Polycentric and Multi-Period Innovations Iran and the United Arab Emirates as Case Studies, asserted that the attribution of the technology to Iranians in the early first millennium BCE is a position that cannot longer be maintained. He asserts that the carbon dating of alfaj in Oman and the UAE to the ninth century BCE by Cleuziou and evidence for such an early date provided by Tikriti are definitive. Additionally, Boucharlat maintains that no known Iranian qanat can be dated to the pre-Islamic period.  \n### Burials  \nIron Age burials at Jebel Buhais, particularly the group of graves defined as BHS 85, are thought to be linked to the nearby Iron Age settlement site of Al Thuqeibah. The site was originally excavated by teams from the Autonomous University of Madrid in the mid-1990s. Thuqeibah has been dated from the Iron Age II and III periods (1100–400 BC). A settlement consisting of a number of houses and a well, it has been associated with a nearby Iron Age falaj system, thought to date from the Iron Age II era. 1st Millennium aflaj have also been unearthed at nearby Al Madam.  \n<image>Iron Age dagger from Qattara\nThe site of Rumailah, in Al Ain, like many in the UAE spans a wide period with finds dating back to the Umm Al Nar period, but shows a flourishing during the Iron Age. Finds at Rumailah include distinctive pottery adorned with snake patterns, similar to finds at Qusais, Masafi and the major Iron and Bronze Ages; metallurgical production centre at Saruq Al Hadid, as well as chlorite vessels decorated with turtles alternating with trees, similar to finds from Qidfa' in Fujairah, Qusais in Dubai and Al-Hajar in Bahrain. A number of Iron Age swords and axe-heads, as well as distinctive seal moulds, were also recovered from the site. A number of bronze arrowheads were also found at the site. The Iron Age buildings found at Rumailah are typical of those found in the region, at Iron Age I and II sites such as Al Thuqeibah and Muweilah, with a number of row dwellings, although lacking the perimeter walls found at Thuqeibah. A columned hall at Rumailah provides a further link to Muweilah, while a number of pyramidal seals found at Rumailah find an echo with similar objects discovered at Bidaa bint Saud.  \nOne of the most significant Iron Age sites in the UAE is Muweilah, located in the Sharjah suburb of Al Jurainah, near Sharjah University City. A large, fortified settlement thought to have been occupied during the Iron Age II period (1100–600BC), the site has been explored by archaeologists since Muweilah was first identified in a survey conducted by the French Mission to the UAE in 1989, and excavated by an Australian expedition, which started work there in 1994 after the discovery of pottery shards by a local resident. It has yielded the oldest known example of writing found to date in the UAE, a pottery shard with an inscription, thought to be Sabean, with the letters 'bml'.\n\n## Saruq Al Hadid  \n<image>Gold jewelry from Saruq Al Hadid\nThe Saruq Al Hadid site in the desert south of Dubai was a centre of constant human habitation, trade and metallurgy from the Umm Al Nar period (2600–2000 BCE) to 1,000 BCE, when it was a major location for smelting bronze, copper and Iron. Arguably its most important period of flourishing was as a metallurgical centre in the Iron Age II period (1100–600 BCE). One of the many thousands of finds to be documented at the site was an ornate gold ring, which became the inspiration for Dubai's Expo 2020 logo.  \nSome of the many enigmas surrounding the site are its location far from sources of water, ore or firewood, all critical elements to a metallurgical centre. An abundance of pottery and metal artifacts have given rise to speculation of possibly identifying the site as a centre of snake worship. In all, over 12,000 unique objects have been unearthed at the site. A number of key finds are on public display at Dubai's Saruq Al Hadid Archaeology Museum in Al Shindagha, housed in a traditional barjeel (wind tower) building constructed in 1928 by Sheikh Juma bin Maktoum Al Maktoum.\n\n## Pre-Islamic Recent  \nArchaeologists have relatively recently defined a stratification of the pre-Islamic (previously sometimes referred to as 'Hellenistic') era in the Emirates' archaeology into four distinct Pre-Islamic Recent ages: PIR A (350 BCE - 150 BCE); PIR B (150-0 BCE); PIR C (0 BCE to 100 CE) and PIR D (100CE - 350 CE). These definitions have been applied particularly to sites where constant phases of occupation and disruption occur in the pre-Islamic, post Iron-Age era such as Mleiha in Sharjah and the related site of Ed Dur in Umm Al Quwain.  \n## Post-Islamic finds  \nArchaeologists have worked on post-Islamic era sites across the UAE, particularly in Ras Al Khaimah (the coastal settlement of Julphar) and the East Coast. On the East Coast, in Fujairah, the village of Bidayah has been the focus of a number of explorations of its mosque and the remains of a Portuguese fort, discovered in the village by a team of Australian archaeologists. The fort, originally called 'Libidia', was identified from a 16th-century map. Its walls were constructed using rock recovered from a nearby tower dated back to the third millennium BCE. These walls, some 60 metres in length, are joined in a square with towers on each corner and stand today at a height of up to a meter. Finds at the site of the fort include locally made pottery dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries and charcoal samples unearthed were carbon dated to 1450–1600, within the context of the Portuguese presence in the Gulf.  \nThe Bidayah mosque's date of construction is uncertain and because the mud and stone built structure uses no wood, radiocarbon dating is not possible. It is estimated to date to the 15th century, however some much earlier estimates have been proposed. The site was investigated by the archaeological center of Fujairah in co-operation with the University of Sydney from 1997–98. and Fujairah Archaeology and Heritage Department came up with the conclusion that the mosque was believed to be built in 1446 AD, along with the two watch towers overlooking the mosque and the village.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts an artifact from the Umm Al Nar period?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Products of conception  \n<image>Micrograph of products of conception. Chorionic villi (right of image) and cartilage, i.e. fetal parts (left of image). H&E stain.\nProducts of conception, abbreviated POC, is a medical term used for the tissue derived from the union of an egg and a sperm. It encompasses anembryonic gestation (blighted ovum) which does not have a viable embryo.  \nIn the context of tissue from a dilation and curettage, the presence of POC essentially excludes an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n## Retained products of conception  \nRetained products of conception is where products of conception remain in the uterus after childbirth, medical abortion or miscarriage (also known as spontaneous abortion). Miscarriage with retained products of conception is termed delayed when no or very little products of conception have been passed, and incomplete when some products have been passed but some still remain in utero.  \n## Diagnosis  \n<image>On gross pathology, the presence of chorionic villi (left) is diagnostic of products of conception, whereas decidua (right) is not.\nThe diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, quantitative HCG, ultrasound, and pathologic evaluation. A solid, heterogeneous, echogenic mass has a positive predictive value of 80%, but is present in only a minority of cases. A thickened endometrium of > 10 mm is usually considered abnormal, though no consensus exists on the appropriate cutoff. A cut-off of 8 mm or more has 34% positive rate, while a cut off of 14 mm or more has 85% sensitivity, 64% specificity for the diagnosis. Color Doppler flow in the endometrial canal can increased confidence in the diagnosis, though its absence does not exclude it, as 40% of cases of retained products have little or no flow. The differential in suspected cases includes uterine atony, blood clot, gestational trophoblastic disease, and normal post partum appearance of the uterus. Post partum blood clot is more common, reported in up to 24% of postpartum patients, and tends to be more hypoechoic than retained products with absent color flow on Doppler, and resolving spontaneously on follow up scans. The presence of gas raises the possibility of post partum endometritis, though this can also be seen in up to 21% of normal post pregnancy states. The normal post partum uterus is usually less than 2 cm in thickness, and continues to involute on follow up scans to 7 mm or less over time. Retained products are not uncommon, occurring in approximately 1% of all pregnancies, though it more common following abortions, either elective or spontaneous. There is significant overlap between appearance of a normal post partum uterus and retained products.  If there is no endometrial canal mass or fluid, and endometrial thickness is less than 10 mm and without increased flow, retained products are statistically unlikely.\n\n### Infections  \nRecent studies indicate that the products of conception may be susceptible to pathogenic infections, including viral infections. Indeed, footprints of JC polyomavirus and Merkel cell polyomavirus have been detected in chorionic villi from females affected by spontaneous abortion as well as pregnant women. Another virus, BK polyomavirus has been detected in the same tissues, but with lesser extent.  \n## Treatment  \n### After medical abortion  \nAccording to the 2006 WHO Frequently asked clinical questions about medical abortion, the presence of remaining products of conception in the uterus (as detected by obstetric ultrasonography) after a medical abortion is not an indication for surgical intervention (that is, vacuum aspiration or dilation and curettage). Remaining products of conception will be expelled during subsequent vaginal bleeding. Still, surgical intervention may be carried out on the woman's request, if the bleeding is heavy or prolonged, or causes anemia, or if there is evidence of endometritis.  \n### In delayed miscarriage  \nIn delayed miscarriage (also called missed abortion), the Royal Women's Hospital recommendations of management depend on the findings in ultrasonography:  \n* Gestational sac greater than 30-35mm, embryo larger than ~25mm (corresponding to 9+0 weeks of gestational age): Surgery is recommended. It poses a high risk of pain and bleeding with passage of products of conception. Alternative methods may still be considered.  \n* Gestational sac 15-35mm, embryo smaller than 25mm (corresponding to between 7 and 9+0 weeks of gestational age): Medication is recommended. Surgery or expectant management may be considered.  \n* Gestational sac smaller than 15-20mm, corresponding to a gestational age of less than 7 weeks: Expectant management or medication is preferable. The products of conception may be difficult to find surgically with a considerable risk of failed surgical procedure.  \n### In incomplete miscarriage  \nIn incomplete miscarriage, the Royal Women's Hospital recommendations of management depend on the findings in ultrasonography:  \n* Retained products of conception smaller than 15mm: Expectant management is generally preferable. There is a high chance of spontaneous expulsion.  \n* Retained products of conception measuring between 15 and 20mm: Medical or expectant management are recommended. Surgery should only be considered upon specific indication.  \n* At retained products of conception measuring over 35 to 50mm, the following measures are recommended:  \n* Administration of misoprostol to hasten passage of products of conception.  \n* Admission to inpatient care for observation for a few hours or overnight until the majority of the products of conception has passed and bleeding subsided.  \n* After apparent failure of misoprostol, a gynecologic examination should be done prior to considering surgical evacuation of the uterus or the patient leaving the\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is supported by the information provided in the images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA. Chorionic villi are indicative of an ectopic pregnancy.\nB. The presence of decidua alone is diagnostic of products of conception.\nC. Products of conception include both chorionic villi and fetal parts, which can be identified in a micrograph.\nD.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Casey Hayward  \nCasey Hayward Jr. (born September 9, 1989) is an American football cornerback who is a free agent. He played college football at Vanderbilt. Hayward was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the second round of the 2012 NFL Draft and has played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Packers, San Diego / Los Angeles Chargers, Las Vegas Raiders, and Atlanta Falcons.  \n## High school career  \nHayward attended Perry High School, where he was a three-sport star in football, basketball and track. In football, he was a three-year starter at quarterback and also played several games at cornerback. As a senior, he led his team to the state quarterfinals by passing for 1,300 yards and 18 touchdowns as well as rushing for 1,284 yards and another 18 touchdowns. He also had four interceptions, three of which he returned for touchdowns. His performance had him named the Region 4-AAA Player of the Year. He was also named an All-State defensive back and an All-middle Georgia player. Hayward was also a member of the team's leadership council and a starting guard in basketball.  \nAs an outstanding track & field athlete, Hayward excelled in sprints and jumps. At the 2008 Patriot Invitational, he earned a second-place finish in the triple jump event, posting a career-best leap of 13.93 meters (45 ft, 6 in), while also placing twelfth in the 100-meter dash, with a time of 11.48 seconds. He recorded a personal-best leap of 6.83 meters (22 ft, 3 in) in the long jump at the Harmon Invitational, where he took gold. He also ran a PR of 22.75 seconds in the 200-meter dash. In addition, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.43 seconds, bench-pressed 255 pounds, squatted 400 pounds and had a 33-inch vertical.  \nComing out of high school, Hayward was measured to be 6 ft. 1 in. and 185 pounds.  He received very few scholarship offers from division schools, which he attributed to being \"strictly a quarterback\". He was scouted by Georgia Tech, Louisville, Middle Tennessee State, North Carolina, Southern Miss, and Troy.  \n## College career  \nHayward ultimately chose to attend Vanderbilt University because of the school's academic ranking and the fact that the school is a member of the Southeastern Conference. He immediately played during his freshman year and made his permanent move to cornerback as a Nickelback and also on special teams.  \nIn 2009, he was promoted to the starting role and played in every game, although he did miss most of two games due to injury. He was named the defensive player of the week against LSU after contributing 13 tackles (eight solo) with 4 for a loss. He was also named the team's most valuable defensive back.  \nHayward continued to make an impact going into 2010 and started every game of the season. He had six interceptions, 70 tackles (59 solo), and 17 passes defended. He ranked first in the SEC and 3rd in the NCAA for passes defended. His performance earned him a spot on the second-team All-SEC as a defensive back by the coaches and media.  \nDuring his final season as a Vanderbilt Commodore, Hayward tied the career record for interceptions at 15 (also held by Leonard Coleman). He also made 62 tackles, and had seven interceptions, the third highest single season total by a Vanderbilt player. He was named a mid-season All-American by Sports Illustrated. At the end of the season, Hayward was named a second-team All-American by the Walter Camp Foundation, becoming the first Vanderbilt All-American in four years.  \n## Professional career  \nOn January 9, 2012, it was announced that Hayward had accepted his invitation to play in the 2012 Senior Bowl. On January 28, 2012, he made a pass deflection and intercepted a pass by Michigan State quarterback Kirk Cousins as part of Washington Redskins' head coach Mike Shanahan's South team that lost 23–13 to the North. Hayward was one of 59 collegiate defensive backs to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. He completed all of the combine drills, finishing tied for tenth in the bench press among his position group and 25th in the 40-yard dash. On March 23, 2012, Hayward attended Vanderbilt's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only performed positional drills. Scouts praised his intelligence and instincts as well as his ability to recognize routes. They also stated that he was a good tackler with good footwork and durability. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Hayward was projected to be a second or third round pick by NFL draft experts and analysts. He was ranked the fourth best cornerback prospect by NFL analyst Mike Mayock, was ranked the ninth best cornerback by NFLDraftScout.com, and was ranked the 12th best cornerback by NFL analyst Gil Brandt.  \n### Green Bay Packers  \n#### 2012  \nThe Green Bay Packers selected Hayward in the second round (62nd overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft. He was the fifth cornerback selected in 2012 and Vanderbilt's highest defensive back drafted since Fred Vinson in 1999.  \nOn May 11, 2012, the Green Bay Packers signed Hayward to a four-year, $3.30 million contract that includes $1.03 million guaranteed and a $847,208 signing bonus.  \nHayward entered training camp competing against Jarrett Bush, Sam Shields, and Davon House for the vacant starting cornerback spot after veteran Charles Woodson was moved to strong safety to replace Nick Collins, who was released due to health concerns. Head coach Mike McCarthy named Hayward the third cornerback on the Packers' depth chart, behind Sam Shields and Tramon Williams.  \nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Green Bay Packers' season-opener against the San Francisco 49ers and recorded one tackle in their 30–23 loss. On October 7, 2012, Hayward recorded two combined tackles, broke up a pass, and made his first career interception during the Packers' 30–27 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. He intercepted a pass attempt by Andrew Luck that was originally intended for Reggie Wayne to seal the victory in the fourth quarter. The following week, Hayward broke up three passes and intercepted two passes from Matt Schaub and T. J. Yates during the Packers' 42–24 victory at the Houston Texans. In Week 7, Hayward earned his first career start after Sam Shields was unable to play following a shin and knee injury. Hayward went on to record three solo tackles, a pass deflection, and an interception in a 30–20 victory at the St. Louis Rams. During the month of October 2012, he won the NFL defensive Rookie of the Month, having intercepted four passes three games. He finished third for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and was named to the NFL All-Joes team.  \n<image>Hayward with the Packers in 2015.\nIn Week 8, Hayward recorded a season-high eight combined tackles in the Packers' 24–15 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He finished his rookie season in 2012 with 53 combined tackles (40 solo), 22 pass deflections, and six interceptions in 16 games.  \nThe Green Bay Packers finished first in the NFC North with an 11–5 record and received a playoff berth. On January 5, 2013, Hayward played in his first career playoff game and collected four solo tackles in the 24–10 win against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Wildcard game. The Packers were defeated 45–31 by the San Francisco 49ers the following game. Hayward earned the highest overall grade of any slot corner ever graded by Pro Football Focus.\n\n#### 2013  \nDefensive coordinator Dom Capers and cornerbacks coach Joe Whitt Jr. held an open competition to name the starting cornerbacks for the regular season. Davon House, Tramon Williams, Sam Shields, and Hayward all competed for the starting roles. He fell behind in training camp following a hamstring injury that sidelined him for two weeks. Head coach Mike McCarthy named Hayward the third cornerback behind Williams and Shields to begin the regular season.  \nOn August 23, 2013, Hayward returned for the third preseason game and recorded a tackle, a pass deflection, and made an interception before leaving the 17–10 loss to the Seattle Seahawks after aggravating his hamstring injury. He missed the last preseason game and first six regular season games (Weeks 1–6) with a hamstring injury. He returned in Week 8 and recorded a tackle in the Packers' 44–31 victory at the Minnesota Vikings. The following week, Hayward collected a season-high seven combined tackles in a 27–20 loss to the Chicago Bears. On November 23, 2013, the Green Bay Packers placed Hayward on injured reserve for the remainder of the season. He finished the 2013 season with eight combined tackles (five solo) in three games and one start.  \n#### 2014  \nThroughout training camp in 2014, Hayward competed for the third and fourth cornerback positions against Davon House and Micah Hyde. He was named the third cornerback on the depth chart behind Sam Shields and Tramon Williams.  \nOn October 26, 2014, Hayward recorded a season-high six combined tackles during a 44–23 loss at the New Orleans Saints. On November 9, 2014, he collected three solo tackles, a pass deflection, and returned an interception for an 82-yard touchdown as the Packers routed the Chicago Bears 54–14. It marked the first touchdown of Hayward's career. He finished the 2014 season with 42 combined tackles (33 solo), seven pass deflections, and 3 interceptions in 16 games and one start.  \n#### 2015  \nHayward entered training camp in 2015 slated as the starting cornerback opposite Sam Shields after Tramon Williams and Davon House departed during free agency. Head coach Mike McCarthy named Hayward and Shields the starting cornerback, ahead of rookies Damarious Randall and Quinten Rollins. On November 1, 2015, Hayward recorded a season-high seven combined tackles and three pass deflections during a 29–10 loss at the Denver Broncos. Hayward finished the 2015 season with a career-high 65 combined tackles (56 solo) and seven pass deflections in 16 games and 11 starts. The Green Bay Packers finished the season with a 10–6 record and second in their division. On January 10, 2016, Hayward started his first career playoff game and collected seven combined tackles and a pass deflection in a 35–18 win at the Washington Redskins. They were eliminated after being defeated by the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Divisional round.  \nHe played outside corner during the majority of the season, but also played nickelback when Damarious Randall was used on the outside with Shields. Hayward led all Packers' cornerbacks in tackles and with 908 snaps on defense.  \n#### 2016  \nHayward became an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career after the Green Bay Packers decided not to offer him a new contract despite a career-high number of tackles and starts in 2015. The decision surprised Hayward and Aaron Rodgers but was considered reasonable by members of Packers media coverage. He received interest from a few teams, including the San Francisco 49ers, Arizona Cardinals, Dallas Cowboys,  \nand San Diego Chargers.  \n### San Diego / Los Angeles Chargers  \n#### 2016  \nOn March 13, 2016, the San Diego Chargers signed Hayward to a three-year, $15.30 million contract that includes $6.80 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.50 million.  \nThroughout training camp, Hayward competed for the job as the starting outside cornerback against Brandon Flowers. Head coach Mike McCoy named Hayward the starting nickelback to begin the regular season. He was also named the third cornerback on the depth chart, behind Jason Verrett and Brandon Flowers.  \nHe started the San Diego Chargers' season-opener and made his Chargers' regular season debut at the Kansas City Chiefs. He recorded four combined tackles and defended two passes in the Chargers' 33–27 loss. The next week, Hayward collected four solo tackles, two pass break ups, and intercepted Jacksonville Jaguars' quarterback Blake Bortles twice in their 38–14 victory. In Week 5, Hayward collected a season-high eight solo tackles in San Diego's 34–31 loss at the Oakland Raiders. On October 30, 2016, he recorded three combined tackles, deflected three passes, and returned an interception for a 24-yard touchdown in a 27–19 loss at the Denver Broncos. On December 20, 2016, he was named to his first Pro Bowl. Hayward finished the 2016 season with 58 combined tackles (51 solo), 20 pass deflections, seven interceptions, and a touchdown in 16 games and 14 starts. He finished first in the league with seven interceptions and second with 20 passes defensed and was named second-team All-Pro. He was also ranked 64th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017. The San Diego Chargers finished last in the AFC West with a 5–11 record and head coach Mike McCoy was fired. The team also relocated to Los Angeles during the off season.  \n#### 2017  \nFormer Buffalo Bills' offensive coordinator Anthony Lynn was hired as the Chargers' new head coach. Hayward entered camp as the de facto starting cornerback after Brandon Flowers was released. Head coach Anthony Lynn officially named Hayward and Jason Verrett the starting cornerbacks to start the regular season.  \nHayward started the Los Angeles Chargers' season-opener against the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football and recorded four combined tackles, a pass break up, and fumble recovery during their 24–21 loss. During the third quarter, Hayward recovered a fumble by Jamaal Charles after it was forced by Chargers' linebacker Korey Toomer. The following week, Hayward collected a season-high five combined tackles in the Chargers' 19–17 loss to the Miami Dolphins. On November 19, 2017, he made four solo tackles, three pass deflections, and intercepted Nathan Peterman twice as the Chargers routed the Buffalo Bills 54–24. On December 19, 2017, Hayward was named to his second Pro Bowl. He finished the 2017 season with a total of 40 combined tackles (33 solo), a career-high 22 pass break ups, and four interceptions in 16 games and 16 starts. Pro Football Focus gave Hayward an overall grade of 96.4. His overall grade was first among all qualifying cornerbacks for 2017 and PFF also voted him the top coverage defender of the season. He was ranked 59th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.  \n#### 2018  \nOn March 11, 2018, the Los Angeles Chargers signed Hayward to a three-year, $33.25 million contract extension that includes $20 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $8 million. The contract is worth up to $36 million with incentives and keeps Hayward under contract through the 2021 season.  \n#### 2019  \nIn week 2 against the Detroit Lions, Hayward recorded his first interception of the season off Matthew Stafford in the 13–10 loss. He recorded his second interception off Mitchell Trubisky in a week 8 17–16 win over Chicago Bears.  \n#### 2020  \nIn Week 1 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Hayward recorded a team high 12 tackles (12 solo) and two pass deflections during the 16–13 win. He was named the AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 1. In Week 16 against the Denver Broncos, Hayward recorded his first interception of the season off a pass thrown by Drew Lock before exiting the game with a hamstring injury. Without Hayward, the Chargers won the game 19–16.  \nOn January 1, 2021, Hayward was placed on injured reserve. He finished the season with 41 tackles, eight passes defensed and one interception.  \nOn March 13, 2021, Hayward was released by the Chargers.  \n### Las Vegas Raiders  \n<image>Hayward (left) playing against the Washington Football Team in 2021.\nHayward signed with the Las Vegas Raiders on May 4, 2021.\n\n### Atlanta Falcons  \nOn March 17, 2022, Hayward signed a two-year, $11 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons. He was placed on injured reserve on October 18, 2022, after suffering a shoulder injury in Week 6.  \nOn April 21, 2023, Hayward was released with a failed physical designation.  \n## NFL career statistics  \n### Regular season  \n### Postseason  \n## Personal life  \nHayward was raised in Perry, Georgia, by his parents Casey and Tish Hayward and began playing youth football when he was five years old. His mother Tish died from breast cancer in July 2016.  \nOn November 27, 2017, it was reported that Hayward's younger brother, Jecavesia Hayward, died after a Toyota Camry he was a passenger in crashed into a tractor trailer that was stopped in the emergency lane on Interstate 75. His brother was ejected from the vehicle and hit by passing vehicles. Hayward was allowed to leave the team's facilities and immediately traveled home to be with his family.  \n### Philanthropy  \nHayward is involved in many philanthropic endeavors and started his own charity aptly named the Hayward's Hands Foundation. Through the Hayward's Hands Foundation, Hayward donates scholarships to teenagers in his hometown that display hard work and dedication to school, athletics, and to their community. On May 5, 2015, he awarded two $5,000 scholarships to two female students that attend his high school alma mater. Hayward also announced his foundation will continue to award scholarships to students and agreed to pledge $50,000.\n\nQuestion: In which year did the football player shown in the images sign with the Las Vegas Raiders?\nChoice list: \nA. 2012\nB. 2015\nC. 2021\nD. 2023\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.",

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Nobody Knows Me  \n\"Nobody Knows Me\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna. The song was written and produced by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzaï for her ninth studio album American Life (2003). It was released as a promotional single in the United States on October 15, 2003, with a remixed version appearing on the remix compilation Remixed & Revisited (2003). \"Nobody Knows Me\" carries on the main theme of American Life, with its usage of negative tones on the songs. It is a dance and electronic song, with vocoder effects, spacey synths and a bubbly bass, and lyrically, Madonna rejects tabloid culture's \"social disease\", denouncing both TV and magazines.  \nThe song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, with many of whom calling it as a highlight from American Life. Four remixes were released in club stations around the United States, with one of them peaking at number four on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song, along with \"Nothing Fails\", topped the US Hot Dance Singles Sales chart and also charted on the ARIA Club Tracks in Australia. Madonna did a performance of the song alone on stage on her Re-Invention World Tour in 2004. It was also used as a video interlude on the MDNA Tour in 2012, showing Madonna's face morphed with a number of famous figures. French far-right politician Marine Le Pen sued Madonna for superimposing a swastika and Adolf Hitler's face with hers.  \n## Background  \nAmerican Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1, Madonna discussed her motivations behind the record discussing her 20 years in the industry and stating that \"material things\" were unimportant, stating \"I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that a lot of things that I'd valued weren't important\", in response to the non-materialistic themes of the record. The album has been deemed by some as a concept album featuring political themes based around the United States. \"The songs are examining things I valued and things I found myself worrying about, caring too much about, and realizing that those things aren't important and wanting to get out from underneath that cloud, the world of illusion\", Madonna stated. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, the main concept of American Life was about \"nothing\". This was evident in the titles of the songs like \"Nobody Knows Me\", usage of \"no\" in \"Love Profusion\", as well as \"Nothing Fails\". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. O'Brien described the concept of the album and the song:  \n\"If Like a Prayer was her divorce album, American Life is her psychoanalysis. She even name checks Sigmund Freud and throws out countless questions. Who am I? Where am I going? What does it all mean? Much of the album is suffused with sarcasm: right from the disaffected ennui of the title track to the stroppiness of 'Nobody Knows Me', Madonna is kicking against the claustrophobic effect of celebrity worship.\"  \nA remix of the song was featured in Madonna's 2003 compilation Remixed & Revisited. Other remixes by Peter Rauhofer, Mount Sims and Above & Beyond were serviced to dance clubs. In 2004, Madonna released a book entitled Nobody Knows Me which was available exclusively for one month only via Madonna's official website for $24 each. It included 52 pages of rare and unseen shots \"commented by an Icon and her angels\".  \n## Recording and composition  \n\"Nobody Knows Me\" was written and produced by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzaï. The recording sessions for American Life started at late 2001, then was put on hold as Madonna filmed Swept Away in Malta and starred in the West End play Up for Grabs. She returned to the Olympic Recording Studios in late 2002 and finished off the sessions. The mixing for the track was done by Mark \"Spike\" Stent at the Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, while Tim Young did the mastering of the song at Metropolis Studios in London. Ahmadzaï played the guitars, and also did the necessary programming. Two machines were used for the vocal editing in songs like \"Hollywood\" and \"Nobody Knows Me\". Madonna preferred the Antares Auto-Tune plug in, while Ahmadzaï chose an AMS pitch shifter. Madonna chose Auto-Tune because she wanted \"Nobody Knows Me\" to have a more dance-like feel to it, although Ahmadzaï was against it.  \n\"Nobody Knows Me\" has vocoder effects, spacey synths, bubbly bass. IGN Music's Spencer D. described that the song blips, glurgs, and shuffles with a Jetsons' styled disco ebb and flow and sounds like as an outtake from Music (2000). It begins with vocoder treated vocals over a bleeping synth, on a minor chord. Heavy drum hits stress the melody during the verse. \"Nobody Knows Me\" is written in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Madonna's voice spanning from B3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–Am–D–Am–A–E as its chord progression. Lyrically, she rejects tabloid culture's \"social disease\", denouncing both TV and magazines. The chorus features repeated echo shifts of \"nobody knows me\" while she ponders thoughts like, \"It's no good when you're misunderstood, but why should I care what the world thinks of me?\". O'Brien described it as a trancey track with a sense of childlike defiant lyrics, dismissing critics who have no knowledge of her \"jealously guarded inner self\".  \n## Critical reception  \n<image>Madonna performing \"Nobody Knows Me\" during the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic praised the song as one of the best tracks of the album, calling it \"infectious\". Sean O'Brien from The People praised \"Nobody Knows Me\" as \"the best song of the album\" and her \"one of her best ever\". He also said that the song is one of the reasons why Madonna is queen of pop. Jon Pareles from The New York Times considered it as the album's most danceable song. Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, called the song \"dazed-sounding\". Metro Times described Ahmadzai's programming as \"by far the best thing on the album\". James Hannaham from Spin compared \"Nobody Knows Me\" to Donna Summer's \"I Feel Love\", and deemed it as a highlight from the album. Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was \"insane\" with its electronic, chaotic, fast and manic pounding synths. \"There is so much going on here several it'll take several plays to really get it, but it's ace.\" Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly described \"Nobody Knows Me\" as the \"downright thrilling\" and \"deploys a shrewd little form-versus-content paradox\".  \nSpence D. from IGN Music commented that the song is the coolest song on the album up to this point. Paul Rees from Q magazine complemented the track as a \"conventional rock song, filled with drama, darkness and surprises\". USA Todays Edna Gunderson said that the \"funkified\" synth-pop of \"Nobody Knows Me\" attests to Madonna's \"undiminished\" skills as a shrewd pop composer. Yahoo! Music's Dan Genoe commented that Madonna has a personality crisis in the song. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice gave the song a mixed review, writing: \"It mutes slightly the slaphappy beats of Mirwais's own club hit \"Disco Science\" to make vague digs at the press and defensively vow self-improvement. Madonna's voice is mixed and diced into baby gurgles, which might have been cute if it weren't so redundant.\" John Payne from LA Weekly deduced that even within the synth sounds of the song, he could see \"real feeling deeply ingrained in this particular icon. 'Why should I care what the world thinks of me?' That is, yes, she does care what the world thinks of her. She says she’ll just withdraw from the public eye, ’cause who needs this, huh?\" Conversely, Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, gave a negative review saying that \"Nobody Knows Me\" might be the silliest track that Madonna had ever recorded.\n\n## Chart performance  \nThe song, along with \"Nothing Fails\", topped the Hot Dance Singles Sales while the Peter Rauhofer remix peaked at number four on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. According to Fred Bronson, the single release of the remixes of the song debuted at number-one on the Hot Singles Sales and Hot Dance Single Sales chart, on the issue dated December 27, 2003, the same week it also moved up to the top-twenty of the Dance Club Play chart. \"Me Against the Music\" by Britney Spears, on which Madonna was featured, and \"Nobody Knows Me\", both were also present in the top-twenty, making Madonna the only artist to have three songs within the top-twenty on the chart simultaneously. At the year-end Hot Dance Singles Sales recap, \"Nothing Fails / Nobody Knows Me\" was at number two position, while \"Me Against the Music\" and \"Love Profusion\" was at numbers one and three respectively. Billboard reported that Madonna was the first artist in its chart history to have the top three Dance Sales song. In Australia, the Peter Rauhofer/Above & Beyond Remix debuted at number 80 on the ARIA Club Tracks, peaking at number 49 the next week.  \n## Live performances  \n<image>Dancers practicing slacklining during the video interlude of \"Nobody Knows Me\", which morphed Madonna's face with a number of famous figures, on the MDNA Tour in 2012\nMadonna performed the song during the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, as the second song on the opening segment of the show. \"Nobody Knows Me\" was rehearsed with the Peter Rauhofer's Private Life remix. According to Dirk Timmerman, author of Madonna Live! Secret Re-inventions and Confessions on Tour, Madonna lip-synched the performance. During this section, the singer wore a jewel encrusted corset, created by designer Christian Lacroix. After the opening number, \"Vogue\", she started an energetic version of the song, on a conveyor belt with some laser light words appearing on the backdrop screens behind her. It also features a giant catwalk lowered from the ceiling. After this performance, she performed \"Frozen\" alone on stage. The performance of \"Nobody Knows Me\" was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary.  \nThe song was later added as a video interlude on the MDNA Tour in 2012, as a tribute to Tyler Clementi and other teens who had committed suicide due to bullying. The film, which was created by Swedish director Johan Söderberg, morphed Madonna's face with a number of famous figures, including then-Chinese President Hu Jintao, US Republican former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Pope Benedict XVI. The face of French far right politician Marine Le Pen appeared on the screen with a swastika superimposed on her forehead, before it morphed into the face of Adolf Hitler. Socialist French government spokesperson Najat Vallaud-Belkacem had also expressed her disappointment. However, Madonna kept the video unchanged on this date, prompting Le Pen to file a lawsuit against her. A spokesman for Le Pen said a lawsuit for \"public insult\" would be lodged with the Paris courts in the next few days. Madonna responded to the lawsuit saying \"I know that I made a certain Marine Le Pen very angry with me. And it's not my intention to make enemies.\" She later explained in an interview with Brazilian network Rede Globo, that the sequence was about \"intolerance that we human beings have for one another. And how much we judge people before knowing them. That's why it's done in the song 'Nobody Knows Me.'\" During her concert in Nice, France, the swastika was removed and was replaced by a question mark. The performance was included on Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.\n\n## Formats and track listings  \n* \"Nothing Fails\" – US CD maxi-single  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Peter Rauhofer's Classic House Mix) – 8:24  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Nevins Big Room Rock Mix) – 6:44  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Tracy Young's Underground Mix) – 7:29  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Nevins Global Dub) – 7:45  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Jackie's In Love In The Club Mix) – 7:28  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Peter Rauhofer's Private Life Part 1) – 8:07  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Above & Beyond 12\" Mix) – 8:45  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Mount Sims Italo Kiss Mix) – 5:26  \n* US promo vinyl single  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Peter Rauhofer's Private Life Mix Part 1) – 8:07  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Mount Sims Old School Mix) – 4:46  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Above & Beyond 12\" Mix) – 8:50  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Mount Sims Italo Kiss Mix) – 5:25  \n* Digital video single  \n-  \"Music\" (Live) – 2:31  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Live) – 3:36  \n## Credits and personnel  \n* Madonna – lead vocals, background vocals, songwriter, producer  \n* Mirwais Ahmadzaï – songwriter, producer, guitars, programming  \n* Tim Young – audio mastering  \n* Mark \"Spike\" Stent – audio mixing  \nCredits for \"Nobody Knows Me\" are adapted from American Life liner notes.  \n## Charts  \n### Weekly charts  \n### Year-end charts\n\nQuestion: Which tour featured Madonna performing \"Nobody Knows Me\" with a video interlude that included the morphing of her face with various famous figures?\nChoice list: \nA.

The nations are the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Vandals, Gepids, Saxons, Burgundians, Thuringians, Lombards, Bavarians, Romans, Bretons, Franks and Alamanni.  \nThe Table is called \"Frankish\" after the origin of the surviving manuscript tradition, not the origin of the work itself. In structure it is similar to the \"Table of Nations\" in the Bible. Although it survives in over ten manuscripts, the only medieval work to make use of it was the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, which nonetheless assured it a wide diffusion. The Table itself is the oldest extant work to make use of the Germania, a 1st-century work of Tacitus. It is also the oldest work to mention the Bavarians.  \nThe Table was probably composed in the Byzantine Empire, or possibly in the Ostrogothic Kingdom, around 520. It may have originally been written in Greek. Its author fit contemporary peoples, mostly Germanic, into a framework supplied by Tacitus. Later copyists frequently combined the text with lists of Roman and Frankish kings, which some modern editors have treated as integral parts of the text.  \n## Title  \nIn 1851, Karl Müllenhoff assigned the text the name by which it is now generally known—Frankish Table of Nations, or fränkische Völkertafel—because he thought it was written from the perspective of a Frank of about the year 520. Georg Heinrich Pertz, in the first published notice of the text from 1824, called it Populorum Germanorum generatio (\"generation of the peoples of the Germans\"). Müllenhoff himself, in his edition of Tacitus' Germania, included it in an appendix as the Generatio regum et gentium (\"generation of kings and peoples\"). Bruno Krusch calls the addition to manuscript D containing the Table De gentilium et barbarorum generationibus (\"on the generations of peoples and barbarians\"). David Dumville, in an appendix to his edition of the Historia Brittonum, calls it the Genealogiae Gentium (\"genealogies of nations\"). Walter Goffart in his edition based on all surviving manuscripts places it under the title Generatio Gentium (\"generation of peoples\").  \nIn three manuscripts the Table appears under a rubric (title). In manuscript A it is Incipit generatio regum (\"here begins the generation of kings\") and in B Item de regibus Romanorum (\"item on the kings of the Romans\"). In M, it is Hieronymus in cronicis (\"Jerome in chronicles\"). This mystifying rubric suggests that the copyist saw a connection between the Table and the Chronicon of Jerome or something in that tradition. A chronicle falsely attributed to Jerome is found in manuscript F.  \n## Origins  \n### Date  \nMüllenhoff dated the Table to around 520, while Krusch favoured the late 7th or early 8th century, since he believed that the list of Roman kings that accompanies the text in some manuscripts was an integral part of it and could not be earlier than the late Merovingian period. Modern scholarship accepts Müllenhoff's dating based on internal evidence. The Vandals and Gepids effectively ceased to exist after the conquest of their kingdoms in 534 and 567, respectively. The Thuringians and Burgundians were conquered by the Franks in 531 and 534, but are listed alongside the independent Lombards. The Lombards are an obscure people before their defeat of the Heruli in 510. The Bavarians likewise are not otherwise mentioned in any text before Jordanes' Getica in or shortly after 551. This suggests that the text was composed between 510 and 531. Krusch was correct, however, regarding the date of the Roman king list, which is a later addition.  \n### Place  \n<image>Manuscript E: the Table of Nations is on the short folio on the left. The first page of the Origo gentis Langobardorum is on the right.\nThe Frankish Table of Nations was composed either in Ostrogothic Italy or the Byzantine Empire. Goffart, its most recent editor, favours a Byzantine origin, as does Helmut Reimitz. Nicholas Evans favours an Italian origin.  \nThe main argument in favour of an Italian origin is the use of the Germania of Tacitus. No surviving work earlier than this one made use of it, and the only other author to make use of it before the 9th century was Cassiodorus in Ostrogothic Italy. This is proof for the circulation of the Germania in Italy in the early 6th century. It is not known with certainty to have ever been available in the Byzantine Empire, although it may be quoted in the 7th-century Strategikon of Maurice.  \nThe content of the text provides evidence of a Byzantine origin, and its purpose is readily related to the interest of the emperors Justin I and Justinian I in a restoration of Roman rule in the West in the 520s. It may even have been directly linked to the accession of either Justin in 518 or Justinian 527. For the time, a Byzantine origin is consistent with an original composition in either Latin or Greek.\n\n### Authorship  \nThe author of the Table is unknown. Although there have been many past attempts to determine his ethnicity or nationality from internal evidence, the Table does not obviously glorify or denigrate any people in particular. Müllenhoff argued for the Frankish identity of the author and gave the Table its conventional name. Many arguments for a Frankish author would apply equally well to a Gothic one. Ferdinand Lot suggested that he was an Alan cleric.  \nGoffart argues that if the author was writing in Ostrogothic Italy he was probably a Roman and not a Goth (despite the fact that he does place the Goths first among the nations). Evans suggests he was an Ostrogoth. If writing in the Byzantine Empire, he was most likely a resident of Constantinople, the seat of power. In favour of the Byzantine hypothesis, Goffart argues that the Table represents \"the ethnic panorama of the current West as seen from a metropolitan angle of vision\".  \n## Manuscripts  \n### Independent  \nSeparate recensions of the Table are found in seven manuscripts. Six of these were assigned the sigla ABCDEF in the 19th century and the seventh is designated M:  \nA. St Gall Stiftsbibliothek, 732 at folios 154–155.Written in Carolingian minuscule in the first third of the 9th century, not necessarily at the Abbey of Saint Gall. The codex also contains a copy of the Lex Alamannorum, a couple of religious tracts and several other chronological texts.  \nB. Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, lat. 4628A at folio 5.Written in Carolingian minuscule in the 10th century at the Abbey of Saint Denis. It is a legal codex, including the Lex Salica and a Frankish king list. Two copies of this manuscript were made in the 15th century, Vaticanus Ottobonianus 3081 and Paris lat. 4631.  \nC. Rome, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Vat. lat. 5001 at folio 140V.Written in Gothic script around 1300, probably at Salerno. It was copied from an exemplar in Beneventan script, possibly one made under the direction of Abbot Desiderius of Monte Cassino (1058–1086), as argued by Ludwig Bethmann, or perhaps earlier (c. 974), still in southern Italy. There are several copies of Vat. lat. 5001, including Vat. lat. 5000. The manuscript's other contents have a south Italian focus and are historical and legal in nature, including the Chronicon Salernitanum and the chronicle of Erchempert.  \nD. Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, lat. 609 at folio 28V.This small and well-used manuscript was written in Visigothic script in the early 9th century, but the Table was added in a different but non-French hand to a blank folio in the 10th or 11th century. The original content is computus, but the Table was added as part of some joca monachorum. This manuscript was once held by the Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges. Goffart provides an edition of the joca at the end of his edition of the Table.  \nE. La Cava, Archivio della Badia della Santissima Trinità, 4 (22) at folio 1.Written in Beneventan script around 1005, probably in Benevento. This is the Codex legum Langobardorum, a famous illustrated manuscript of the Origo gentis Langobardorum and Edictum Rothari in which the Table was inserted after completion before the first folio, although probably by the original compilers. The hand of the insert appears to match that of the last quire.  \nF. Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek, Reichenau CCXXIX (Codex Augiensis 229) at folio 184.Written in an Italian hand in the early 9th century. The manuscript seems to have been completed in Italy after 821, which date appears in it, and probably before 822, when it appears to have been catalogued in the library of the Abbey of Reichenau. It contains an apparent reference to the destruction of the town of Chieti in 801 and another town in 805 during the war between King Pippin of Italy and Prince Grimoald III of Benevento, which has been taken to indicate an origin in Abruzzo. Material in Carolingian minuscule was added later, probably at Reichenau. It contains computistic, chronological, theological and grammatical texts, including several works by Isidore of Seville, a chronicle falsely attributed to Jerome and a world map.  \nM. Monte Cassino, Archivio della Badia, 384 at folio 136.Written in Beneventan script in the early 10th century with some slightly later additions. It is part of a florilegium of otherwise classical and patristic writings and Alcuin. The letter M comes from the first letter in its version of the Table, which begins Mulius rex...  \nThe manuscripts can be grouped by origin, with ABCD originating north of the Alps and EMF originating in Italy. AB and EMF appear to derive from a common source. In their treatment of the Table of Nations, the manuscripts can be grouped in several other ways. ACDEF treat it as filler, unconnected to the rest of their contents, while only BM integrate it fully. It is found with historical texts in A, legal texts in BCE and sacred texts in DFM. The texts of the Table in E and M are identical, probably because M was the model for E. According to Walter Pohl, the manuscripts CEM are all the product of a strategy of identity-building at Monte Cassino.  \n### Historia Brittonum  \nThe Table as it appears in the Historia in Harley MS 3859 The red A begins Ab Hisitione autem orte sunt quattuor gentes..., \"From Istio were sprung four peoples...\"  \nThe Table was incorporated into the Historia Brittonum (written c. 830), where it is fully integrated into a series of genealogical texts. It follows the generations of Noah from Genesis, of which the Table itself may be an imitation, and is followed by a genealogy tracing the three brothers' descent from Adam. As in EMF, in the Historia Brittonum the main genealogy is connected to a single royal Roman progenitor.  \nThe version of the Table in the Historia is related to that in F and derives ultimately from an Italian version. The Table can be found in §§13–16 of the Harleian recension of the Historia, §7 of the Vatican recension, ch. 13 of the Sawley recension and §9 of the Chartres manuscript. In the manuscript Harley 3859 copied around 1100, which includes the Table, the Historia is interpolated by a 10th-century set of Welsh genealogies.  \nThe Historia is the only work prior to the 19th century to make actual use of the Table. A widely copied text, it ensured the Table a wide diffusion. There are three Gaelic versions of the Table derived from the Harleian Historia: in the Lebor Bretnach, a mid-11th-century translation of the Historia; in one recension of the late 11th-century historical compilation Lebor Gabála Érenn; and in the 11th-century Middle Irish Sex aetates mundi. In the 12th century, Lambert of Saint-Omer incorporated the text of the Table from a copy of the Historia into his encyclopaedic Liber Floridus. Another 12th-century writer, Geoffrey of Monmouth, was also influenced by the genealogical material in the Historia, including the Frankish Table.  \n## Transmission  \nThe Table was probably brought to the Frankish kingdom in the 6th or 7th century. If originally in Greek, it probably received its translation there. The Excerpta latina barbari is another originally Greek work that travelled west and survives only in a Latin translation made in the Merovingian kingdom. The reign of Theudebert I (533–548) and the later 6th century were both periods of intense Frankish–Byzantine diplomacy that may have resulted in the transmission of texts such as these.  \nAll surviving copies of the Table derive from a Frankish copy made probably in the late 7th or 8th century. No surviving manuscript pre-dates the Carolingian period and two of the manuscripts (AB) originated in the Carolingian empire. Both place the Table between a list of Roman rulers and a list of Frankish rulers. Outside of the Frankish kingdom, the text circulated in Italy.  \nTwo features common to all manuscripts are probably emendations by an early Frankish copyist: the introduction of the term Walagothi in place of an unknown original and the addition of the Saxons to the original list of twelve nations. The term Walagothi is a hapax legomenon, occurring nowhere else in literature. It consists of the prefix wala- (from proto-Germanic *walhaz), meaning foreign, and the name of the Goths. Such a construction implies the hand of a native Germanic speaker. The Saxons were far more prominent to an 8th-century Frank than a 6th-century Byzantine and they break the even division of twelve peoples into three groups. Nicholas Evans considers the hypothesis of later Frankish emendation unwarranted.  \nIn every manuscript, the Frankish Table of Nations appears attached to other texts. In AB, the Table follows a list of Roman kings and precedes a list of Frankish kings; in C, it is followed by a list of Frankish and Bavarian lawgivers; in D, it comes as the answer to the last of eight questions in a joca monachorum; and in EMF, the main genealogy is connected to a single royal Roman progenitor. This demonstrates that the core text once circulated independently without any Roman kings or any father to the three brothers. Goffart's edition covers the Table itself and the additions.  \n## Text  \n### Earliest attainable version  \nThe Table circulated as what Léopold Genicot called a \"living text\" (texte vivant), a text in which every copy becomes a new edition and not merely a witness to the original. It is thus impossible to produce an Urtext (original version) from surviving witnesses. Goffart provides what he calls the \"earliest attainable version\", essentially a composite of what is common to all witnesses.  \nTres fuerunt fratres, primus Erminus, secundus Inguo, tertius Istio. Inde adcreuerunt gentes XIII. Primus Erminus genuit Gothos, Walagothos, Wandalos, Gepedeos, et Saxones. Inguo genuit Burgundiones, Turingos, Langobardos, Baioarios. Istio genuit Romanes, Brittones, Francos, Alamannos.  \nThere were three brothers, first Erminus, second Inguo, third Istio. From them derive thirteen peoples. First Erminus brought forth the Goths, Foreign Goths, Vandals, Gepides and Saxons. Inguo brought forth the Burgundians, Thuringians, Lombards, Bavarians. Istio brought forth the Romans, British or Bretons, Franks, Alamans.  \n### Variations  \nThe spelling in the manuscripts is erratic and follows no rule. Inguo may be spelled Tingus or Nigueo; Istio becomes Scius or Hostius; the Gepids are sometimes Brigidos or Cybedi; the Thuringians are Loringus or Taringi; in one the Goths and Walagoths become Butes and Gualangutos.  \nIn manuscripts AB, the Table is preceded by a list of Roman kings that begins with a \"first king of the Romans\" (primus rex Romanorum) named Analeus (A) or Allanius (B). In F, Alaneus is the father of the three brothers, while in the Historia Alanus is the father and also the \"first man who came to Europe\" (primus homo uenit ad Europam) of the nation of Japheth, son of Noah. In EM, the father of the brothers is called King Mulius.  \nThe Table contains what is probably the earliest reference to the Bavarians. The next reference to them is in the Getica from about 551. The spelling in the manuscripts can provide no evidence for the early spelling or pronunciation of the Bavarians' name. The spellings given are Baioarius (A), Baweros (B), Baioeros (C), Bawarios (D), Baioarios (EMF) and Boguarii or Bogari (in the Historia). Thomas Hodgkin took the Boguarii to be the Bulgarians.  \nManuscript F departs most radically from the standard text. It changes the order of the brothers, placing Istio before Erminus and Inguo. The nations descended from Istio are the same, but Erminus' Vandals and Saxons are swapped with Inguo's Burgundians and Lombards. The same changes are found in the Historia. The other Italian versions, E and M, contain less drastic changes. The number of peoples is reduced to twelve by the elimination of the Vandals and the Thuringians are replaced by Tuscans to create a \"more emphatically modernized catalogue of peoples\".  \nSome copies of the Historia also change the Romans into Latins (Latini) and the Alamanni into Albani. The latter may be explained as the work of a Welsh copyist for whom m and b were interchangeable, but more probably reflects another modernization or updating of the Table to better reflect the reality known to a scribe working in northern Wales between 857 and 912, who would have been more familiar with the land and people of Alba (Scotland), a kingdom just forming at that time, than Alemannia. Patrich Wadden sets out tables displaying all the variations in the different recensions of the Historia and its Gaelic descendants.  \n## Analysis  \nThe names of the three brothers are derived from the Germania of Tacitus. According to Tacitus, \"the author of the Germanic race\" was named Mannus and he had three sons who gave their names to the three major divisions of the Germani: the \"people nearest Ocean\" were called Ingaevones, \"those of the centre\" Herminones and \"the remainder\" Istvaeones. Mannus is not mentioned in the Table and the names given to the brothers are not found in Tacitus but are derived from the names he gives to the peoples. Müllenhoff once mooted that the Table was the work of a West Germanic compiler familiar with the same folk history—still thus a living tradition in the 6th century—which had informed Tacitus' account several hundred years earlier. He later abandoned this position and the Table is not now thought to have originated in such a milieu.  \n<image>Thomas Hodgkin's presentation in tabular form of the Historia Brittonums version of the Frankish Table of Nations.\nThe thirteen nations selected for inclusion in the Table are contemporary with the author. The selection is not derived from Tacitus nor does it include any anachronistic names. If it is an attempt to list the Germanic peoples, then the author conceives of the Romans and Bretons as Germans. Possibly the author considered Germani to be synonymous with Westerners or Europeans, although the Vandals lived in Africa at the time.  \nThe first two nations named—the Goths without any qualifier and the Walagoths, that is, foreign Goths—represent the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths. Most likely, the Ostrogoths are the first and the Visigoths the second. It is probable that a Germanic-speaking editor in the Frankish kingdom replaced the by then rare term Visigoths with a Germanic gloss. \"Foreign\" in this case means \"Romance-speaking\" and refers to the \"romanized\" Visigoths of Spain and southern Gaul. Herwig Wolfram glosses the term as \"Roman Goths\" and Wadden as \"Welsh Goths\".  \nThe assignment of the contemporary nations to Tacitean categories was made on the basis of Tacitus' descriptions. The author of the Table took \"those of the centre\" to mean the most prominent and assigned the most prominent nations of his time to the first group, the Herminones. These, minus the Saxons, form a quartet common in Byzantine literature. Procopius in On the Wars defines the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths and Gepids as the \"Gothic nations\" that \"all came originally from one tribe\". The same quartet is also found in Cyril of Scythopolis' Life of Sabbas, written about 556. They were all Arian Christians and major enemies of the Byzantine Empire in the early 6th century. Besides the Table, Theophanes the Confessor (c. 800), Landolfus Sagax (c. 1000) and Nikephoros Kallistos (c. 1320) all preserve this quartet of nations from early Byzantine historiography. The Saxons are thought to be a later addition to the Table by a Frankish editor.  \nThe second group, the Ingaevones, are those nearest the ocean, taken to be the nations north of Italy and east of Gaul. The remainder were the westernmost nations, a miscellany of Germanic and non-Germanic peoples that make up the third group. They represent the peoples of the Frankish kingdoms. It is possibly significant that the Table was composed shortly after the death of Clovis I (511), founder of the Merovingian Frankish kingdom when its continued cohesion was in question and its component peoples may have appeared more independent.  \nThe use of the Table in the Carolingian Empire can be read as part of an effort to integrate Roman and Frankish history. There is a parallel between the placement of the Franks, Britons and Romans as brothers in the Table and the claims of each of those people to Trojan ancestry: the Romans through Aeneas, the Merovingians through Francus and the Britons through Brutus (Britto). The only copy of the Table that connects it directly with the Trojan claims, however, is that found in the Historia, which is also the only one that connects it with the generations of Noah.  \nThe introduction of the Tuscans in place of the Thuringians first occurs in manuscript M from the early 10th century and was followed in E, written around 1005. The change has been linked to the creation of a distinct regional Tuscan identity after the fall of the Lombard Kingdom in 774. The copyist of E, who probably had both versions to choose from, chose the Tuscan version because enhanced contacts between the Lombard south of Italy and Tuscany in his day. Willa and Gemma, the daughters of Prince Landulf IV of Benevento and Capua (982), married prominent members of the Tuscan families Aldobrandeschi and Cadolingi. E also includes the Capua Chronicle, which gives a starring role to Marquis Hugh of Tuscany for his intervention in Capua in 993 following the murder of Prince Landenulf II.  \nAll versions of the Historia Brittonum interpose between the brothers and the nations invented names for the founding fathers of the nations, mimicking the decision of the original author of the Table to create names for the brothers based on the names of their peoples. The intervening layer reads:  \nHessitio autem habuit filios quattuor: hi sunt Francus, Romanus, Britto, Albanus. Armenon autem habuit quinque filios: Gothus, Valagothus, Gebidus, Burgundus, Longobardus. Negue autem habuit tres filios: Wandalus, Saxo, Boguarus.  \nHessitio had four sons, Francus, Romanus, Britto and Albanus; Armenon had five sons, Gothus, Walagothus, Gepidus, Burgundus, Langobardus; Negue had three sons, Vandalus, Saxo, Bavarus.  \nSome versions have Alemannus instead of Albanus. The Gaelic versions of the Table derived from the Historia drop the nations entirely, retaining only the brothers and their sons. They also have Albanus. Scholars are divided on the intended referent of the Albani, the descendants of Albanus. A connection with the \"Scythian\" Albani of Asia, mentioned in the 7th-century Etymologies of Isidore, is possible but unlikely. A Scythian origin for the Picts of northern Britain was proposed by Bede in the 8th century, probably based on Isidore, and became the centerpiece of the 12th-century Cronica de origine antiquorum Pictorum. Chronological considerations also exclude reference to the Balkan Albanians. Dumville argues that the Italian city of Alba Longa, whose inhabitants are called Albani elsewhere in the Historia, is meant. This city had an important role in the legend of Rome's founding. Evans considers it most likely that the Albani are the people of Alba (Scotland) and that a Welsh scribe updated the Table in the same way that a contemporary Italian scribe did: by replacing a more distant and less relevant people with one closer to home. It is less likely that the Albani are the inhabitants of Albion (Britain), since in that case they would be redundant to the Britti. The Gaelic version of the Lebor Gabála Érenn, however, specifies that Albanus' brother founded Alba Letha (\"Albania on the Continent\") and its author probably had in mind either Scythian Albania or Alba Longa. Edward Cowan translates it \"Albanians of Latium in Italy\". The Sex aetates mundi is even clearer: the Albani are from \"the eastern Albania in great Asia\" (ind Albain airtherach isind Asia móir).\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts and images, which of the following statements is true regarding the Frankish Table of Nations and its origins?\nChoice list: \nA.

Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.\nSeveral explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word Malkin.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.\n\n## Toponymy  \nThe name Malkin has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;ps=none the similar mawkin was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.ps=none Malkin was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in grimalkin or grey malkin,ps=none and was an old northern English name for a hare,ps=none into which witches were said to be able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,ps=none which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.ps=none Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln,ps=none which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.ps=none  \nAuthors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raidersps=none or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,ps=none but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.ps=none Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,ps=none and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.ps=none It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.ps=none  \nMalkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,ps=none or Mocking Tower.ps=none  \n## Association with witches  \nOn Good Friday, 10 April 1612,ps=none Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.ps=none The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device,ps=none two of the alleged Pendle witches.  \nOn 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.ps=none She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.ps=none Both were arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.ps=none  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's \"mentally sub-normal\" brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.ps=none Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York.ps=none  \n## Location  \nThe location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.ps=none It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials. The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the \"melancholy associations\" of the place.ps=none The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former royal forest that covered a considerable area south and east of Pendle Hill, extending almost to the towns of Burnley, Colne and Padiham.  \n<image>alt=Prominent structure on a hill\nOne contender is in the civil parish of Blacko, on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;ps=none since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.ps=none In The Lancashire Witch-Craze, Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and Gisburn.ps=none Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn public house; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.ps=none The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.ps=none It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the manor of Colne as Mawkin Yarde, described as being \"in the north of Colne\",ps=none but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.ps=none  \nIn 1891 local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.ps=none Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.ps=none  \nAnother possible location is somewhere near the village of Newchurch in Pendle.ps=none Douglas claims there is \"persuasive\" evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, Barley and Roughlee.ps=none Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.ps=none  \nArchaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.ps=none A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to Lower Black Moss reservoir near Barley.\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided, which statement is true regarding Malkin Tower?\nChoice list: \nA.

This style was almost definitively abandoned under the Flavian dynasty. It is not fully known what the catalyst for this change was.  \nTwo major trends emerged in sculpture: the use of a more nuanced chiaroscuro in the bas-relief, and the use of placing the figures in a three-dimensional space with regards to the perspective of the viewer.\n\n## Arch of Titus  \nRelief of the procession on the Arch of Titus  \nThe greatest symbol of the Flavian era is the Arch of Titus, dated between 81 and 90. The architecture is denser and heavier than the arches of the Augustan era, such as the Arch of Susa. This is a clear deviation from the traditional Hellenistic influence. Here for the first time in Rome the Ionic/Corinthian Composite order appears, a more ornamental style. The numerous internal reliefs of the archway are extraordinarily significant and show two moments of the triumphal procession which took place in 71 after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus.date=August 2020  \nIn these pieces, we see the innovation of Roman relief. Evident are the thickened figures, with the height of the figures consistent with their location in space. Individual figures are represented as if they were moving within three dimensions. Furthermore, the figures do not move on a straight line, but on a convex curved line, clearly visible in the relief of the procession. On the left it appears the figures are moving towards the viewer, and on the far right, moving away as they enter under the Porta Triumphalis. This trend continued to be developed further during the Nerva–Antonine dynasty.  \n## Other sculptures  \nThis era saw the commission of the Cancelleria Reliefs likely by Domitian, constructed around 90. These are imbued with classicism found in the era of Claudius, but also display the arrangement of the figures along a convex line.  \n## Architecture  \n<image>The Colosseum, constructed between 70 and 80\nThe Great Fire of Rome in 64 destroyed much of the city, making it necessary to rebuild. New squares were opened, the streets became wider and lined with arcades, and houses were constructed to a more limited height. Domitian rebuilt the burnt monuments at the Campus Martius, plus the Piazza Navona and the Odeon of Domitian.  \nThe Flavian dynasty, in particular under Domitian, oversaw the monumentalization of the Palatine Hill. The emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero all had residences on the hill, but the most grandiose palace was built by Domitian. The Palace of Domitian, constructed by the architect Rabirius, had at least three parts; the Domus Flavia, the Domus Augustana, and the gardens.  \nArchitectural development in the Flavian era was of fundamental importance for the implementation of new techniques. This period saw an increase in the use of the hemispherical domes (Domus Transitoria, the nymphaeum at the Villa of Domitian), the development of rib vaults (the Colosseum), the use of ogives with brick arches in series, and the development of barrel vaults, which reach 33 meters in diameter in the Domitian vestibule of the Roman Forum.\n\n\nQuestion: Which architectural innovation is commonly associated with the Flavian dynasty and can be seen in the design of the Colosseum?\nChoice list: \nA. The extensive use of the Doric order\nB. The development of rib vaults\nC. The introduction of Gothic arches\nD.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Mutilated victory  \nMutilated victory (vittoria mutilata) is a term coined by Gabriele D’Annunzio at the end of World War I, used to describe dissatisfaction concerning territorial rewards in favor of the Kingdom of Italy after the conflict.  \nAs a condition for entering the war against Austria-Hungary and Germany, Italy was promised in the Treaty of London signed in 1915 with the powers of the Triple Entente, recognition of control over Italian Tyrol, the Austrian Littoral, northern Dalmatia—territories with sizeable ethnic Italian population which had not become part of the Kingdom upon Italian unification in the late 19th century. Additionally, Italy was assured ownership of the Dodecanese, protection over Albania, and a sphere of influence around the Turkish city of Antalya, alongside a possible enlargement of her colonial presence in Africa.  \nAt the end of the war, despite the initial intention of the United Kingdom and France to remain faithful to the pact, objections by the United States, eventually supported by the British and the French, and in particular conflict over the concept of self-determination spelled out by President Wilson in his Fourteen Points, led to the partial disapplication of the agreement and to the retraction of substantial promises recognized at the onset of the conflict. Italy gained Italian Tyrol,  the Austrian Littoral, and some colonial compensations, but was not awarded the city of Fiume, League of Nations mandates, and northern Dalmatia with the exception of the city of Zara.  \nTogether with the economical cost of mobilization and the social turmoil ensuing from the end of the war, the infringement of the treaty is generally believed to have fueled the consolidation of Italian irredentism and Italian nationalism, and became a focal point in the propaganda, among others, of the National Fascist Party, which sought to expand the borders of the Italian state.  \n## Description  \n<image>Austrian linguistic map from 1896. In green the areas where Slavs were the majority of the population, in orange the areas where Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians were the majority of the population. The boundaries of Venetian Dalmatia in 1797 are delimited with blue dots.\nItaly joined World War I in 1915 on the side of the Allies, after negotiating the secret Treaty of London with the Triple Entente (Britain, France, and Russia). According to the secret pacts of London, the following territories were promised to Italy in case of victory: Trentino and South Tyrol, the Austrian Littoral (Trieste, Gorizia and Gradisca, and Istria), territories in Dalmatia, a protectorate over Albania with direct control of Vlora, and compensations in case of a colonial partition of the Central Powers' empires. The content of the pact of London was made public in 1917 by the Russians, following their withdrawal from the War after the communist revolution, in order to criticize the \"old diplomacy\" of the capitalist European powers. While France and Britain remained bound by the treaty of London, the US president Woodrow Wilson (who joined the Allies in 1917) opposed it and presented on January 8, 1918 fourteen points to redraw the map of Europe on the basis of nationality and ethnicity. During the decisive Italian offensive, the nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio coined the term mutilated victory by publishing an article in the Corriere della Sera dated October 24, 1918 and titled \"Our victory will not be mutilated\".  \nItaly's prime minister Vittorio Orlando, one of the Big Four of World War I, and his foreign minister Sidney Sonnino, an Anglican of British origins, arrived at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 in order to secure most of the London pacts. Considerable results were achieved with the treaties and agreements signed in 1919 and 1920. Most importantly, Trent-South Tyrol and the Austrian Littoral (Trieste, Gorizia and Gradisca, and Istria) became part of the Italian regions of Trentino-Alto Adige and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The colonial compensations obtained by Italy were: the recognition and enlargement of the Italian Islands of the Aegean; the enlargement of the Italian possessions in Libya and in the Horn of Africa; and the establishment of an Italian sphere of influence over the Ottoman area of Antalya, later abandoned with the independence of Turkey. Italy also received the province of Zadar with some islands in Dalmatia and set up an Italian protectorate over Albania with the occupation of Vlora, which lasted until 1920 when domestic opposition within the Italian Armed Forces and the Vlora war led Italy to voluntarily abandon Albania; with the treaty of Tirana, Italy retained the island of Saseno and recognition of Albania as being within its sphere of influence (which was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1921). Finally, the disintegration of its two main rival powers (Austria-Hungary in Europe and the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean) and the entrance in the League of Nations' security council as a permanent member, cemented Italy's status as a great power.  \nChanges to the Italian eastern border from 1920 to 1975.  \nTherefore, most of the criticism directed against the Allies and the government focused on Dalmatia and the city of Fiume (which was later occupied by a contingent led by Gabriele D'Annunzio). A more substantial transfer of Dalmatian territories to Italy (favored by Sonnino) was complicated to achieve because of its Slavic population, whereas Fiume was ethnically an Italian city (and as such proposed by Orlando as an alternative), but not included in the Pact of London. Wilson vetoed these proposals on the ground that already many Germanophones and Slavs were to be placed under Italian administration. This led Orlando and Sonnino to temporarily abandon the conference in protest. Orlando had refused to see the outcome of the war as a mutilated victory and once replied to calls for greater expansion that \"Italy today is a great state... on par with the great historic and contemporary states. This is, for me, our main and principal expansion.\" But the disgruntled climate ultimately forced Orlando to resign, and the treaties he had negotiated were signed by his successors Francesco Saverio Nitti and Giovanni Giolitti.  \nFrom a contemporary historical point of view, it has sometimes been observed how much of Benito Mussolini's foreign policy was presented as an attempt to amend the injustices lamented as stemming from the mutilated victory: Fiume was taken in 1924, Albania was turned into a client state under Zog I and merged into the Kingdom in 1939, and Dalmatia was annexed during the occupation of Yugoslavia—events that have been sporadically accused of prolonging Italy's participation in World War II. Some historians have at times seen the actions carried by the Fascist government on the subject as part of a larger imperialist project that brought Italy to descend into foreign affairs, by intervening in Spain, conquering Ethiopia, and occupying southern France and Tunisia. For historian Gaetano Salvemini “Fascism originated, grew, triumphed, and ultimately died, on the myth of mutilated victory”. Conversely, attempts to include in the Italian nation state the detached lands populated by Italophones have also been lauded and supported, with subjects failing to recognize said urgency being decried by poet Gabriele D’Annunzio as “insane and vile”.  \nNotwithstanding the political characterizations of the Interwar period, the final settlement of peace after the end of World War II, which had deprived Italy of all of the lands to the east of the Adriatic Sea (except for the city of Trieste), proved to be unpopular among the Italian opinion and object of harsh criticism, being described by President Luigi Einaudi as leading to a condition of “painfully mutilated” national unity.\n\n## Italy and the Triple Alliance  \nAngered by the French seizure of Tunisia, in which Italy had extensive economic interests and had viewed as a possible area for colonial annexation, in 1882, Italy joined the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria as a means of defending against further French aggression and gaining diplomatic backing for coming disputes. The alliance, however, proved troublesome. Italy and Austria-Hungary had been rivals for many years; the latter had, for years, held northeastern Italy, opposed Italian unification, and it still held Trieste and Istria, Zara and the coast of Dalmatia, the primary targets of the Italian irredentist movement.  \nAs such, in the years before 1914, Italy engaged in diplomatic maneuvers to ally itself with the United Kingdom and France. In 1902, Italy concluded a secret treaty with Britain in which Italy abandoned the Triple Alliance, with the stipulation that it be given the territories currently controlled by Austria.  \n## Treaty of London (1915)  \nAfter World War I erupted, the pressure by both sides for Italy to enter the war increased. On April 26, 1915, the Triple Entente and Italy signed a secret agreement, called the Treaty of London, that stipulated the terms of Italy’s participation in World War I against the Germany-Austrian Alliance. If Italy declared war on Germany and the Entente emerged victorious, Italy would be awarded territories of the House of Habsburg in the Southern Alps and in the Balkans, specifically the regions of Trentino and the South Tyrol (up to the northern limit of the Brenner Pass), the Friuli-Julian area, Trieste and the surrounding area, Istria, and the North of the Dalmatian Cost including the city of Šibenik. Other possible territories included in the treaty were the city of Vlorë in Albania, some part on the south Anatolian coast, as well as a share of the German colonial empire.  \n<image>Map of Dalmatia and Venezia Giulia with the boundaries set by the Treaty of London (1915) (red line) and those actually obtained from Italy (green line). The black line marks the border of the Governorate of Dalmatia (1941–1943). The ancient domains of the Republic of Venice are indicated in fuchsia (dashed diagonally, the territories that belonged occasionally)\nThese demands were outlined by the Italian Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino to secure a strong Italian presence in the Mediterranean. The acquisition of the area surrounding the Adriatic, especially the port city of Trieste, would strengthen Italian naval presence and keep pace with possible postwar territorial gains in the area by the other members of the Entente. The demands for lands carved from the Ottoman Empire and the African colonies were motivated by national ambition.  \nSonnino however delayed a declaration of war against Germany even though Italy had declared war on Austria-Hungary. By May 1915, the Italian push towards Ljubljana reached a stalemate with Austrian forces in the Alps while Britain, France and Germany were embroiled in a stalemate of their own on the Western Front. The outcome of the war was not yet clear, and Sonnino stood by a position of neutrality with Germany. That would soften as Sonnino realized Italy’s army was in no position to carry out a protracted war, and pressure from within Italy demanded solidarity with the Entente. The Italian government declared war on Germany on 28 August 1916.\n\n### Wilson's opposition  \nIn January 1917, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour wrote a letter to American President Woodrow Wilson expressing his disapproval of the promise to give Italy the Adriatic territories. In a later trip to the United States in May to speak with American diplomat Edward M. House about the pact, Balfour made it clear that Britain had no particular ill will against Austria-Hungary and that the planned transfer of the Slavic lands to Italy would only create more problems. While American-Italian diplomatic dialogue regarding the claims did not take place prior to the Peace Conference, Wilson’s own stance on the matter was clear in his Fourteen Points, which urged for the Italian border with Austria to be redrawn along \"clearly recognizable lines of nationality\". His first point urged for no international agreements to be negotiated in secret so he refused to recognise the arrangements made under the pact. Sonnino's plans for securing the Adriatic were ignored, as were the imperial aims of Italy, and concessions were made in the form of postwar American economic aid.  \n## Aftermath  \nThe cause of mutilated victory was embraced by many Italians, particularly in the irredentist, monarchical, militaristic factions. The poet Gabriele D'Annunzio criticized in print and in speeches the failures of Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando at the proceedings in Versailles, particularly in his attempts to acquire the city of Fiume (Croatian: Rijeka), which, notwithstanding the fact that its inhabitants were more than 90% ethnic Italians, was supposed to be ceded by Austria to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. On September 12, 1919, D’Annunzio took matters into his own hands and led a militia of 2,600 men against a mixed force of Allied soldiers to occupy the city. In Fiume, the victors established the Italian Regency of Carnaro, an unrecognized state based on the Charter of Carnaro.  \nWhile the regime would be short-lived, its effect on the people and politics of the Kingdom of Italy would leave their mark on the following decades of Italian history. Benito Mussolini was resolute to endorse the safeguard of national unity during the period of the creation of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento, the precursor of the National Fascist Party. Mussolini, an interventionist in World War I, attributed Italy’s great price of over 1.2 million casualties and 148 billion lire of expenditure to the weakness of the national government and to the disloyal attitude of the country’s former allies.\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided and the historical maps, which statement accurately describes Italy's territorial gains after World War I?\nChoice list: \nA. Italy obtained all the territories promised by the Treaty of London, including extensive areas in Dalmatia.\nB. Italy acquired Trentino-Alto Adige and the Austrian Littoral, but did not secure a large portion of Dalmatia as promised.\nC.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse  \nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a 2023 American animated superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Miles Morales / Spider-Man, produced by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation in association with Marvel Entertainment, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), it is set in a shared multiverse of alternate universes called the Spider-Verse. The film is directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson (in Dos Santos and Thompson's feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller who both also produce, and David Callaham. Shameik Moore voices Miles, starring alongside Hailee Steinfeld, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Vélez, Jake Johnson, Jason Schwartzman, Issa Rae, Karan Soni, Shea Whigham, Greta Lee, Daniel Kaluuya, Mahershala Ali and Oscar Isaac. In the film, Miles goes on an adventure with Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman across the multiverse where he meets a team of Spider-People known as the Spider-Society, led by Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099, but comes into conflict with them over handling a new threat in the form of the Spot.  \nSony began developing a sequel to Into the Spider-Verse prior to its 2018 release, with the writing and directing team attached. It was set to focus on the relationship between Moore's Miles and Steinfeld's Gwen. The sequel was officially announced in November 2019 and animation work began in June 2020, with a different visual style for each of the six universes visited by the characters.  \nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles, California on May 30, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 2, having been delayed from an original April 2022 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first film from Sony Pictures Animation to be released in theaters worldwide since The Angry Birds Movie 2 in August 2019. Like its predecessor, the film received critical acclaim for its stylized animation, visual style, story, action sequences, voice acting, score, and writing. It set several box office records, and was also a box office success, grossing $690 million against a production budget of $100million at the worldwide box office, surpassing its predecessor and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of the year domestically in the United States, the highest-grossing film produced by Sony Pictures Animation, and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2023. The third installment in the trilogy, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, and a female-focused spin-off film, Spider-Woman, are both in development.  \n## Plot  \nOn Earth-65, police captain George Stacy is unaware that his daughter Gwen Stacy is Spider-Woman. Years prior, Gwen accidentally caused the death of her best friend Peter Parker while he was rampaging as the Lizard, and police have been hunting her ever since. One night, Gwen encounters a version of the Vulture from an Italian Renaissance-themed alternate universe. Miguel O'Hara and Jess Drew arrive using portal-generating watches and help Gwen neutralize the Vulture. George corners Gwen, who then reveals her identity to him; distraught, he attempts to arrest her. Miguel reluctantly grants Gwen membership into the Spider-Society, allowing her to escape with him and Jess.  \nIn Brooklyn on Earth-1610, sixteen months after the Alchemax collider's destruction,efn|name=spider-verse-2018|As depicted in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) Miles Morales encounters the Spot, an Alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during the collider explosion. The Spot blames Miles for causing his condition and reveals that, while testing the collider, he had transported a spider from another dimension, Earth-42, which bit Miles and turned him into Spider-Man. The Spot then accidentally transports himself into a void, where he travels to other universes containing Alchemax colliders to empower himself further.  \nGwen travels to Earth-1610 and reconnects with Miles while secretly tracking the Spot. Miles secretly follows her through a portal to Earth-50101, and they team up with local Spider-Man Pavitr Prabhakar, and later Hobie Brown, against the Spot, who absorbs the power of that world's collider. The Spot and Miles share a vision of the Spot's future attacks that include the deaths of Police Inspector Singh (the father of Pavitr's girlfriend) and Miles' father Jeff. As the collider collapses, Miles saves Singh, but Earth-50101 begins falling apart from its disrupted \"canon event\" before members of the Spider-Society arrive to contain the damage. Miles, Gwen, and Hobie are sent to the Society's headquarters on Earth-928, where hundreds of Spider-People reside in a massive complex.  \nMiles, Gwen, and Hobie meet with Miguel and reunite with Peter B. Parker and his infant daughter Mayday. Miguel explains to Miles that each of the Spider-People's stories throughout the multiverse entails \"canon events\", such as the deaths of a police captain close to Spider-Man and an uncle figure to Spider-Man, as well as other string of events that define a Spider-Man; and straying from these events threatens reality and may cause that universe to collapse, which in turn will collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence. Miguel reveals he witnessed the collapse of another universe firsthand when attempting to replace a deceased version of himself from that universe.  \nMiles realizes that the Spot murdering Jeff, who is set to be promoted to police captain in two days, is a canon event. Miguel imprisons Miles to prevent him from saving Jeff, but Hobie helps Miles break loose before quitting the Society. As Miles flees through the complex, Miguel orders the Society to capture him. Miguel corners Miles and tells him that he is the original anomaly; the spider that bit him came from Earth-42, resulting in Earth-42 having no Spider-Man, and that if the spider had not bitten Miles, Earth-1610's Peter Parker would have stopped the collider and survived, and the Spot would never have existed.  \nMiles overpowers Miguel and flees to what he believes to be his home dimension. Considering Gwen a liability, a furious Miguel ejects her from the Society and forcibly sends her back to Earth-65. Once there, Gwen learns that George has resigned from his job as police captain. The two reconcile, and George gives Gwen a portal watch left by Hobie.  \nTo his shock, Miles realizes that he is on Earth-42, the home of the spider that bit him, rather than his own dimension. In this world, his uncle Aaron Davis is alive while his father Jeff is dead, and because Spider-Man does not exist, New York City is riddled with unchecked crime. As the Society searches for Miles, Gwen travels to Earth-1610 and speaks with Miles' parents, promising to find him and bring him home. Earth-42's Aaron restrains Miles, and it is revealed that Earth-42's Miles has become the Prowler.  \nAs the Spot begins his multiversal attack, Gwen assembles a team to find Miles, consisting of Peter B., Mayday, Pavitr, Hobie, Margo Kess, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham, while Miles prepares to escape.  \n## Voice cast  \nAn early poster for the film displaying numerous Spider-People appearing in the film.

The sequel was to continue the story of Miles Morales / Spider-Man, working from \"seeds that were planted\" throughout the first film. Joaquim Dos Santos and David Callaham were set to direct and write, respectively, with Amy Pascal returning from the first film as producer. The other producers of the first film—Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Avi Arad, and Christina Steinberg—were all also expected to return in some capacities. The next month, Pascal revealed that the film would focus on Miles and Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman, exploring a romance between the characters that was cut from the first film, and that the sequel would be a \"launching pad\" for a previously announced female-focused spin-off film featuring Gwen. Sony officially confirmed the sequel in November 2019, with a release date of April 8, 2022, with Lord and Miller returning as producers. In April 2020, Sony shifted the film's release to October 7, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nIn February 2021, Miller said that he and Lord were working on the film's screenplay with Callaham, and that Peter Ramsey would be an executive producer on the sequel after co-directing the first film. That April, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson were announced as co-directors alongside Dos Santos, and that all three had worked on the project since it began. (Thompson was production designer on the first film.) Arad and Steinberg were confirmed to return as producers with Lord, Miller and Pascal, with Alonzo Ruvalcaba co-producing and Aditya Sood, Into the Spider-Verse directors Bob Persichetti and Rodney Rothman, and Rebecca Karch and Brian Michael Bendis joining Ramsey as executive producers.  \nIn December, Lord and Miller revealed that the film was being split into two parts: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) and (Part Two), because they had written the story they wanted to tell for the sequel and realized it was too much for one film. Work on both parts was taking place simultaneously. The sequels were renamed in April 2022, becoming Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. Their release dates were shifted then, with Across the Spider-Verse pushed back to June 2, 2023. Lord and Miller said that they had told Sony the sequel would be the same size as Into the Spider-Verse, but it ended up having the largest crew of any animated film ever, with around 1,000 people working on it. They added that the film had 240 characters and would take place across six universes.\n\n### Casting  \nLord and Miller also expressed interest in including Spider-Punk, Takuya Yamashiro, the \"Japanese Spider-Man\" from the 1978 Spider-Man series, and Italian Spiderman in the following movies. In November 2019, Lord indicated that the character Takuya Yamashiro was designed, though he didn't make an appearance in the movie. In August 2020, Jake Johnson expressed hope that he could reprise his role as Peter B. Parker from the first film in the sequel. Issa Rae was cast as Jess Drew / Spider-Woman in June 2021, Johnson confirmed that he would be returning for the sequel a month later, and Oscar Isaac was confirmed in December to be reprising his role of Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 from the post-credits scene of Into the Spider-Verse. Also in December, Tom Holland—who plays Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe—revealed that Pascal had approached him about appearing in the Spider-Verse films during the filming of Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). Holland and his co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon all expressed interest in appearing in the upcoming films. Jeff Sneider of The Ankler claimed in February 2023 that Holland would appear in a live-action sequence and that his appearance had been the reason the movie was delayed from 2022 to 2023, though it turned out to be false. Christopher Daniel Barnes, who voiced Spider-Man in Spider-Man: The Animated Series (1994–1998), also expressed interest in returning for the film.  \nIn April 2022, Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Vélez were confirmed to be reprising their roles as Miles' parents from the first film while Rachel Dratch was revealed to be voicing the counselor at Miles' school. Lord, Miller, and the directors announced in June that Jason Schwartzman would provide the voice of the film's main antagonist Johnathan Ohnn / the Spot, which was added to the story after a suggestion from producer Avi Arad (a second antagonist was later written out of the movie). Powers noted that the Spot was one of \"the deepest cuts in Spider-Man's rogue gallery\" but the creative team was excited about his abilities, which allow the character to travel between universes. Shea Whigham and Jorma Taccone were also revealed to be voicing George Stacy and the Vulture, respectively. Taccone previously voiced Norman Osborn / Green Goblin and Peter Parker / Spider-Man from the 1967 TV series in Into the Spider-Verse. In November 2022, Daniel Kaluuya was confirmed to be voicing Hobart \"Hobie\" Brown / Spider-Punk in the film. In December 2022, with the reveal of the film's first poster, it was confirmed that the Peter Parker / Spider-Man from The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008–2009) would appear in the film. Spectacular showrunner Greg Weisman was not informed about the inclusion of his show's character and expressed doubts he would even be featured in the film itself. In January 2023, Nicolas Cage confirmed he would not be reprising his role of Spider-Man Noir for the film. In February 2023, it was revealed that Karan Soni was cast as Pavitr Prabhakar / Spider-Man India in the film. In April 2023, it was reported that Andy Samberg was playing Ben Reilly / Scarlet Spider. A report confirmed his casting in May 2023, when it was also confirmed that Amandla Stenberg would play Margo Kess / Spider-Byte.  \nDelilah, a skilled assassin who serves as the bartender at the Bar with No Name in an alternate universe, was meant to make an appearance in the film, but her scene was cut. She would later be included in the Insomniac Games video game Spider-Man 2 (2023), whose Peter Parker / Spider-Man appears in the film.  \n### Animation and design  \nThe main universes visited during the film, designed to look like they were each drawn by a different artist  \nLord revealed that design work for new characters in the film had begun by November 2019, with comic book artist Kris Anka later revealing that he was serving as a character designer on the film. On June 9, 2020, the film's lead animator Nick Kondo announced that production had started. The different universes visited in the film were designed to look like they were each drawn by a different artist. Having learned new animation tools after working on The Mitchells vs. the Machines (2021) following the first Spider-Verse film, Lord and Miller ambitiously employed them to develop six different animation styles. The intent was to amaze the audience whenever the characters cross into a new environment so the film can accurately reflect its plot and the styles can generate various emotional backdrops. Earth-65, the home of Gwen Stacy, was designed to look like \"impressionistic\" watercolor paintings. The animation team created a simulator to generate this style and used a visual palette that reflects Gwen's emotions like a \"three dimensional mood ring\". According to co-director Justin K. Thompson, the reflection of her emotions through colors is inspired by a scene in 1950's Cinderella where her dress gets torn, and the environment reacts to that trauma. This style was also intended by Miller to remind the audience about the covers of the Spider-Gwen comic books. One of the two alternate Earths seen in the trailer was Earth-50101, which the crew nicknamed \"Mumbattan\" after Mumbai and Manhattan, due to that world being based on the one from Gotham Entertainment Group's Spider-Man: India comic book series. To give the character Pavitr Prabhakar unique motion and fighting style, the creative team researched the 2000-year-old Indian martial arts, Kalaripayattu, from the state of Kerala. The other universe was Nueva York, the futuristic New York City from the Marvel 2099 world, based on the neo-futurist illustrations by Syd Mead, which has an unfinished look.  \nWhile the cast and crew were being interviewed for Empire in March 2023, codirector Joaquim Dos Santos revealed that another universe would be \"the punky New London, inhabited by Daniel Kaluuya's Spider-Punk\", with a final dimension \"being kept tightly under wraps for now\", later revealed to be Earth-42, the world the spider that bit Miles came from and where he has become that world's version of the Prowler. Spider-Punk's animation style took two to three years to develop and is inspired by collage imagery of 1970s punk-rock album covers, posters, and zines emulating the look of Xerox prints, colored papers and images appropriated from magazines and newsprints, and has a general grayed-out quality due to copy machines not having toner in them. Also the animators experimented with different frame rates in order to reflect DIY punk visuals and Spider-Punk's anarchic personality and tendency of inconsistency. His body is animated on 3s or 2s (8 or 12 images), his guitar on 4s (6 images), and his outline on 2s or 1s (12 or 24 images); unlike rest of the characters that are predominantly animated on 2s. In May 2023, Jake Johnson revealed in an interview that a Lego universe would be featured in the film. The Lego sequence was done by 14-year-old Canadian animator Preston Mutanga and was added late in the movie, after the filmmakers were so impressed by his fanmade Lego recreation of the film's first teaser that they tracked him down and recruited him.  \nMiles' design was updated for the sequel to show him having gone through a growth spurt, while Gwen was given a new haircut and an updated costume. Rick Leonardi, the co-creator of Spider-Man 2099, was brought on to adapt his own designs for the film, while comic book artist Brian Stelfreeze was chosen to shape the visual development of Jess Drew. The Spot's design, which was influenced by Austrian artist Egon Schiele, evolves throughout the film as he gains more confidence and control of his abilities, beginning with a style that looks like an \"unfinished sketch with blue construction lines that evoke a comic book artist's rough drawing before the work goes to an inker\". The Spot's portals were intended to look like \"living ink that had spilled or splattered on the comic artist's drawing\", which created new challenges for the animation team. The Vulture was given a Renaissance-era design inspired by the artwork of Leonardo da Vinci's workbooks. Thompson also revealed that the design of the spider in the \"Go Home Machine\" is influnced by the spider in the movie Krull (1983), which is also named \"Ynyr\" after a character from the film.  \n### Post-production  \nIn May 2023, Powers revealed that the film would end on a cliffhanger and co-director Dos Santos compared it to the Star Wars original trilogy film The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Powers explained:  \nIn the same month, Powers also stated that the film would not be \"tied\" to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In the film, Miguel makes a direct reference to the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, telling Gwen to not \"get him started on Doctor Strange and that little nerd back on Earth-199999\" — referring to the Doctor Strange and Spider-Man of the MCU — while attributing the events of No Way Home to the collider explosion from Into the Spider-Verse. The quote is meant as a throwaway line that Lord and Miller came up with. Additionally, Donald Glover reprises his role as an alternate version of Aaron Davis / Prowler from the MCU film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) in a live-action cameo, depicted as a prisoner of the Spider-Society displaced from his home reality. When asked in an interview with Lord and Miller at a press junket if it were the same Prowler from the MCU, Miller responded \"That is for you to decide. You know, all things are possible in the multiverse.\" Lord also responded with \"We were also trying to give nods to the people that have fallen in love with these characters in other mediums.\" Production on Across the Spider-Verse was completed on May 20, 2023, 13 days before the U.S. release date. With a runtime of 140 minutes, it is the longest animated film ever produced by an American studio, surpassing Consuming Spirits (2012).  \n### Allegations of poor working conditions  \nOn June 23, 2023, Vulture reported that four people who worked on the film alleged that production had faced difficulties due to numerous requests from Lord for changes to already finished animation, as well as the need for him to approve animation layouts early in production. Lord's directions were said to take precedent over the decisions of the film's directing team and led to numerous weeks of long overtime as the animators drastically revised portions of the film several times. They further stated that difficult working conditions caused by the constant revisions caused over 100 artists to leave the project before its completion. One artist said that production on Beyond the Spider-Verse, the film's sequel, had not progressed, and that there was \"no way that\" it would be completed in time for its scheduled March 2024 release window. Sony denied the allegations concerning Across the Spider-Verses production troubles, while declining to comment on the possibility of the sequel being delayed, and producer Amy Pascal called the process of heavy revision normal.  \n## Music  \nDaniel Pemberton confirmed in December 2020 that he would return to compose the sequel's score. In December 2022, Lord and Miller confirmed that Metro Boomin would create music for its soundtrack. Several artists were featured on it, including Coi Leray, Swae Lee, Future, Don Toliver, James Blake, Offset, Wizkid, Lil Uzi Vert, 21 Savage, Lil Wayne, Nas, ASAP Rocky, Becky G, Shenseea, JID, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, and 2 Chainz. For the Japanese release, an original song, \"Realize\" performed by Lisa, was featured. The film was supported by another single, \"Mona Lisa\" by Dominic Fike, released on June 2, 2023—the day of the film's premiere. Although originally set to be released as a track on the deluxe edition of the soundtrack album, a few days after its release, the track was removed. On June 23, 2023, it was announced that the track was added into some versions of Fike's second studio album Sunburn, which was released on July 7, 2023.Better source needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable (WP:NOTRS).|date=July 2023  \nThough external to the film's score and soundtrack, Daniel Kaluuya also incorporated musical elements into his vocal performance as Spider-Punk / Hobie Brown. Kaluuya elaborated that he searched for the word \"Spider-Punk\" on Spotify, hoping to find fan-made playlists. He stated that after finding some he \"would just listen to them, be like vibing out,\" helping him with the process of gauging the character's energy. Kaluuya further noted that \"he wanted the character's voice to feel like a song,\" and that a take in which he portrayed the character as \"rapping, but in a punk style\" would be the one used in the film.  \n## Marketing  \nIn May 2020, Sony entered into a promotional partnership with Hyundai Motor Company to showcase their new models and technologies in the film. A prologue for the film was released at Comic Con Experience in December 2021, revealing the title and the fact that the film is a two-part sequel. Following the announcement of the new title and release date in April 2022, Lord and Miller showed 15 minutes of the film (with unfinished animation) at Sony's CinemaCon panel. Lord, Miller, and the directors showed the same footage at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in June, with updated animation and effects. In February 2023, Funko Pops figures based on characters from the film were revealed. In April 2023, another 14-minute footage was previewed at Sony's CinemaCon panel. A second trailer was released on April 4. It gained 148.6M views within 24 hours, becoming the most-viewed second trailer for a Marvel film within that timespan and also the most-viewed superhero film trailer of the summer. Rolling Stone Larisha Paul remarked that Miles wanted the other heroes to accept and validate him but also wanted to create his own story and not be controlled by them. Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly felt the Spider-People were more antagonistic and that Miles' family was in more danger than in the first film. Meanwhile, Abid Rahman from The Hollywood Reporter compared Miles' introduction to the Spider-People in the trailer to the \"vibe\" of Citadel of Ricks and highlighted the reference to the Spider-Man pointing meme. Commentators also noted that the trailer posited that Miles could potentially have to choose between saving the multiverse or his family.  \nOn May 15, 2023; the film started the sale of different Spider-Verse themed food items for their collaboration with Burger King. The items available during the promotion included the Spider-Verse Whopper with a red bun and the Spider-Verse Sundae. On May 20, 2023, Nike released a special iteration of the Air Jordan 1 High OG inspired by the film. On May 23, 2023, Epic Games added skins of Miles Morales and Spider-Man 2099 to Fortnite based on their designs in the film. The electronics manufacturer ZOTAC also partnered with Sony Pictures to create limited-edition Spider-Man-themed RTX 4070 graphics cards.  \n## Release  \n### Theatrical  \nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse premiered on May 30, 2023, at the Grand Rex in Paris, France, and at the Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 2, in premium large formats and IMAX. Unlike the first film, this film was not released in 3D. It was originally set for release on April 8, 2022, but was shifted to October 7 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was then moved to the June 2023 date. It was the first Sony Pictures Animation film since The Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019) to receive a worldwide theatrical release after a number of the studio's animated films were assigned direct-to-streaming releases on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video in response to the closure of cinema theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nIn China, the film premiered in Beijing on May 31, and was released on June 2. The film's release initially was delayed until June 22, 2023, in the MENAefn|This statement is referring to many cinemas/movie theaters in the MENA region who have changed the release date on their official websites, and stopped the sale of tickets. Some cinemas include: VOX Cinemas (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Lebanon, Kuwait, Egypt, Bahrain), ROXY Cinemas (UAE), Grand Cinemas (Lebanon, Kuwait, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia). All of these theaters in the MENA region state June 22, 2023, as the release date of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, in all countries where they operate. region, but later withdrawn from cinemas across the region due to the film's transgender iconography.  \nOn June 9, 2023, in response to complaints of sound mixing issues from viewers in some theaters, Sony sent an updated version of the film with new audio mixing to theaters. An official source told Variety that, while the issues were only present at a \"handful of theaters\", all prints of the film had been updated and re-sent to cinemas. It was reported that at least two versions of the film—distinct in slight differences in dialogue and animations—exist in theaters. For example, in one version, a scene between Miguel and Lyla ends with Lyla giving a fist bump, while another ends in Lyla taking a selfie of them. The film's associate editor, Andy Leviton, confirmed the reports on Twitter.  \n### Home media  \nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was released on digital download by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on August 8, 2023, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 5. The digital release of the film featured additional alterations from the initial theatrical cut, such as the removal of several lines of dialogue. This version, which was also available in some theaters, was described by Miller as \"an international version\" of the film created to help with the necessary translations needed and to be approved by the French censorship board. He added that the animators \"cleaned up and tweaked\" some of the shots that had already been submitted for the finished version, with other members of the team, such as in the sound department, also suggesting alternate ideas, stating, \"Because it's a multiverse movie, it's like there's a multiverse of the movie – that was really the reasoning behind it. It was trying to make the best possible version that everyone was going to be the proudest of.\" Lord believed some of these changes created an improved film. Some of the alterations have been controversial with the film's fanbase.  \nIn April 2021, Sony signed deals with Netflix and Disney for the rights to their 2022 to 2026 film slate, following the films' theatrical and home media windows. Netflix signed for exclusive \"pay 1 window\" streaming rights, which is typically an 18-month window and included the sequels to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; this deal built on an existing output deal that Netflix had signed with Sony Pictures Animation in 2014. Disney signed for \"pay 2 window\" rights for the films, which would be streamed on Disney+ and Hulu as well as broadcast on Disney's linear television networks.  \nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was made available on Netflix in the United States on October 31, 2023, becoming the first Sony Pictures Animation film to be available via Netflix since the expiry of an identical deal expired in May 2014.date=October 2023  \n## Reception  \n### Box office  \nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse grossed $381.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $308.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $690 million. The film surpassed Into the Spider-Verses total gross of $384.5million after 12 days of release, and overtook The Smurfs to become Sony Pictures Animation's highest-grossing film.  \nIn the United States and Canada, Across the Spider-Verse was released alongside The Boogeyman, and was initially projected to gross around $80 million from 4,313 theaters in its opening weekend, with rival studios predicting it could reach $90 million. It made $17.35 million from Thursday night previews, the third-best total for an animated film after The Lion King ($23 million in 2019) and Incredibles 2 ($18.5 million in 2018). After making $51.7 million on Friday (including previews, the best first-day of 2023 up to that point), weekend estimates were increased to $113 million. It went on to debut to $120.7 million, the second-highest opening weekend total of 2023 (behind The Super Mario Bros. Movies $146.4 million) and the eighth-best ever for an animated film. It also surpassed Hotel Transylvania 2 ($48.4 million in 2015) to achieve the highest opening weekend for a Sony Pictures Animation film.  The film made $55.5 million in its second weekend, finishing second behind newcomer Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. It then made $27.8 million in its third weekend, finishing third. The film would make $19.3 million on its fourth weekend, topping the box office once again amidst competition from No Hard Feelings, a new release, and The Flash and Elemental, both holdovers.  \nOutside of the US and Canada, the film grossed $88.1 million from 59 markets in its opening weekend. In its second weekend, Across the Spider-Verse grossed $47 million, for a drop of 44%, while in its third weekend, it grossed $27.6 million from 60 markets, including Japan where the film made $2.8 million. post=, the highest grossing territories were China ($49.6million), UK ($35million), Mexico ($27.8million), Australia ($20.6million) and France ($13.4million).  \n### Critical response  \naccess-date=June 2, 2023 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 93% overall positive score, with 82% saying they would \"definitely recommend\" it.  \nBrian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, writing, \"Like the work of a young artist who refuses to be restrained by the borders of the frame, Across the Spider-Verse is loaded with incredible imagery and fascinating ideas. It is a smart, thrilling piece of work that reminded me of other great part twos like The Dark Knight and The Empire Strikes Back.\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film 3/4 stars, calling it \"an extravagant, very cool love letter to graphic design, executed with superb draftsmanship and giddy, infectious joy.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave it 3 out of 4 stars, writing, \"It's a bit too much at times, but it's also pretty great, and it'll be a huge surprise if the third chapter in the trilogy isn't equally entertaining.\" Kevin Maher of The Times gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing, \"It rarely draws breath between set pieces, and creates distinct and spectacular environments for each separate spider-verse.\"  \nDavid Fear of Rolling Stone said that the film \"completely recaptures the panel-to-panel thrill of discovering your respective era's teen-angsty Marvel icon. The thrill of the multiversal new is gone. Everything else, however, is extra-webbed for your pleasure.\" Alison Willmore of Vulture wrote, \"Across the Spider-Verse looks incredible, even better than the groundbreaking first installment, but what's truly impressive about it is how willing it is to entrust its storytelling to its animation.\" The Atlantics David Sims wrote that the film \"avoids seeming like a physics lesson because its visuals are consistently thrilling; the most static bits of dialogue still pop because of how daring the animation is.\"  \nKyle Smith of The Wall Street Journal described the film as being \"visually hypercaffeinated\", but with a slow plot in the first half of the film, plotlines being a \"hectic series of clashes\", action sequences that were \"jumpy but not especially engaging\", and \"too many long monologues\". Jake Wilson of The Age gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Typically for Lord and Miller, the upshot is both adventurous and conformist, an outwardly bold reimagining of the material that never stops congratulating us for our brand loyalty, and which plays it safer in plot terms than the early sequences might lead you to hope.\"  \n#### Transgender iconography and censorship  \n<image>A screenshot from the film, showing Gwen Stacy in her room with a \"Protect Trans Kids\" transgender flag on the right, above the doorframe\nThe film briefly features a transgender flag in two scenes, including on a banner seen hanging in Gwen Stacy's bedroom with the words \"Protect Trans Kids\". The flag's appearance led to speculation that Gwen supports her universe's transgender rights movement or some to interpret Gwen as being transgender herself. Although she is not identified as transgender in the film, viewers and critics who supported this interpretation additionally pointed to the use of the flag's colors (light pink, light blue, and white) elsewhere in scenes involving Gwen and her universe, and the perceived parallels to coming out in her character arc within the film. However, others have noted that the blue and white colors were already used by the comics' version of Spider-Woman Gwen Stacy, and thus were not necessarily proof that the film version of the character is trans. The use of the transgender flag was reported to have led to the film being withdrawn from release in the United Arab Emirates and other MENA countries.\n\n### TikTok trend  \nAn Internet meme involving the \"canon event\" began spreading on TikTok after the film's release, which later became a trend. According to TheBeauLife, it was inspired by the core memories meme in Inside Out (2015). The meme's word \"canon\" elaborated its special defintion as \"ironic (if not actually painful)\" experiences in real-life.  \n### Accolades  \n## Future  \n### Sequel  \nA third film was confirmed when Lord and Miller revealed in December 2021 that Across the Spider-Verse was being split into two films. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part Two) was expected at that point to be released in 2023. In April 2022, it was retitled Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. In response to a claim by an artist on Across, who spoke to Vulture on condition of anonymity, that it would not be possible to release Beyond as scheduled (which at that point had been on March 29, 2024) due to an alleged lack of production progress, Lord and Miller stated that the production would \"take the time necessary\" for the film to be completed to their standards. In July 2023, the film was removed from the release schedule, reportedly due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, as a source within Sony—a member of the AMPTP against whom SAG-AFTRA is negotiating—told Variety that the strike precluded the film's voice cast from recording their lines on schedule.  \n### Spin-off  \nSony began developing a Spider-Women film in November 2018 that would focus on three generations of female, Spider-related characters. Bek Smith was writing the spin-off, and Lauren Montgomery was in talks to direct. Pascal said the film would focus on the characters Gwen Stacy / Spider-Gwen, Cindy Moon / Silk, and Jess Drew / Spider-Woman, and said Across the Spider-Verse would serve as a \"launching pad\" for it. In May 2023, producer Avi Arad stated that the film would be titled Spider-Woman.  \n### Manga spin-off  \nOn May 29, 2023, it was announced that a manga spin-off titled Spider-Man: Octopus Girl written by Hideyuki Furuhashi and illustrated by Betten Court would begin serialization on June 20 on Shueisha's Shōnen Jump+ website and app. The story revolves around Doctor Octopus, who falls into a coma and has been reawakened in the body of young Japanese middle schooler named Otoha Okutamiya.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the development of the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse sequel is true?\nChoice list: \nA. The sequel was initially planned as a single film but was later split into two parts due to the size of the story.\nB. The sequel was always intended to be two separate films from the beginning.\nC.

Born to an Italian Sephardic Jewish family based in London, after he achieved success, he donated large sums of money to promote industry, business, economic development, education and health among the Jewish community in the Levant. He founded Mishkenot Sha'ananim in 1860, the first Jewish settlement outside the Old City of Jerusalem.  \nAs President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, he corresponded with Charles Henry Churchill, the British consul in Damascus, in 1841–42; his contributions are seen as pivotal to the development of Proto-Zionism.  \n## Early life  \nMoses Montefiore was born in Leghorn (Livorno in Italian), Tuscany, in 1784, to a Sephardic Jewish family based in Great Britain. His grandfather, Moses Vital (Haim) Montefiore, had emigrated from Livorno to London in the 1740s, but retained close contact with the town. It was known for making straw bonnets. Montefiore was born while his parents, Joseph Elias Montefiore and his young wife Rachel, the daughter of Abraham Mocatta, a powerful bullion broker in London, were in the town on a business journey. His aunt was Selina Hannah Laurence (née  Montefiore 1768-1838), an ancestor of Sir Timothy Laurence.  \n## Career  \nPortrait of Moses Montefiore  \nThe family returned to Kennington in London, where Montefiore attended school. His family's precarious financial situation prevented Montefiore from completing his schooling and he went out to work to help support the family. After working for a wholesale tea merchant and grocer, he was hired by a counting house in the City of London. In 1803 he entered the London Stock Exchange, but lost all of his clients' money in 1806 in a fraud perpetrated by Joseph Elkin Daniels. As a result, he probably had to sell or give up his broker's licence.  \nIn 1812, Montefiore became a freemason, joining the Moira Lodge, No. 92 of the Premier Grand Lodge of England in London. Between 1810 and 1814 Montefiore was part of the Surrey Militia. In 1815, he again bought a broker's licence, and briefly operated a joint venture with his brother Abraham until 1816. He largely closed down his trading activities in 1820.  \nIn 1812, Moses Montefiore married Judith Cohen (1784–1862), daughter of Levy Barent Cohen. Her sister, Henriette (or Hannah) (1783–1850), married Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836), for whom Montefiore's firm acted as stockbrokers. Nathan Rothschild headed the family's banking business in Britain, and the two brothers-in-law became business partners. In business, Montefiore was an innovator, investing in the supply of piped gas for street lighting to European cities via the Imperial Continental Gas Association. In 1824 he was among the founding consortium of the Alliance Assurance Company (which later merged with Sun Insurance to form Sun Alliance).  \nThough somewhat lax in religious observance in his early life, after his visit to the Holy Land in 1827, Montefiore became a strictly observant Jew. He traveled with a personal shohet (ritual slaughterer), to ensure that he would have a ready supply of kosher meat. Although Montefiore spent only a few days in Jerusalem, the 1827 visit changed his life. He resolved to increase his religious observance and to attend synagogue on Shabbat, as well as Mondays and Thursdays when the Torah is read. The visit had been a \"spiritual transforming event\" for him.  \nIn 1831, Montefiore purchased a country estate with twenty-four acres on the East Cliff of the fashionable seaside town of Ramsgate. The property had previously been a country house of Queen Caroline, when she was still Princess of Wales. It was next owned by the Marquess Wellesley, a brother of the Duke of Wellington. Soon afterward, Montefiore purchased the adjoining land and commissioned his cousin, architect David Mocatta, to design a private synagogue, known as the Montefiore Synagogue. It opened with a grand public ceremony in 1833.  \nMontefiore is mentioned in Charles Dickens' diaries, in the personal papers of George Eliot, and in James Joyce’s novel Ulysses. It is known that he had contacts with Protestant non-conformists and social reformers in Victorian England. He was active in public initiatives aimed at alleviating the persecution of minorities in the Middle East and elsewhere, and he worked closely with organisations that campaigned for the abolition of slavery. A Government loan raised by the Rothschilds and Montefiore in 1835 enabled the British Government to compensate plantation owners under the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 and abolish slavery in the Empire.  \nIn 1836 Montefiore became a governor of Christ's Hospital, the Bluecoat school, after assisting in the case of a distressed man who had appealed to him to help his soon-to-be-widowed wife and son. Montefiore was elected Sheriff of the City of London in 1837. He was knighted in November 1837.  \n## Retirement  \n<image>Montefiore synagogue and tomb of Montefiore in Ramsgate, England\nAfter retiring from business, Montefiore devoted the rest of his life to philanthropy. He was president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews from 1835 to 1874, a period of 39 years, the longest tenure ever, and member of Bevis Marks Synagogue. As president, he corresponded with the British consul in Damascus, Charles Henry Churchill, in 1841–42; a practice seen as pivotal to the development of Proto-Zionism.  \nFrom retirement until the day he died, Montefiore devoted himself to philanthropy, particularly alleviating the distress of Jews abroad. He went to the sultan of the Ottoman Empire in 1840 to liberate from prison ten Syrian Jews of Damascus arrested for blood libel in a case known as the Damascus affair; to Rome in 1858 to try to free Jewish youth Edgardo Mortara, who had been seized by the Catholic Church after allegedly being baptised by a Catholic servant; to Russia in 1846 (where he was received by the Tsar) and 1872; to Morocco in 1864, and to Romania in 1867. These missions made him a folk hero of near mythological proportions among the oppressed Jews of Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Levant.  \nMontefiore received a baronetcy in 1846 in recognition of his services to humanitarian causes on behalf of the Jewish people.\n\n## Philanthropy in Ottoman Palestine  \nMontefiore on his 100th birthday  \nHe and his wife travelled to Palestine after the region was wracked by an earthquake in 1836. The towns of Safed and Tiberias were particularly damaged, with the few survivors suffering disorder, terror and disease. Moses and Judith launched an ambitious programme of relief in 1837.  \nIn 1854 his American friend Judah Touro, also a Sephardic Jew, died after having bequeathed money to fund Jewish residential settlement in Palestine. Montefiore was appointed executor of his will, and used the funds for a variety of projects to encourage the Jews to engage in productive labor. In 1855, he purchased an orchard on the outskirts of Jaffa that offered agricultural training to the Jews.  \nIn 1860, he built the first Jewish residential settlement and almshouse outside the old walled city of Jerusalem, which today is known as Mishkenot Sha'ananim. This became the first precursor of the New Yishuv. Living outside the city walls was dangerous at the time, due to lawlessness and bandits. Montefiore offered financial inducement to encourage poor families to move there. Montefiore intended Mishkenot Sha’ananim to be a new type of self-sufficient, sanitary settlement where Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews lived together. Later on, Montefiore established adjacent neighborhoods south of Jaffa Road, the Ohel Moshe neighborhood for Sephardic Jews and the Mazkeret Moshe neighborhood for Ashkenazi Jews, who had distinctly different traditions and languages.  \n<image>Montefiore Windmill in Mishkenot Sha'ananim\nMontefiore donated large sums of money to promote industry, education, and health amongst the Jewish community in Palestine. The project, bearing the hallmarks of nineteenth-century artisanal revival, aimed to promote productive enterprise in the Yishuv. The builders were brought over from England. These activities were part of a broader program to enable the Old Yishuv to become self-supporting in anticipation of the establishment of a Jewish homeland.  \nMontefiore built the Montefiore Windmill in an area that later developed as the Yemin Moshe neighbourhood, to provide cheap flour to poor Jews. He also established a printing press and textile factory, and helped to finance several Bilu agricultural colonies. The Jews of Old Yishuv referred to their patron as \"ha-Sar Montefiore\" ('The Prince' or simply 'Prince' Montefiore), a title perpetuated in Hebrew literature and song.  \nMontefiore commissioned several censuses of the Yishuv, or Jewish community in Palestine: these were conducted in 1839, 1849, 1855, 1866 and 1875, and provided much data about the people. The censuses attempted to list every Jew individually, together with some biographical and social information (such as their family structure, place of origin, and degree of poverty).\n\n## Later life and death  \nSeal of the \"Kerem Moshe Montefiore and Yehudit\" Society in Jerusalem (\"Vineyard of Moses and Judith Montefiore\" Society in Jerusalem); inscribed in Hebrew and German  \nMontefiore played an important role in Ramsgate affairs, and one of the local ridings still bears his name. In 1845 he served as High Sheriff of Kent. In 1873, the year of his 89th birthday, a local newspaper mistakenly ran his obituary. \"Thank God to have been able to hear of the rumour\", he wrote to the editor, \"and to read an account of the same with my own eyes, without using spectacles.\"  \nThe town celebrated his 99th and his 100th birthdays in great style, and every local charity (and church) benefited from his philanthropy. At East Cliff Lodge, he established a Sephardic yeshiva (Judith Lady Montefiore College) after the death of his wife in 1862. In the grounds he built the elegant, Regency architecture Montefiore Synagogue and mausoleum modeled on Rachel's Tomb outside Bethlehem. (He also paid for the refurbishment and upkeep of this historic tomb.) Judith was laid to rest there in 1862.  \nMontefiore died in 1885, at age 100 years and 9 months. He had no known children. His principal heir in name, arms and property was his nephew Sir Joseph Sebag-Montefiore (1822-1903, born Joseph Sebag), a British banker, stockbroker and politician.  \nSir Joseph's descendant, British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore (born 1965), revealed that his family believes Sir Moses to have fathered a child late in life with a 16-year-old domestic servant. Philanthropist Leonard Montefiore was a great-nephew of Sir Moses Montefiore. Sir Moses Montefiore was buried in the Montefiore Synagogue at Ramsgate.  \nThe estate was sold to the Borough of Ramsgate around 1952, and the Lodge was demolished in 1954. All that remains today is a new building housing a firm of architects. It incorporates parts of the original structure, called the Coach House. There are also some outbuildings that survive (including the Gate House). The Italianate Greenhouse has been restored to its former glory in the early 21st century. The Greenhouse and the rest of the estate are now protected as King George VI Memorial Park. A plaque on the Gate House honors Sir Moses.  \n## Legacy  \nOld Israeli Shekel, 1978  \nThe Montefiore Home for Chronic Invalids in Manhattan and the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, US are both named after him. Montefiore Square, a small, triangular park in upper Manhattan's Hamilton Heights neighbourhood, is named after Montefiore Medical Center.  \nA branch of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US also bears his name. Chicago's West Side is home to a reform school of higher education, Moses Montefiore Academy, named in honour of him.  \nA number of synagogues were named in honour of Montefiore, including the 1913 Montefiore Institute, now preserved as the Little Synagogue on the Prairie.  \nThe Montefiore Club was a private social and business association, catering to the Jewish community located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  \nIn Cleveland, Ohio, US, a Jewish nursing homes is called Montefiore.  \nHe was commemorated on two Israeli banknotes. These were the IL10, which was in circulation from 1970–79, and the IS 1, which was legal tender from 1980 to 1986.  \nThe Dolphin's Barn Jewish cemetery in Dublin, Ireland, is dedicated to Montefiore.  \n## Anecdote  \nMontefiore was renowned for his quick and sharp wit. A popularly circulated anecdote, possibly apocryphal, relates that at a dinner party he was once seated next to a nobleman who was known to be an anti-Semite. The nobleman told Montefiore that he had just returned from a trip to Japan, where \"they have neither pigs nor Jews.\" Montefiore is reported to have responded immediately, \"in that case, you and I should go there, so it will have a sample of each\" (a similar anecdote is told of Israel Zangwill.)  \n## Coat of arms\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the contributions of the person associated with the structures shown in these images?\nChoice list: \nA.

Initially, the militia units were centered on the 35 counties that then existed in the Province of North Carolina.  The units fought against the British, Loyalists, and Cherokee Native Americans that aligned themselves with British forces.  The units included military district brigades established in 1776, county regiments, four battalions, and one independent corps of light horse. Four regiments were located in counties that became part of the Southwest Territory in 1790 and later Tennessee in 1796. The size of brigades could be up to a few thousand volunteers. Brigades were commanded by a brigadier general.   Regiments were commanded by a colonel and made up of a number of companies commanded by captains with about 50 men in each company.  During engagements, one or more companies of regiments may have been involved in actions and commanded by the regimental or brigade commander.  In 1778, Major General John Ashe was selected to command all North Carolina militia and State Troops.  Brigade commanders reported to him.  Separate from the North Carolina militia, the state provided 10 numbered regiments to the Continental Army that were referred to as the North Carolina Line.\n\n## Background  \nIn August 1775, the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress of North Carolina delegates appointed Cornelius Harnett the head of the Council of Safety which oversaw resistance to British rule. They also divided the colony into six military districts for the purpose of organizing militia and arranging representation in the executive body of the Council of Safety. At the county level, there were Committees of Safety, including the Rowan, Anson, Mecklenburg, Surry, and Tryon counties.  Many members of these committees of safety became the officers of the regiments of militia.  \nThe North Carolina Provincial Congress authorized 35 existing county militias to be organized on September 9, 1775.  Some counties had already established their militias earlier than 1775.  The Rowan County regiment was split on October 22, 1775 into two distinct regiment, the 1st Rowan County Regiment and the 2nd Rowan County Regiment.  On December 22 that same year, the North Carolina Provincial Council split the Pasquotank County Regiment into two separate and distinct regiments, the 1st and 2nd Pasquotank County regiments.  The two additional regiments brought the total number of county regiments to 37 by the end of 1775.  \n## Units  \nThe following are the North Carolina militia brigades and regiments with their subordination, along with the dates established and disestablished, as well as the original commander when the unit was established by the Provincial Congress.  Many counties started mustering and training militia before the Provincial Congress got around to it, as early as October 1774 (Johnson County Regiment). Regiments were subordinated to named brigades after brigades were established in 1776.  Brigades were headed by a brigadier general and subordinate to the state militia headed by a major general officer, who reported to the Governor of North Carolina.  As new counties were created by the legislature, new regiments were created and some were disbanded.   At the time of the Battle of Kings Mountain in October 1780, there were 50 counties and 51 regiments of militia.  Many regiments had two colonels.  Soldiers and officers from these units were engaged in battles and skirmishes, primarily in North Carolina and South Carolina, but a few engagements were in Georgia, Virginia, and East Florida.  As militia units, the soldiers did not serve full-time and returned home between engagements, musters, and drills.\n\nQuestion: Which individual served as the commander of the New Bern District Brigade, as well as the 2nd and 4th North Carolina Militia during the American Revolution?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# The Indian Bean Tree, St James Square, Monmouth  \nSt James Square in Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales is the site of a historic Indian Bean Tree.  \nThe Catalpa bignonioides, a native of the southeastern United States, was planted in the square in about 1900. It was joined by the Monmouth War Memorial in 1921. After more than one hundred years of presiding over the square, the tree became the focus of controversy when it was condemned by the Monmouthshire County Council in 2005. The decision was met with fierce community opposition. The parties involved resolved their differences in 2006, and the tree received treatment, albeit some of it unauthorized. By 2011, the Indian Bean Tree in St James Square was flourishing.  \n## Twentieth-century history  \n\"There are some lovely spots in the town centre, none prettier than St James's Square, with its old war memorial in the shadow of a romantic-looking tree.\" The tree mentioned in The Telegraph of 25 February 2006 was a reference to the Indian Bean Tree (pictured) that was planted in St James Square in Monmouth about 1900. Properly known as Catalpa bignonioides, it is a native of the southeastern United States. At the time of the unveiling of the Monmouth War Memorial (pictured) in 1921, the Catalpa was already a mature tree. In 1946, a rod was installed to support the main limbs of the tree. The Indian Bean Tree is considered by the Monmouth Action Group to be \"one of the best examples of the species in Britain.\" It is thought to be one of the oldest and largest specimens in the United Kingdom. The Indian Bean Tree is positioned behind the war memorial and surrounded by lawn, with an adjacent formal planting of flowers. The cenotaph, tree, lawn, and garden are enclosed by railings.  \n## Controversy  \n<image>Metal supports were placed under some large branches of the Indian Bean Tree c. 2006.\nThe Indian Bean Tree's poor health was brought to the attention of the Monmouthshire County Council in summer 2005 by one of the judges of the Wales in Bloom competition. The tree was subsequently condemned by the council. A spokesperson for the council indicated that the reason for taking down the tree was to avoid the possibility of litigation. The council was concerned that portions of the tree could fall and result in damage to people or property. In response, the Monmouth Town Council, Monmouth Archaeological Society, and Monmouth Action Group collaborated and hired an arboriculturalist, Roy Finch, to investigate the condition of the Catalpa. The tree surgeon indicated that the Catalpa was “an outstanding part of our tree heritage and worthy of the effort and expense involved in its management.” He recommended treatment of the Indian Bean Tree to reduce the associated risks and to extend the life of the tree.  \nThe county council requested a second analysis by a different professional, Steve Ambler. That report, before November 2005, also concluded that the Catalpa could be made safe; however, the second evaluation suggested that the tree would probably die within a few years, even if treatment was undertaken. A revised report from Roy Finch of Malvern failed to dissuade the county council from their plan to condemn the Catalpa. Rather, it was reported in November 2005 that the council had solicited bids to fell the tree in St James Square in the face of intense opposition from the community. The Monmouthshire County Council continued to state that the tree was dangerous, in part due to its proximity to a school. The decision of the council was that the tree should be felled, and replaced with a new Catalpa.  \nArchaeologist Stephen Clarke, chairman of the Monmouth Action Group, suggested that there was a conflict of interest with regard to the actions of the Monmouthshire County Council. He indicated that council members were \"the guardians of the conservation area and so they just give themselves permission. The locals can do very little about it.\" Clarke recommended that residents continue to fight to maintain their local heritage. However, as an example of the difficulties inherent in saving Monmouth's heritage, the archaeologist mentioned that the town formerly had \"one of the most beautiful urban parks in the country, Drybridge Park, where every tree that would grow in Britain used to be planted but they've nearly all been chopped down.\" Clarke stated that, in a survey conducted by  British Archaeology, \"Monmouth was once classified as one of Britain's top 10 historical towns.\" The BBC News reported on 30 December 2011 that Monmouth had at one point been rated by the Council for British Archaeology as the seventh best town (for archaeological purposes) in Britain.\n\n## Progress to resolution  \n<image>Indian Bean Tree with supporting rods, behind Monmouth War Memorial, Nov 2007\nOn 9 January 2006, Stephen Clarke made a presentation to the Monmouth Town Council. He submitted a new evaluation of the Catalpa by Jerry Ross, a third expert. Ross was of the opinion that, while the tree was in poor health, it was \"far from dying.\" Clarke reminded council members that this was the third expert that had been hired, the first commissioned by the groups that he represented, Roy Finch, and the second commissioned by Monmouthshire County Council, Steve Ambler. Clarke indicated to the town council that members of the county council had dismissed the most recent evaluation performed by the third professional. The archaeologist also advised the town council that he and the chief executive of the county council were at odds with regard to the terminology used to describe the health of the tree, as well as the quantity of correspondence that had been received in support of the Catalpa. Clarke suggested that another evaluation be commissioned. As the county council was still intent on felling the Indian Bean Tree, Clarke had asked lawyers to seek a judicial review. Fundraising efforts included the sale of images of the Catalpa.  \nIn February 2006, it was reported that the Monmouth Archaeology Group and Monmouth Action Group had arranged for another (fourth) expert to investigate the health of the Indian Bean Tree. Arborist David Lonsdale advised that any risk posed by the Catalpa could be diminished with a two-fold approach: cutting back the top of the tree and supporting the main branches. The results of the investigation were communicated to the Monmouthshire County Council. The Indian Bean Tree at St James Square was of particular interest due to both its size and its status as one of the oldest specimens of Catalpa in the United Kingdom. The opinion of the arborist was that the value of the Catalpa merited the expense of inspection and arbor care. In addition, it was proposed that financing of the arbor work could be accomplished by utilizing the funds that had initially been targeted for felling the old tree and planting a new specimen. Lonsdale cautioned that the health of the tree would eventually deteriorate, despite treatment.\n\n## Outcome  \nThe fourth expert's evaluation of the Catalpa's condition met with a positive reception at the Monmouthshire County Council. The council worked with the Monmouth Town Council and Monmouth Action Group, and looked into performing the remedial arbor care. Treatment was undertaken, including crown reduction and general pruning that were completed by April 2006. In addition, temporary cable props had been placed by that month to support and strengthen the tree. Estimates for supporting rods were obtained: £1500 for stainless steel and £3000 for oak. Outside funding was sought to defray the expense of the tree props. Later, metal supports (pictured) were installed under some large branches of the Indian Bean Tree.  \nHowever, it was suspected that the late John \"Mad Jack\" Roocroft (September 1930 – January 2011), an eccentric Troy Way, Monmouth resident known for his flouting of authority, was responsible for the sudden absence of a large branch of the Indian Bean Tree which had overhung the street at St James Square. Although there was no proof, it was generally believed that it was the former millionaire's distinctive red tractor and trailer, laden with segments of the large limb, that had been spied headed away from the square early one day. His removal of the massive branch is felt to be partially responsible for the recovery of the Catalpa (link to 2011 photograph of Catalpa in bloom below). Roocroft, the son of a Lancashire farmer, had previously used his chain saw on trees in the Nelson Garden. In 2004, he applied his saw to five conifers in the garden, his reasoning being that they were not original to the Nelson Garden's 1802 design. In his February 2011 tribute to Roocroft, Stephen Clarke wrote, \"Good night Jack, I dare say that there will be flowers for you to plant in Heaven, beans for you to grow and Catalpa Trees for you to prune, and of course, authority for you to annoy.\"\n\nQuestion: What action was taken to help preserve the Indian Bean Tree in Monmouth, as depicted in the images?\nChoice list: \nA. The tree was relocated to a different area to ensure its survival.\nB. Metal supports were placed under some large branches to provide structural support.\nC. The tree was pruned extensively to reduce its size and weight.\nD.

Contested over 110 laps, it was the sixteenth race of the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season and the first of two road course competitions on the schedule. Clint Bowyer of Michael Waltrip Racing took his first win of the season, while Tony Stewart finished second and Kurt Busch finished third.  \n## Report  \n### Background  \nSonoma Raceway is one of two road courses to hold NASCAR races, the other being Watkins Glen International. The standard road course at Infineon Raceway is a 12-turn course that is km long; the track was modified in 1998, adding the Chute, which bypassed turns 5 and 6, shortening the course to km. The Chute was only used for NASCAR events such as this race, and was criticized by many drivers, who preferred the full layout. In 2001, it was replaced with a 70-degree turn, 4A, bringing the track to its current dimensions of km.  \nBefore the race, Matt Kenseth led the Drivers' Championship with 565 points, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. stood in second with 561. Greg Biffle was third in the Drivers' Championship with 548, sixteen points ahead of Jimmie Johnson and thirty-four ahead of Denny Hamlin in fourth and fifth. Kevin Harvick, with 504, was seven points ahead of Martin Truex Jr., as Tony Stewart with 491 points, was ten ahead of Clint Bowyer and thirty-three in front of Brad Keselowski. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was leading with 105 points, eighteen points ahead of Toyota. Ford, with 77 points, was twenty-eight points ahead of Dodge in the battle for third. Kurt Busch was the defending race winner.  \nFive teams chose to temporarily replace their regular drivers with road course ringers. One of which was Tommy Baldwin Racing, who replaced regular David Reutimann with Tomy Drissi, while another was FAS Lane Racing who chose Boris Said to replace regular drivers, Reed Sorenson and Ken Schrader. Humphrey Smith Racing also changed drivers, with Mike Bliss, racing at Road America in the Nationwide Series on the weekend, being replaced with Chris Cook, while Phil Parsons Racing replaced Michael McDowell with David Mayhew and Inception Motorsports co-owner David Stremme stepped aside in favor of Brian Simo. Robby Gordon also qualified for his first race since Auto Club Speedway.  \n### Practice and qualifying  \n<image>Marcos Ambrose, from Richard Petty Motorsports, won the pole position\nThree practice sessions were scheduled to be held before the Sunday race—one on June 22, 2012, and two on June 23, 2012. The first session lasted 90 minutes. The second session was 45 minutes, while the final session finished after 75 minutes.  Jeff Gordon was quickest with a time of 75.653 seconds in the first session, less than two-tenths of a second faster than Truex Jr. Bowyer was just off Truex Jr.'s pace, followed by Joey Logano, Kyle Busch, and Ryan Newman. Marcos Ambrose was seventh, still within a second of Gordon's time.  \nForty-four cars were entered for qualifying, but only forty-three could qualify for the race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Ambrose clinched the second pole position of his career, with a record setting time of 75.203 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Gordon. Johnson qualified third, Biffle took fourth, and Truex Jr. started fifth. Bowyer, Kyle Busch, Kurt Busch, Kenseth and Newman rounded out the top ten. The driver that failed to qualify for the race was Brian Simo. Following the qualifying session, Ambrose stated, \"I beat myself up here in 2010.It was nothing to do with the car or the track. It was me. I know what not to do on the last restart.\" Afterward, third-placed Johnson commented, \"It was on edge the whole lap. I don't want to drive 110 laps the way it drove today.\"  \nIn the second practice session, Gordon remained quickest with a time of 75.961 seconds. Ambrose, with a time of 76.718, was second quickest, ahead of Allmendinger, Juan Pablo Montoya, and Keselowski. Kyle Busch, Johnson, Truex Jr., Bowyer, and McMurray completed the first ten positions. Gordon continued to be quickest through the third practice session with a time of 76.846, 0.885 slower than his fastest lap during the second session. Biffle was second quickest in the session, while Montoya was scored third. Johnson followed in the fourth position ahead of Allmendinger, Hamlin and Edwards. Truex Jr., Kahne and Kyle Busch rounded out the first ten positions in eighth, ninth and tenth, respectively.\n\n### Race  \nThe race, the fifteenth in the season, began at 3:21 p.m. EDT and was televised live in the United States on TNT. The conditions on the grid were dry before the race with the air temperature around °C. Track minister Tim Boeve began pre-race ceremonies, by giving the invocation. Next, University of California Straw Hat Band performed the national anthem, while Tony LaRussa and Toby Appleton, a Toyota Military Hero, gave the command for drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, David Gilliland had to start last on the grid after missing the mandatory drivers meeting. After leading 13 laps, Gordon would reach the 23,000 career laps led mark, the most of any current Sprint Cup Series driver.  \n## Results  \n### Qualifying  \nNotes  \n1 — David Gilliland started last on the grid because of missing the mandatory drivers meeting.  \n2 — Stephen Leicht also had to start in the rear of the grid after his team changed engines.  \n### Race results  \n<image>Clint Bowyer won the race.\n\n\n## Standings after the race  \nDrivers' Championship standings  \nManufacturers' Championship standings  \n* Note: Only the top five positions are included for the driver standings.\n\nQuestion: Who won the pole position for the race described in the provided images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Rusco Tower  \nRusco Tower, sometimes called Rusco Castle, is a tower house near Gatehouse of Fleet in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. Built around 1500 for Mariota Carson and her husband Robert Gordon, on lands given to them by her father, it was used to incarcerate a number of the Gordons' rivals in the 16th century. After Robert Gordon died and Carson remarried, their eldest son James Gordon seized the tower and imprisoned his mother, fearing that she would make it over to her new husband, Thomas Maclellan of Bombie. Gordon went on to kill Maclellan on the High Street in Edinburgh, while a court case intended to settle the matter was ongoing.  \nThe Gordons sold the tower in the 17th century, and it was inhabited continuously until the late 19th or early 20th century. By the middle of the 20th century the building was uninhabited and had fallen into a state of disrepair. In 1971 it was designated a Category A listed building, and was shortly afterwards purchased and renovated by Graham Carson, a Scottish businessman, who went on to live in it from 1979 until 2006. Carson attempted to discover whether his family was related to the Carsons who originally owned the estate, but was unable to document a connection. It remains in the Carson family, and is still used as a domestic dwelling.  \nThe tower was the subject of a poem, \"Rusco Castle, a Tale of the Olden Time\", published in 1841.  \n## Name  \nThe building's name is recorded by Historic Environment Scotland as Rusco Tower,2020 but some authors refer to it as Rusco Castle, and it is sometimes spelled Rusko.2020 In 1515, when a charter was signed at the tower, its name was recorded as \"Ruschen\", and it appears in records of 1575 as \"Ruschew\".  \n## Description  \nRusco Tower is located about 0 north of Gatehouse of Fleet, on a wooded hillside looking down into the valley of the Water of Fleet. It is a rectangular tower house, four storeys high including its attic,2020 with a wall walk inside its parapet. Its overall design is very similar to that of nearby Cardoness Castle, on a slightly smaller scale, and it is possible that it was constructed by the same builder.  \n<image>A view of the tower from the south east, published in 1889.\n\n\n### Exterior  \n<image>The tower's east elevation.\nThe external footprint of the tower is rectangular, roughly 0 by 0, and it is about 0 high. Stone water spouts project from the roof, cannon-shaped to the east frontage, and U-shaped on the other sides. Within the parapet, which is crenellated and supported by chequered corbels, there is a garret, and in the south east corner is a cap-house: a small attic covering the stairway and opening onto the wall walk.  \nThe chamfered windows are small and irregularly placed,2020 and corniced on the upper floors; their projecting lintels, unusual in Scotland, seem to have been intended to cast off rain. In the west and east faces, the ground floor walls are pierced by gunloops, shaped like inverted keyholes, in a style similar to that of Cardoness. The main entrance, on the ground floor of the north wall, has a broad segmental arch, and was formerly a doorway into a (now demolished) 17th-century extension; the less elaborate original entrance remains, in the centre of the east front. Above it is a worn heraldic plaque with two shields: the upper one, supported by a pair of unicorns, bears the Royal Arms of Scotland, while the lower shield shows a quartered coat of arms, probably for Gordon and Carson, although only a G is still discernible.  \nOn the north side of the building, the lower sections of the west and north walls of a 17th-century extension survive. This was already dilapidated by the 19th century, and most of it has since been demolished.\n\n### Interior  \nThe tower is noted for its unusual sophistication in the arrangement of small rooms built into the thickness of its walls,2020 which are up to 1 thick in places. Also built into the thickness of the walls is a turnpike stair with a newel, which ascends the full height of the tower.2020 The ground floor, which has an entresol level, is vaulted, and is divided into a number of store rooms and guard rooms, some with gun loops, and one with a trap door dropping down to a windowless dungeon. The entresol is tunnel vaulted, and occupied by a single room with windows in the south and east walls. It is likely that the ground floor was originally used to accommodate horses or cattle, with the entresol providing a sleeping place for servants.  \nTaking up most of the first floor is the great hall, 1 by 1 in size, with a beamed ceiling supported by corbels projecting from the walls, and arched windows. One of the stone seats in the west window serves as a step up to a concealed door. This gives access to a small room, again built into the thickness of the wall, which has an external window and also a laird's lug (Scots language for lord's ear): a small listening hole into the hall.  \nThe second floor and the attic, which would each originally have been occupied by single large rooms, have been subdivided.  \n## History  \n<image>19th-century plans and sections of the tower, still showing the 17th-century extension\n\n\n### Construction  \nThe tower was built between 1494 and 1504 for Mariota Carson (or Acarsane) and her husband, Robert Gordon, within the Glenskyreburn estate that had been gifted to them by her father, John Carson. Gordon, heir to the Lochinvar estate, took on the designation \"of Rusco\" after its completion, and is sometimes referred to by his wife's surname in records. He was brought before the Lords of Council in 1501 or 1502, charged with the destruction of a house on Crown lands within the barony of Kirkandrews in order to remove timber and slates, possibly to be used for the construction of Rusco Tower; he claimed that the house belonged to him, but was unable to prove it, and was ordered to pay 1,000 merks in damages.  \n### 16th century  \nGordon was forced to leave Rusco soon after it had been constructed. With his brother Alexander, he was implicated in the murder of John Dunbar of Mochrum around 1503, and  \nwhile his brother fled the country, Gordon was put to the horn, a form of punishment similar to outlawry, and his possessions were confiscated; his estate was let by the crown to a neighbour. In 1507, while still under the horn, Gordon was given permission to travel to France, and in 1511 he was given a pardon for his part in the crime, and allowed to return to Scotland and take up his estate once more. By 1516, he had been knighted.  \nRusco Tower was used to incarcerate a number of people in the 16th century. Gordon seized and imprisoned Janet Porter, an heiress who had recently married John McCulloch, a lesser member of the Cardoness McCulloch family. Gordon attempted to force her to sign over her inheritance, the Blacket estate, to him instead of her new husband, and McCulloch, who was not powerful enough to recapture his wife by force, applied to the courts. Gordon did not appear at the hearing, but in his absence the court ordered him to return Porter to her husband. It is not clear whether the order was obeyed, but records show that the Gordon family came to own the Blacket estate shortly afterwards.  \nGordon spent several years in litigation with the Agnews of Lochnaw, who were related to him by marriage. In 1523 he sought to bring the legal dispute to an end by abducting Andrew Agnew, the heir of Lochnaw and his own grandson, and imprisoning him at Rusco. When the boy's uncle, Matthew Agnew, demanded that he be returned within three days, Gordon claimed that he had been placed in a school in Dumfries. The records do not show how this affair was concluded.  \nRobert Gordon died in 1524, and within a year his wife Mariota Carson married Thomas Maclellan of Bombie. Since she owned Rusco Tower and its lands in her own right following the death of her husband, there would have been nothing to prevent her from leaving them to her new husband's family upon her death; her eldest son, James Gordon of Lochinvar, was so concerned that this might happen that he seized Rusco, where his mother was still living, and had her transported to the Borders and imprisoned. Her husband appealed to the courts, but before the case was concluded Maclellan was killed, in broad daylight, by Gordon and his retinue on the High Street in Edinburgh.  \n### Later history  \nThe later history of the tower was less turbulent. It was of minor importance to the Gordons once they had taken possession of Lochinvar, and was mostly used as accommodation for minor family members. It was sold in the 17th century, around which time a two-storey extension was added to the north side.2020 It was described in the poem \"Rusco Castle, a Tale of the Olden Time\" published in 1841 by Dugald Williamson of Tongland.  \nThe tower was lived in until the late 19th or early 20th century, but was abandoned and allowed to fall into ruin between the First and Second World Wars.  \nIn 1971, Rusco Tower was designated a Category A listed building.2020 The following year, it was purchased by Graham Carson, a Scottish businessman, who employed the architect W. Murray Jack to restore it to an inhabitable condition. The work was completed in 1979, and Carson moved into the tower with his family. Carson had a great-grandfather who was born in Wigtonshire, close to Rusco, and he attempted to find any connection between his family and the Carsons who had originally built the tower, but was never able to do so.2012 He lived in the tower until 2006, when he moved out and his son, Ian, took up residence;2012 as of 2018, Ian Carson was still living at Rusco Tower.2018\n\nQuestion: Which feature is common to the tower as depicted in the 19th-century illustration, the current photograph of the east elevation, and the 19th-century plans and sections?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Reginald Marix  \nAir Vice Marshal Reginald Leonard George Marix, DSO (17 August 1889 – 7 January 1966) was a British aviator, originally with the Royal Naval Air Service, who later reached air officer rank in the Royal Air Force. He is credited with being the first pilot to destroy a Zeppelin, when in October 1914 he bombed the airship sheds at Düsseldorf. A flying accident in 1916 ended his flying career, but he remained in the Royal Air Force, serving in various staff positions, and during the Second World War commanded two reconnaissance groups, and from 1943 to 1945 the group responsible for ferrying aircraft from North America to Europe.  \n## Early life and flying career  \nMarix was born on 17 August 1889 in Kensington, London, and educated at Radley College and the Sorbonne, Paris. In 1909 he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, rising to the rank of leading seaman, before being commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve on 1 November 1912, and posted to HMS Actaeon to attend the flying course. Marix learned to fly at the Bristol School on Salisbury Plain, where he was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 403 on 14 January 1913, after soloing a Bristol Boxkite. He was then transferred to the Central Flying School at Upavon for further instruction, being appointed a flying officer and posted to the Naval Flying School at RNAS Eastchurch on 17 April. The aircraft at Eastchurch, under Commander Charles Rumney Samson, formed the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps and flew a variety of aircraft, including Shorts, Blériots, Deperdussins, Avros, Sopwiths, and Farmans. On 17 April 1914 Marix was promoted to lieutenant, and on 1 July was appointed a flight lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Service, which was founded on that day.  \n## First World War  \nOn 4 August 1914 Britain declared war on Germany, and three RNAS squadrons were soon deployed to Belgium and France primarily to fly reconnaissance missions, but also found themselves operating armoured cars. In early September an RNAS unit, comprising six aircraft from three squadrons was sent to Wilrijk aerodrome in Antwerp. Under the orders of Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, it was tasked with mounting the first long-distance bombing raids on Germany. Their targets were the airship sheds at Düsseldorf and Cologne, in order to forestall Zeppelin raids on England. For the first mission on 22 September, Baron Pierre de Caters provided a force of Belgian armoured cars which was sent out to create and defend a forward landing strip west of the Meuse, as the British aircraft did not have sufficient range to fly directly to their targets and back. The raid was commanded by Squadron Commander Eugene Gerrard, who with Flight Lieutenant Marix, headed for Cologne, while Squadron Commander Spenser Grey and Lieutenant Charles Collet flew to Düsseldorf. Their Sopwith aircraft had no fixed machine-guns, the pilots being armed only with revolvers, and carried only two or four adj=on Hales bombs. By the time the four aircraft crossed the River Roer, fog obscured the ground and Collet was the only pilot to find his target, the airship shed at Düsseldorf. He dropped his bombs from a low level, but only one hit the shed, and it failed to explode.  \n<image>Replica of the Sopwith Tabloid (No. 168) in which Marix bombed the airship hangar at Düsseldorf, RAF Museum Hendon.\nOn 28 September Antwerp came under attack by German heavy guns, and the RNAS aircraft assisted the Belgian defenders by flying artillery spotting missions. However, by early October, with the fall of the city seemingly inevitable, most of the RNAS unit was evacuated. On 8 October Grey and Marix took off in two Sopwith Tabloids which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks to attempt another raid. (Contemporary despatches and accounts state that Flight Lieutenant Sydney Vincent Sippe also took part in the raid, but was forced down before reaching German territory by a mechanical failure.) Grey arrived over Cologne to find it obscured by mist, and was again unable to find his target, so dropped his two bombs on the railway station. Marix had more luck, finding his target at Düsseldorf and dived from 3,000 to 500 feet before releasing his bombs, in the face of heavy rifle and machine fire from the ground. As he pulled away a fireball 500 feet high erupted from the shed, which contained the fully inflated airship LZ 25. Marix's aircraft sustained some damage from anti-aircraft fire, but he managed to fly to within 20 miles of Antwerp before having to land, and travelled by train and a borrowed bicycle to the aerodrome, which he found deserted apart from Grey, Sippe, and a party of Royal Marines. They promptly left the city by truck. Antwerp fell to the Germans the following day. Marix subsequently received a mention in despatches, and on 21 October, Grey, Marix and Collett were awarded the Distinguished Service Order. On 31 October Marix was promoted to flight commander.  \nIn late 1914 Marix was flying reconnaissance near Ypres, but a mechanical fault forced him to land. He walked to the British lines and returned to his aircraft with a party of four Marines, only to find five German Uhlans inspecting his aircraft. The Marines opened fire, and four Germans promptly mounted their horses and fled. The fifth Uhlan's horse was wounded, so he ran off, pursued by Marix, who eventually took him prisoner at gunpoint. The two men returned to the aircraft where Marix courteously lent his captive a revolver to administer the coup de grâce to his suffering mount, before taking him back to the British lines.\n<image>Flight Commander Marix and his Farman MF.11 aircraft at Tenedos, Gallipoli, 1915.\nMarix served in the Gallipoli Campaign during through most of 1915, flying reconnaissance and bombing missions. On 17 May Marix spotted unusual activity at the small port of Ak Bashi Liman. With Samson as his observer he returned that afternoon, flying a Breguet aircraft armed with one adj=on and fourteen adj=on bombs. Marix attacked the port, stopping work there for two days. A further reconnaissance flight led the British to conclude that the Turks were preparing an attack on Anzac Cove, and as a result their assault of 19 May was effectively repulsed with great loss of life. Marix later received a mention in despatches from the Vice-Admiral Commanding the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron.  \nMarix was promoted to squadron commander on 1 January 1916, and in February formed a new squadron of Sopwith 1½ Strutters based at RNAS Detling, with the intention of mounting bombing raids on factories in the Essen and Düsseldorf areas, though it proved that the aircraft lacked the range to make these attacks successfully. However, in May 1916, a new Anglo-French strategic bombing force was created, under the command of Wing Captain William Leslie Elder, of which Marix's squadron formed the nucleus. Designated No. 3 Wing RNAS, the British aircraft were based at Luxeuil-les-Bains, close to France's eastern frontier, and comprised Sopwith 1½ Strutters and Breguet Bre.5 bombers. The first raid was mounted on 30 July when a mixed force of nine French and British aircraft attacked Mülheim. In September Marix and another pilot stopped at Paris while ferrying two Strutters to Luxeuil. They were invited to test fly a Nieuport, but Marix's aircraft broke up in mid-air, and he was seriously injured, having his left leg amputated, thus bringing his combat flying career to an abrupt end. Marix recovered from his accident, returning to serve as a staff officer. In August 1917 he was made a Chevalier of the Order of the Crown by the King of the Belgians. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and Marix transferred into the new service.\n\n## Inter-war career  \nMarix remained with the RAF post-war and on 1 August 1919 was awarded a permanent commission with the rank of major (later squadron leader). On 12 November he was appointed a temporary Staff Officer (2nd class) at the Air Ministry, and went on to serve as a member of the Inter-Allied Aeronautical Committee of Control (Germany) from 16 June 1920, and then as Officer Commanding, Motor Transport Repair Depot from 25 October 1921, until 11 April 1922. On 11 July 1922 he was awarded the Croix de Guerre avec palme by the King of the Belgians for his \"valuable services rendered in connection with the war\". From 25 September 1922 Marix served at the RAF Electrical and Wireless School, then on 15 January 1924 was posted to the Air Ministry, to serve on the Staff of the Directorate of Operations and Intelligence until 13 October 1924. He was placed on half-pay from 25 February to 16 September 1925, and on 24 September he was posted to the Air Staff of RAF Mediterranean. On 8 October 1928, he was transferred to the Department of the Chief of the Air Staff in the Directorate of Organisation and Staff Duties, serving there until 11 July 1932, and also receiving promotion to wing commander on 1 July 1930.  \nOn 12 September 1932 Marix was posted to Malta where he served as Officer Commanding of the RAF Base at Kalafrana, home of No. 202 (Flying Boat) Squadron, until taking command of RAF Hal Far on 16 April 1934. In June 1934 he was awarded an Interpretership (2nd class) in French from the RAF Staff College. Marix was promoted to group captain on 1 January 1936, and on 27 April returned to command at Kalafrana, remaining there until 9 November.  \nMarix then returned to England, where on 1 February 1937 he was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer, in the Headquarters of No. 16 (Reconnaissance) Group, based at Lee-on-Solent. He was appointed Officer Commanding No. 16 Group on 14 March 1939 and, following the granting of the acting rank (unpaid) of air commodore on 23 August, Air Officer Commanding.  \n## Second World War  \nOn 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Marix was granted the acting rank of air vice marshal. He was promoted to the temporary rank of air commodore (acting air vice-marshal) on 1 January 1940, and a week later was appointed Deputy Senior Air Staff Officer of Coastal Command. On 11 July 1940 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath \"in recognition of distinguished services rendered in recent operations\". On 24 March 1941 he became Air Officer Commanding, No. 18 (Reconnaissance) Group. On 10 February 1942 Marix relinquished his acting rank of air vice marshal, and on 10 March became Air Officer-in-charge of Administration of Ferry Command, which took over the ferrying of new aircraft from factories in North America to the UK from the civilian Atlantic Ferry Organisation. On 11 June 1942 Marix received his third mention in despatches, and on 1 October 1942 his temporary rank of air commodore was made substantive.  \n<image>Aircraft at Dorval Airport awaiting delivery to the UK via the North Atlantic route.\nOn 25 March 1943 Ferry Command was redesignated No. 45 (Atlantic Ferry) Group within the newly created Transport Command. On 1 April Marix was appointed Air Officer Commanding, No. 45 Group, and granted the acting rank of air vice-marshal for the second time on 11 April, which was made temporary on 1 June. On 12 June he was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta (2nd class) by the President of the Republic of Poland. As AOC, No. 45 Group, Marix was based at Dorval Airport, Montréal, Canada. The Group comprised two ferrying wings, No. 112 (North Atlantic) Wing and No. 113 (South Atlantic) Wing, a Training Wing and a Communications Squadron, in all employing over 5,000 service and civilian personnel. On 4 January 1945 Marix arrived in Australia on an inspection tour of a new trans-Pacific ferry route from Canada to Australia, run by No. 45 Group in collaboration with the American Air Transport Command, in anticipation of increased activity in the South West Pacific theatre. He commanded No. 45 Group until replaced by Air Vice Marshal George Beamish on 15 June 1945. Marix then served at the Headquarters of Transport Command, until retiring from the RAF on medical grounds on 6 December 1945, retaining the rank of air vice marshal.  \nAir Vice Marshal Marix died on 7 January 1966. In May 2016 his medals, logbook and service revolver were donated to the RAF Museum by his 91-year-old daughter-in-law Yvelene de Marcellus Marix in Washington D.C.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image shows the aircraft that Flight Commander Marix used during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915 for reconnaissance and bombing missions?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Girls' toys and games  \n<image>A girl in Udaipur playing \"Jungle Child\"\nGirls' toys and games are toys and games specifically targeted at girls by the toy industry. They may be traditionally associated either exclusively or primarily with girls by adults and used by girls as an expression of identity. One commentator have argued that the market for girl's toys and games is more challenging than that for boys' toys and games.\n\n## Background  \nGames and toys, or types of play, in many cultures are gender (and age) neutral, but some are given a gender role (masculine or feminine). Games given a gender role are exclusive or segregationist, and a game labelled as such is often considered by both children and adults as appropriate for boys or girls but not both. Members of a culture that designated a game's gender role, as well as outsiders, may have difficulty discerning why it has that gender role. Some games, such as many sports, are or were officially gender segregated, and the gender role given a toy or game may affect its marketing.  \n## Age compression  \nGirls assembling a puzzle  \nAge compression is the modern trend of children moving through play stages faster than they did in the past. Children have a desire to progress to more complex toys at a faster pace, girls in particular. Barbie dolls, for example, were once marketed to girls around 8 years old but have been found to be more popular in recent years with girls around 3 years old. The packaging for the dolls labels them appropriate for ages 3 and up. Boys, in contrast, apparently enjoy toys and games over a longer timespan, gravitating towards toys that meet their interest in assembling and disassembling mechanical toys, and toys that \"move fast and things that fight\". An industry executive points out that girls have entered the \"tween\" phase by the time they are 8 years old and want non-traditional toys, whereas boys have been maintaining an interest in traditional toys until they are 12 years old, meaning the traditional toy industry holds onto their boy customers for 50% longer than their girl customers.  \nGirls gravitate towards \"music, clothes, make-up, television talent shows and celebrities\". As young children are more exposed to and drawn to music intended for older children and teens, companies are having to rethink how they develop and market their products to them.  Girls also demonstrate a longer loyalty to characters in toys and games marketed towards them. A variety of global toy companies have marketed themselves to this aspect of girls' development, for example, the Hello Kitty brand, and the Disney Princess franchise. Boys have shown an interest in computer games at an ever-younger age in recent years.date=April 2021  \n## Pink phenomenon  \nRows of pink girls' toys in a Canadian store, 2011  \n<image>Girls in Barbie Fashion Show in Children's Museum of Indianapolis\nIn Western countries in recent years, girls' toys and games have shifted towards a dominant use of the colour pink. Those shopping for girls' toys can easily spot the girls' toy section in a store because of the rows of aisles almost entirely stacked with bright pink products. There has been a backlash against the predominant use of pink in girls' toys. One British parent launched a campaign called Pinkstinks against retailers marketing educational toys to girls in pink. The almost exclusive use of pink for girls' toys has raised concern that it is polarizing gender identity from an early age, to the detriment of girls, by over-emphasizing beauty and passivity over fun and creativity.  \nThe reasons why girls may as a group prefer pink are not clear. Theories are divided between the nature versus nurture question. Social conditioning is one possible factor, since girls are surrounded by pink accessories and clothing from birth in some cultures. However, it has been proposed that a preference for pink is \"hard-wired\". One recent study showed \"a marked preference for pink among girls and women in different cultures\". Ben Goldacre has noted that it is likely to be cultural given that less than a hundred years ago pink was deemed the most appropriate colour for boys.  \nAmplifying gender identity differences between boys and girls is to the benefit of toy sellers. Targeted marketing has for many decades used the technique of categorizing children into segments for marketing purposes, much as the industry does with adults. Childhood age segments that are popularly believed to be identified by psychologists were in fact invented by children's clothing and toy manufacturers. Peggy Orenstein has drawn attention to research by Daniel Cook (a \"historian of childhood consumerism\"), that reveals the marketing origins of the age group known as \"toddler\":\n\n## Tween marketing  \nGirls playing in a park in the Netherlands  \nSimilarly, the age group known as tweens was a marketing invention dating to the mid-1980s to describe children aged eight to 15. Tween marketing has spread beyond Western countries. In India, marketing research shows children in the 8- to 14-year-old age range, predominantly girls, shifting their preferences away from traditional products towards mass-marketed merchandise such as the Disney Princess and Frozen franchises.  \nTween girls became identified as a huge market during the 1990s. The pop music group the Spice Girls were an act based on a group of female performers representing character traits, with nicknames such as Scary Spice, Baby Spice, and Sporty Spice. They were originally a less edgy variation on the girl-group character acts such as the Mary Jane Girls organized by Rick James and Vanity 6 created by Prince, with an intended teenage audience. To the surprise of the recording industry, the Spice Girls were an enormous success with prepubescent tween girls, who identified with the flirtatious sexuality of the group and the \"Girl Power\" theme, which marketers subsequently promoted to the hilt. In 1998, the year the Spice Girls enjoyed their peak success, tweens spent an estimated $1.4 billion, according to a YTV Tween report. Marketing to tween girls is a full-fledged entertainment industry trend today, with toys and merchandise associated with television shows, music groups and celebrities, for example Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez.  \nIn addition to toys such as dolls marketing to girls, they use common ideas and representations of toys that will make the biggest profits. Taking a look at Barbie dolls, there are many different editions of Barbie that make tributes to celebrities and other aspects of culture. Some of these editions include Marilyn Monroe, Diana Ross, Audrey Hepburn, Harley Davidson, and many more. The company Mattel uses idea they know will sell best, in addition to this they make sure the dolls have a certain appearance; small waist, thin legs, and large breasts. They are marketing not only what gives the biggest dollar value, but as well as following the guidelines for typical views of beauty within these types of toys. The toys along with the messages they send about body images are then mass produced to be sold to the audience of mostly girls ranging from toddlers to tweens. The dolls often lack many features that would help make them more realistic, and send believable body image message to girls. Some of the features neglected to be shown on dolls such as Barbie's include: nipples, wombs, skin flaws, and the various skin tones found around the globe. This leaves the realistic view of women out, and instead changes it for blank features that is wanted by the public.  \n## Technology and toys  \nHello Kitty Dreamcast set, 2009  \nTechnology has been embraced by many toy companies because of the gender-neutral best-selling toys that it helps create. One example is the popular Tamagotchi toy invented in Japan in the 1990s. It has sold tens of millions of units worldwide in its various versions. The Tamagotchi is an egg-shaped computerized toy that mimics a pet, and requires that the user update it regularly to feed it and provide other care. It remains particularly popular with young girls, however, and recent marketing is targeted towards girls; girls \"like the new outfits and other items that can be downloaded via cellphone and transferred to their Tamagotchi device\".  \nGirls' video games were a trend in the 1990s where video game developers attempted to make video games aimed specifically at girls. The genre did not see much critical or commercial success, and a leading developer, Purple Moon, was bought by Mattel in 1999.  \nIn 2014, Moose Toys developed Shopkins toys which are about one inch in size and targeted at girls. Shopkins later released a number of Shopkins games for Android and iOS devices, and in  Adobe Flash format  The most popular game in the series is Shopkins World, which crossed 5 million downloads.  \nWorldwide video game sales have soared beyond traditional toy and game sales in the past decade,date=March 2018 particularly in North America and the Middle East. The Nintendo Wii console sells games aimed at either girls or boys, or both. Large traditional toy companies such as Hasbro have also created game applications for the iPhone and other smartphones, which are increasingly being used by children in affluent countries.  \n### STEM Toys  \nIn 2020, the Australian market research group PLAY reported that STEM toys (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) were trending in the toy industry, specifically those aimed at young girls. Traditionally these toys have been solely marketed towards boys, with both masculine explicit and implicit labels. \"Pinkification\" is a common strategy used in marketing to create a binary or segment the toy market by colour. This is seen in girls’ toy brands like Barbie, but it is also apparent in some of the new rebranding efforts of STEM toy makers, like GoldieBlox and Lego, who are trying to appeal to feminine audiences. While it might be a “good faith attempt at progress it could remind girls to shun anything that isn’t pink.” and be a limiting factor both girls, and the boys who may avoid pink packaging altogether. A study by Coyle and Liben examined the effects of gender–typed packaging in STEM toys on mother-child dyads. This study found that children had differential comfort with toys packaged for their own experienced gender but resulted less attention and mastery of the specific STEM concept. Girls were found to generally learn the concept better playing with the masculine version but were freer to play and explore the pieces with original version, and vice versa for boys.  \n## History  \n<image>Detail from Children's Games by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1560), showing Flemish girls playing popular games of the era\nPaintings of girl with dolls  \nThe oldest toys for girls are dolls that date from around 2000 BCE in Egypt. Children in Ancient Greece played with dolls made of rags, wood, wax or clay, sometimes with moveable arms and legs. Rattles, hoops and yo-yos were other common toys. When a young woman was to be married in Ancient Greece, she would sacrifice her dolls and toys and other youthful possessions to Artemis the night before her wedding.  \nChildren's games during the Middle Ages and earlier are something of a mystery, since the rules of the games were passed from generation to generation orally. In rare cases, the games survived long enough to be recorded in later centuries. Pieter Bruegel's painting Children's Games (1560) depicts many games popular with Flemish children of the time. Girls can be shown playing games that involve balls, musical instruments, and games that involved carrying other children or performing other challenges. Hide-and-seek, leapfrog and tag are some perennially popular games that seem to have survived over the centuries in Europe and North America.  \nFashion dolls were creations used by adults in early modern Europe. Fashion dolls were prototype samples of clothing styles, passed between adults who were involved in designing or purchasing expensive dresses and suits. Once the dolls were outdated, they were apparently given to girls as toys. A recent trend in the Barbie doll line in particular is to produce \"collectors\" versions of the doll marketed to adults, with Barbie wearing historic couture reproductions.  \nBoard games, paper dolls, doll houses and other toys were creations of the Victorian era that remain popular today. Other historic and vintage girls' pastimes include Paper fortune tellers, which date from the 1920s.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a historical trend in girls' toys that has been subject to recent scrutiny and debate due to concerns about reinforcing gender stereotypes?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Salzburg Conference  \n<image>Jozef Tiso and Adolf Hitler at the Salzburg Conference\nThe Salzburg Conference (Salzburger Diktat)  was a conference between Nazi Germany and the Slovak State, held on 28 July 1940, in Salzburg, Reichsgau Ostmark (present-day Austria). The Germans demanded the expulsion of the Nástup faction of the Slovak People's Party from the Slovak government because of its independent foreign policy, threatening to unilaterally revoke the protection guarantees that Slovakia had obtained in the 1939 German–Slovak treaty.  \nThe result was Slovak capitulation to German demands and the replacement of Nástup supporters by members of the pro-German radical faction. Ultimately, the Slovak State became more strongly oriented towards Germany, especially in the area of anti-Jewish measures. However, aspects of the Slovak State's administration, such as the lack of qualified Slovak People's Party supporters in high-level positions and the adoption of the Führerprinzip with the conservative politician Jozef Tiso as its supreme leader, limited the impact of the German ultimatum.\n\n## Background  \nSlovak territorial losses to Hungary in 1938 and 1939  \n<image>Joachim von Ribbentrop (right) meets the Prime Minister of Romania, Ion Gigurtu, in Salzburg, 27 July 1940\nNazi Germany and Fascist Italy awarded much of southern Slovakia (then part of Czechoslovakia) to Hungary with the First Vienna Award in November 1938. On 14 March 1939, the Slovak State proclaimed its independence under German protection, with Germany invading and annexing the Czech rump state the following day. In a treaty signed on 23 March, Slovakia renounced much of its foreign-policy and military autonomy to Germany in exchange for border guarantees and economic assistance.  \nThe Slovak State was a one-party state dominated by the Slovak People's Party, which had two main factions, radical and conservative/clerical. The radical branch was led by Vojtech Tuka and Alexander Mach, commander of the paramilitary Hlinka Guard, and was supported by Germany due to its acceptance of German dominion. President Jozef Tiso's clerical branch was more popular among the Catholic clergy and the population. These factions engaged in a power struggle, fighting for German support. Another faction was a group of intellectuals centered around the journal Nástup, which was radical in its authoritarianism but opposed the imitation of Germany and insisted on an independent foreign policy; foreign minister Ferdinand Ďurčanský belonged to this group. Germany sought the expulsion of the Nástup group from positions of influence, as it could work with Tiso's faction which tended towards pragmatism in its foreign policy.  \nThe summit took place during a quiet spell in the war, shortly after the fall of France and while the defeat of the United Kingdom and victory of Nazi Germany appeared likely. Germany's military successes strengthened its negotiating position against its much smaller ally. Germany sought to use the favorable conditions to deepen its sphere of influence in the Danube region and force its allies in the area into a closer relationship. Shortly before the summit, Hitler had met with Hungarian officials on 10 July, and with Romanian and Bulgarian officials on the two nights immediately preceding the Salzburg meeting.\n\n## Demands  \nIn mid-July 1940, German dictator Adolf Hitler invited Tiso, Tuka, and Mach to a summit held in Salzburg. The Sicherheitsdienst wanted Ďurčanský to be invited, so that it could thwart any attempts by the latter to escape losing power.  \nOn 28 July, Tiso first met privately with German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, who informed the Slovaks that Germany considered Slovakia within its Lebensraum, and therefore justified interference in Slovakia's internal affairs. He demanded that Tiso renounce his goal of a Catholic clerical state and dismiss  Ďurčanský, due to the latter's \"register of sins\"—he had attempted to maintain communication with the Western powers and keep friendly relations with the Soviet Union. In another meeting, Adolf Hitler hinted that failure to comply would leave the Slovak State at the mercy of Hungary, by revoking the protection guarantees that Slovakia had obtained in the 1939 German–Slovak treaty. Tiso told Hitler that Slovakia had no \"leanings toward Russia within the framework of a Pan-Slavic policy. … The leaflets backing such actions were machinations of Jews, Magyars, and Czechs designed to blacken Slovakia in the eyes of Germany.\"  \nThe Slovaks requested a revision of the First Vienna Award. Specifically, they wanted six former districts to be returned to Slovakia: Vráble-Šurany, Lučenec,  Jelšava,  Košice,  north Sátoraljaújhely  and Sobrance District—km2. According to the Slovak foreign ministry, these areas contained 209,000 Slovaks and 100,000 Hungarians. During the meeting with Hitler Ribbentrop interjected to say that a revision was \"out of the question\".  \nAccording to Israeli historian Yeshayahu A. Jelinek, \"we lack many  details regarding the meeting, particularly  about instructions, if any, given to Tuka and Mach\".  \n## Result  \nTiso and Hitler shake hands at the conference  \nThe Slovaks conceded to the German ultimatum and agreed to replace influential Nástupists with reliably pro-German radicals. Ďurčanský was replaced as interior minister by Mach, while Tuka became foreign minister. sk, another Nástupist, was dismissed as Secretary-General of the Slovak People's Party, while Konštantín Čulen, the head of the Propaganda Ministry, was replaced by the radical Karol  Murgaš. Nevertheless, the Germans recognized that the radical candidates were not as competent as the men that they replaced, and were therefore careful not to go too far in demanding influential offices for them. Ďurčanský later claimed that his dismissal proved that he was anti-Nazi and actually a \"friend\" of Jews.  \nThe conference marked a success for the radical faction of the party and a defeat for Tiso's clerical faction. Tiso considered the summit \"the worst box on the ears that I ever received\". He offered his resignation. None of the Slovak leaders (except Mach) was happy with the result; Tuka had hoped to become president or defense minister and was ill-equipped to deal with the demands of the new offices he had obtained.  \nAfter the conference, the new government \"oriented definitively and exclusively on Germany\", in the words of Jan Rychlík. The conference also resulted in an intensification of the Slovak State's anti-Jewish policy, which was now modeled on that of Germany. As a reaction to the Salzburg talks, the Slovak People's Party embraced the Führerprinzip (\"Führer principle\"), putting Tiso in a position of complete authority and bypassing the German-mandated political changes. Another effect that limited the effect of the German diktat was that there were few Slovak People's Party supporters qualified for high office, partly because of the reliance of the Czechoslovak state on Czech bureaucrats. Therefore, the government relied heavily on Slovaks who did not support the party (four-fifths of the Foreign Affairs officials who had reported directly to Ďurčanský had held similar positions in the Czechoslovak government and were almost certainly not Slovak People's Party supporters). Leading officials such as Karol Klinovsk, head of the Presidium of the Slovak Foreign Ministry since 1939, were left undisturbed for lack of a qualified replacement.  \n### Advisers  \n<image>Manfred von Killinger meets Tiso (center) and Tuka (left), August 1940\nAnother result of the Salzburg talks was the appointment of various German advisers to Slovakia, although these advisers were not completely new, nor were they unique to Slovakia. The previous German envoy Hans Bernard (Diplomat) was replaced by Manfred von Killinger, a Sturmabteilung officer who described his purpose as making Slovakia \"economically  100 per  cent  at  our  disposal\". Killinger was accompanied by a staff of German economic experts. The other advisers appointed in the months following Salzburg were:  \nIncluding staff, in the end about seventy or eighty people were part of this advisory corps.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true based on the provided images and their descriptions?\nChoice list: \nA. The Salzburg Conference resulted in the Slovak State gaining full independence and foreign policy autonomy from Nazi Germany.\nB.

Born at the time of the German Empire, Krüger received his first music lessons at the age of 9 from the pianist and flutist Friedrich Ferdinand Theodor Bach, who served in the Celle 2. Hannoversches Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 77 as a musician in martial music. During his training as a pianist at the \"Louis-Krohn-Musikschule\" in Braunschweig he already wrote his first compositions. In 1910 he returned to Celle, where he continued his studies in piano and theory with Fritz Reichert and Heinrich Lutter, with whom he founded the Verein der Musikfreunde Celle. He acquired his qualification as a choir conductor by studying singing with the concert and oratorio singer Heinrich Kühlborn.  \nAlso in 1910, during the shooting festival in Celle, Krüger met his future wife Marie Suerburg (18 May 1891 in Celle - 2 February 1983 in Metzingen); the two married on 14 August 1914; the couple had two sons: Walter (21 August 1911 in Celle, killed in action 2 October 1941 in Russia) and Hans (4 April 1927 in Celle - 15 July 1986 in Metzingen).  \nDuring the First World War he served as a soldier, probably in a chapel, with an unknown place of assignment.  \nIn 1923 he founded the men's double quartet \"The Eight\".

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# John Browning (scientific instrument maker)  \nJohn Browning (c. 1831 – 14 December 1925) was an English inventor and manufacturer of precision scientific instruments in the 19th and early 20th centuries. He hailed from a long line of English instrument makers and transformed the family business from one dealing in nautical instruments to one specialising in scientific instruments. Browning was particularly well known for his advances in the fields of spectroscopy, astronomy, and optometry.  \n## Background  \nJohn Browning was born around 1831 in Kent, England, the city recorded variously as Bexley or Welling. His father, William Spencer Browning, was a maker of nautical instruments. It has been speculated that his shop inspired that of the character Solomon Gills, the ship's instrument maker, in the 1848 novel Dombey and Son by Charles Dickens. John Browning hailed from a long line of English instrument makers. His great-grandfather was instrument maker John Browning, brother of Samuel Browning, of the firms Spencer & Browning and Spencer, Browning & Rust, manufacturers of navigational instruments. The latter firm was in operation in London from 1784 to 1840, and was succeeded by the firm of Spencer, Browning & Co. Several sources indicate that John Browning's great-grandson John Browning resided in Sevenoaks, Kent.  \n## Choice of profession  \nSpectrum apparatus of John Browning  \nJohn Browning initially intended to follow the medical profession, and entered Guy's Hospital, a teaching hospital and the location of a school of medicine. Despite having passed the required examinations, however, he abandoned his plans due to ill health. Instead, he apprenticed with his father, William Spencer Browning. At the same time, in the late 1840s, he was also a student at the Royal College of Chemistry. When John Browning came of age, he joined his father in the family business. However, he decided to change the nature of the business, due to increasing competition in the making of nautical instruments. Instead, he elected to pursue the design and manufacture of scientific instruments. In 1856, he assumed sole ownership of the enterprise. The factory was at 111 Minories, London for decades; it moved to 63 Strand, London in 1872. There was an additional London workshop at 6 Vine Street. John Browning's choice of profession was somewhat unusual for a graduate of the Royal College of Chemistry. Those who were inclined to become entrepreneurs tended to enter more chemically-oriented businesses, or have been associated with them before matriculating.  \n## Scientific instruments  \n<image>Section of 1873 Guildhall menu\nBetween 1856 and 1872, Browning acquired provisional patents for designs of numerous scientific instruments. He was also the recipient of an award at the 1862 International Exhibition held in London. He was recognised for his temperature-compensated aneroid barometer. Browning's scientific instruments were used in physics, chemistry, and biology. The products he designed and manufactured included spectroscopes, telescopes, microscopes, barometers, photometers, cameras, ophthalmoscopes, and electrical equipment such as electric lamps.  \nJohn Browning installed the first electric light in London, the occasion being a banquet to honour the Shah of Persia during his visit to Queen Victoria. The location was the Guildhall, which has been used as a town hall in the City of London for hundreds of years and continues to be the home of the City of London Corporation. One light, run with Bunsen cells, was positioned outside each window, due to the fumes. The operating cost of each light was £3 per hour. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar was the Shah of Persia during the second half of the nineteenth century. During his reign, he toured Europe three times, in 1873, 1878, and 1889. It was during the 1873 trip that the mayor and the Corporation of the City of London gave a banquet in the Shah's honour. Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone arranged for the queen to entertain the Shah during the 1873 visit. Queen Victoria did not attend the banquet of 20 June 1873, which was primarily a business occasion. The elaborate preparations for the banquet included not only the costly lighting scheme, but also a gilded, illustrated menu (pictured).\n\n## Spectroscopes  \n<image>J. Rand Capron rainband spectrum published in the second (1882) edition of How to Work With the Spectroscope\nJohn Browning was perhaps best known as the leading manufacturer of spectroscopes. His were considered to be of the highest quality in England. In 1865, he supplied photographer William Henry Fox Talbot (1800–1877) with a custom-made spectroscope. His crafting of fine spectroscopes strengthened his connection to the field of chemistry. In April 1872, Browning exhibited one of his spectroscopes at the Royal Society, more formally known as the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge. In his 1878 book How to Work With the Spectroscope: A Manual of Practical Manipulation With Spectroscopes of All Kinds, John Browning provided an overview of the field of spectroscopy, and the book became well known among spectroscopists. It has been published in a number of editions, most recently on 3 June 2010 by Cambridge University Press.  \nWhile the first edition of 1878 contained only black and white images, the second edition of How to Work With the Spectroscope included one notable colour illustration (pictured). It was of the rainband spectrum by lawyer and scientist John Rand Capron. It first appeared as a black and while image in Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine. However, the second, 1882 edition of John Browning's handbook reproduced the plate in colour. It demonstrated Joseph von Fraunhofer's solar lines A-F, with the rainband adjacent to the D lines. In the late 19th century, scientists were interested in the rainband for its potential in the detection of atmospheric water vapour and, therefore, the prediction of rain. Evaluation of the rainband represented the first attempt to use spectroscopy in the field of meteorology. Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth supported the contention that water vapour bands could be used to predict rainfall in the 22 July 1875 issue of Nature. While the topic of the rainband and its use in meteorology was controversial, John Browning (and his competitors) manufactured pocket spectroscopes designed to show the rainband and marketed them as meteorological tools.\n\n## Royal Astronomical Society  \n<image>Solar automatic spectroscope of John Browning, to be used with telescopes\nAn astronomer, Browning was also Optical and Physical Instrument Maker to Her Majesty's Government. As such, he supplied telescopes to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Browning also attached spectroscopes to telescopic equipment, garnering the attention of astronomical physicists J. Norman Lockyer and William Huggins. He was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1865. Browning was a pioneer in the manufacture of reflecting telescopes and bringing them to the attention of astronomers. As the popularity of astronomy grew during the 19th century, his business in telescopes flourished. An advocate of the Newtonian reflector, he was the author of A Plea for Reflectors, Being a Description of the New Astronomical Telescopes With Silvered-glass Specula, first published in 1867. By 1876, the book was in its sixth printing. Browning wrote many articles for the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, including a series on Jupiter's equatorial belt about 1870. Browning was a perfectionist, a trait that in at least one instance had unfortunate consequences. When he delayed in providing Lockyer with a spectroscope until it performed to his high standards, Lockyer missed the opportunity of being the first astronomer to observe a prominence on the uneclipsed sun. While the delay was only partially responsible for Lockyer's missed opportunity, there is evidence that Browning long regretted his reluctance to part with the spectroscope in question. Browning made a number of instruments for Lockyer, among them an 8-inch reflecting telescope that was delivered to Lockyer in 1871 and now greets visitors near the main door of the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth, Devon. Toward the late 1860s, in his quest to produce telescopes for a growing market, Browning collaborated with George Henry With (1827–1904), former schoolmaster at the Blue Coat School in Hereford. With was talented at producing high quality, large reflecting mirrors.\n\n## British Optical Association  \nDiagram of the eye in Our Eyes (1883)  \nBy the early 1870s, practical optics had become John Browning's primary interest, and he listed his occupation as optician on the census records from 1871 to 1901. He was well known among London's ophthalmic surgeons for his various ophthalmic instruments. Browning had a large part in reforming the art of crafting spectacles. Employees of his company tested people's eyesight and made eyeglasses for them. John Browning was the author of the book, How to Use Our Eyes and How to Preserve them by the Aid of Spectacles. Published in 1883, the book included thirty-seven illustrations, including a diagram demonstrating the anatomy of the eye (pictured). In 1895, he was one of the founders of the British Optical Association, the first professional and examining organisation for optometry. He was not only its first president, but also registered as its first member, so that many consider him to be the first professional optometrist.  \n## Other professional organisations  \nBrowning was also a member of The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain. In 1871, he constructed the first wind tunnel, located in Greenwich at Penn's Marine Engineering Works. It had been designed by another member of the Aeronautical Society, British engineer Francis Herbert Wenham. He was also a member of other scientific organisations, such as the Microscopical Society of London, the Meteorological Society, and the Royal Institution.  \n## Marriage and family  \nSt Mary the Virgin Church in Lewisham, Kent, c. 1811  \n<image>Church of Holy Trinity, Clapham\nBased on census and marriage records, John Browning married at least three times. In 1871, Browning lived in Richmond, Surrey with three unmarried sisters. Browning is identified as married, but no wife or child is recorded. His occupation is identified as \"optician, master (employing 61 workpeople).\" On 18 February 1874, a widowed Browning married widow Charlotte Hotten, née Stringer, at St Mary's Church in Lewisham, Kent. His wife Charlotte, a resident of Lewisham, was the daughter of William Stringer. Browning's father was recorded as William Browning (deceased). Both his occupation and that of his father were listed as optician. In 1881, John Browning was in residence at Croydon in Surrey. He lived with his wife Charlotte, sister Emma, and daughter Maria Browning, as well as stepdaughters Florence and Gertrude Hotten. John Browning's profession was listed as \"master optician employing 20 men.\" He was widowed in 1888, his wife Charlotte dying on 13 March 1888 in Croydon.  \nWidower John Browning remarried on 24 July 1890 at the Holy Trinity Church, Clapham, on Clapham Common London, at the time recorded as Surrey. He married Annie Woolley, a spinster whose place of birth and residence at the time of their marriage was Chapel Hill in Monmouthshire, Wales. She was the daughter of Josiah Woolley, a licensed victualler, and his wife Harriet Woolley. Her age was listed as 25 years old, thirty years younger than that recorded for her husband. Their marriage record and John Browning's death record are most probably responsible for the difference in dates of birth cited for John Browning in a variety of publications. The marriage record suggests that he was born around 1835, with a given age of 55 at marriage, while his death record suggests that his birth occurred about 1831. Browning's father was listed as William Browning (deceased), with his profession that of optician. John Browning's occupation was also listed as optician. In 1891, the year following their marriage, John and Annie Browning resided in Clapham, with his profession again recorded as optician. The Church of Holy Trinity, Clapham was added to the National Heritage List for England on 14 July 1955 as a Grade II* listed building.\n\n## Retirement and death  \nThe company of W. Watson & Son, opticians and camera makers, was founded in London in 1837. In 1900, that company took over John Browning & Co. From 1908, the latter company was known as Watson & Sons Ltd. By 1901, John Browning and his wife had moved to Bournemouth in Hampshire, and a one-year-old daughter Minnie was now part of the family. John Browning's occupation was listed as \"refractionist and optician (retired)\".  John Browning retired from his profession by 1905, and moved to Chislehurst on the outskirts of London, by some accounts. However, his obituary by the Royal Astronomical Society indicates that he retired to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He died in the registration district of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1925, with his death registered in the fourth quarter of the year. He was survived by his wife and his daughter, who was chief librarian at Bradford Library. Browning's widow Annie died on 18 February 1932 in Cheltenham.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about John Browning is supported by the provided images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Paleologus of Pesaro  \nThe Paleologus family (small|pl. Paleologi; Paleologo), also called Palaiologos, Palaeologus and Paleologue, were a noble family from Pesaro in Italy who later established themselves in England in the 17th century. They might have been late-surviving descendants of the Palaiologos dynasty, rulers of the Byzantine Empire from 1259/1261 to its fall in 1453.  \nMembers of the family claimed to be descendants of Thomas Palaiologos, a younger brother of the final Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos, though modern historians are divided on whether their line of descent is true. With the exception of a single figure in their purported genealogy, a son of Thomas by the name of John who is absent in contemporary sources, their claimed line of descent can be verified through documents at Pesaro. None of their contemporaries ever doubted their claims to imperial descent. If they were descendants of the Palaiologoi emperors, they were the last living members of the Palaiologos dynasty.  \nFor much of their early history in Pesaro, the members of the Paleologus family served the town's ruling Della Rovere family in a military capacity. After brothers Leonidas and Scipione Paleologus, together with their nephew Theodore, were arrested for attempted murder, the family was disgraced in Pesaro and Theodore was forced into exile. After working as a soldier and assassin, Theodore arrived in England in 1597 and eventually settled in Cornwall. He had several children, but only one of them, Ferdinand, who later settled in Barbados, is known to have had children of his own. The last known living member of the family, Godscall Paleologue, is last attested as a newborn baby in 1694 and her subsequent fate is unknown.  \n## Descent from the Palaiologos dynasty  \n### Background  \n<image>Thomas Palaiologos, detail from the Pintoricchio fresco of Pius II's arrival at Ancona, in the Siena Cathedral\nThe Palaiologos dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of the Byzantine Empire and one of the empire's longest ruling dynasties, ruling the empire from 1259/1261 to its fall in 1453. As the Byzantine Empire collapsed over the course of the 14th and 15th centuries due to internal strife and the aggressive expansion of the Ottoman Empire, many Byzantine nobles fled their crumbling empire, travelling to Western Europe. With the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the fall of the Despotate of the Morea, a Byzantine province, in 1460, the Palaiologoi were dispossessed. In November 1460, the highest-profile Byzantine exile of them all, Thomas Palaiologos, younger brother of the final emperor Constantine XI, arrived in Rome, hoping to convince Pope Pius II to call for a crusade so that the empire could be restored.  \nDespite the hopes of Thomas, no crusade would ever be called again and Constantinople remained in Turkish hands. He died in Rome and was survived by at least four children; Helena, Zoe, Andreas and Manuel. His daughters had many descendants, but none carried the Palaiologos name, and while the elder son Andreas is most often presumed to have been childless, Manuel had two children; John and another Andreas, who converted to Islam. John died young but Andreas lived longer, though is not believed to have had any children of his own. With his death at some point in the 16th century, the imperial line of the Palaiologoi would thus have been rendered extinct.  \nThis did little to stop individuals in various parts of Europe from claiming descent from the old imperial dynasty. The family name Palaiologos had been relatively widespread in the Byzantine Empire, and the family had been quite extensive before a branch of it acceded to the imperial throne. Many of the non-imperial Byzantine Palaiologoi were part of the nobility and served as generals or powerful landowners. Many Byzantine refugees, though unrelated to the emperors, legitimately bore the name Palaiologos due to the extensive nature of the family. Because the name could lend whoever bore it prestige (as well as possible monetary support), many refugees fabricated closer links to the imperial dynasty and were because of this welcomed at courts in Western Europe since many Western rulers were conscious of their failure to prevent Byzantium's fall. It would have helped that many in Western Europe would have been unaware of the intricacies of Byzantine naming customs; to Western Europeans, the name Palaiologos meant the imperial dynasty.\n\n### Existence of John Palaiologos  \n<image>left\nThe Paleologus family, attested as living in Pesaro, Italy, from the early 16th century onwards, claimed descent from a third son of Thomas Palaiologos, called John. As of yet, there is no independent evidence that Thomas had a son by the name John (or indeed that this John actually existed). The most widely accepted source on the life of Thomas Palaiologos, the works of contemporary Byzantine historian George Sphrantzes, mentions all the other four children but fails to mention John. Sphrantzes's works are not unquestionable, however. It appears that much of it was rewritten by an editor at a later date and the timeline the works provide is somewhat questionable, having Thomas's wife Catherine give birth to one of their children at the age of 65.  \nThe earliest source unrelated to the Paleologi of Pesaro themselves that mentions a son of Thomas by the name John is the writings of the Greek scholar Leo Allatius. Allatius wrote in 1648, too late for his works to act as independent evidence for the descent of the Paleologus family, but he was the keeper of the Vatican Library and would have had access to its vast collection of books and records and might have deduced his findings from there. It is possible that Allatius had access to earlier documents, now lost, which would have proven the legitimacy of the Paleologus line. Allatius gives the sons of Thomas as \"Andrea, Manuele and Ioanne\". It would be difficult to explain why Allatius, a respected and famous scholar, would simply fabricate a member of the imperial dynasty.  \nIt is possible that John is a later corruption of the name Leone (the names are similar in their Latin form, John being rendered as Ioannes and Leone being rendered as Leonis) and there are some references to a Leone Palaiologos in Pesaro, notably a 1535 document which speaks of the “long and faithful service of Leone Palaiologos to the papal captain Giovanni della Rovere”. Assuming that a “long and faithful” service means at least a few decades, Leone would have entered Giovanni's service in a time when Thomas's arrival to Italy would have been in recent memory and it would have been very difficult to fake kinship with him. John could thus have been a real historical figure and a genuine son of Thomas Palaiologos, possibly illegitimate. It is also possible that John was a son of either one of Thomas's historically verified sons, Andreas or Manuel (who actually had a son by that name). If the existence of John is accepted, in some form, there is little reason to doubt the descent of the Paleologi in Pesaro. The members of the family probably believed it themselves and by the time they arrived in England, none of their contemporaries doubted their imperial descent. This acceptance stands in contrast to the fates of other would-be Palaiologoi in the 17th century, such as a \"Theodore Palaeologus\" who lived in Prague in 1603, who were convicted as forgers for their supposed claims.  \nThe lineage of the Paleologus family remained unquestioned until modern times. Tradition has it that during the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829), over a century after the Paleologi disappeared from history, a delegation was sent by the provisional government in Athens to find living descendants of the old imperial family. The delegation visited places in Italy where Palaiologoi were known to have resided and even came to Cornwall, where Theodore Paleologus had lived in the 17th century. Local tradition on Barbados has it that the delegation also sent a letter to the authorities on Barbados, inquiring if descendants of Ferdinand Paleologus still lived on the island. The letter supposedly requested that if that was the case, the head of the family should be provided with the means of returning to Greece, with the trip paid for by the Greek government. Ultimately, the delegation's search was in vain and they found no living embodiments of their lost empire. The 19th-century English priest Arthur Penrhyn Stanley claimed that the delegation had intended to make the head of the family, had one been found, into the sovereign of Greece. English historian William Henry Hamilton Rogers wrote in 1890 in regards to this possibility, \"how strange would have been the circumstance had such an undoubted descendant been discovered, and the imperial eagle arisen like a phoenix from the ashes of time, and strove to consolidate the shifting fortunes of this heroic and struggling people\".  \nAn article from 11 May 1913 in The San Francisco Call, titled Find in England, Traces of Dynasty, Once Ruled the World, identified the Paleologus family as \"by descent rightful rulers of the empire of the east\" and stated that there may yet be more research to be done in an attempt to track down potential descendants of the family \"if fortune's whirligig should bring about circumstances requiring that the hereditary emperor of the east should be sought out to reign once more in Constantinople\". As late as 1940, English historian Sir Stanley Casson described Theodore Paleologus, the family's most famous member, as the \"last recorded heir to Byzantium\".  \nBeginning with English historian Steven Runciman's 1965 book The Fall of Constantinople, in which the double-headed eagle on the tombstone of Theodore is described as having \"no business to be there\", a number modern scholars have dismissed the later Paleologi as impostors, mainly on account of the lack of evidence for John's existence. English historian Jonathan Harris commented that the precise genealogy presented on the tombstone is \"almost certainly incorrect\". Some, such as English byzantinist Donald Nicol, simply maintained that their claim to descend from Thomas Palaiologos are unproven, whereas others, such as English historians John Julius Norwich and Richard Jenkyns, considered it plausible that they were the last true descendants of the Palaiologos dynasty.1995 John Hall, author of a 2015 biography of Theodore Paleologus, questioned if it was really important whether the Paleologi of Pesaro were true imperial descendants or not but nevertheless concluded that it was likely that they were, noting that he believed John Palaiologos to have been an illegitimate son of Thomas Palaiologos.\n\n## History  \n### In Pesaro  \n<image>Miniature painting depicting Pesaro in 1578\nWith the critical exception of John Palaiologos, the existence of other ancestors claimed by the later members of the Paleologus family can be verified through records at Pesaro. John's supposed son, Theodore, and grandson, Prosper, have been proven to be real historical figures. Prosper is documented as one of Pesaro's most prominent nobles in 1537 and is recorded as having been alive as late as 1580. Both Theodore and Prosper served Pesaro's ruling family, the Della Rovere family, in a military capacity. The records at Pesaro also prove the existence of a younger brother of Prosper, Guidobaldo Paleologus, who served as Capitan dei Porto in Pesaro, attested as such in 1578.  \nProsper had three known sons; Camilio (of which next to nothing is known), Leonidas and Scipione. In 1578, Leonidas and Scipione lived together with Camilio's young son, Theodore, and found themselves embroiled in a scandal as they were convicted for the attempted murder of Leone Ramusciatti, a man who was also originally of Greek descent. Having failed to kill Leone, the three Paleologi had barricaded themselves in a church in an attempt to avoid arrest. Documentation from Pesaro refer to the three as a something akin to a gang and allude to a previous (successful) murder conducted by them. The fate of Scipione is unknown, but Leonidas was executed. Theodore, who is referred to as a minor (he was probably 16–18 years old) was spared the death penalty and instead banished not only from Pesaro, but from the entire Duchy of Urbino.\n\n### In England and elsewhere  \n<image>left\nAfter being exiled, Theodore is next attested upon his arrival to England in 1597, there to kill a man named Alessandro Antelminelli, wanted by the authorities of the Republic of Lucca. At this point, Theodore had established himself as an assassin, and seems to have had an impressive reputation. Ultimately, Theodore failed to kill Antelminelli, and perhaps because he wanted a safer and more stable profession (he was around 40 years old), he stayed in England for the rest of his life, first entering into the service of Henry Clinton, the Earl of Lincoln. Clinton was almost sixty years old and one of the most brutal, feared and hated feudal lords in Britain. Clinton is frequently described as waging war on his neighbors and is often credited with rioting, abduction, arson, sabotage, extortion and perjury. At one point, Clinton even expanded his castle walls into the nearby churchyard.  \nWhile in Clinton's service, Theodore met his wife, Mary Balls, with whom he had six, possibly seven, children. When Clinton died in 1616, the fate of the family is unknown, but they were no longer present at the Earl's seat in Tattershall. Three years later, Theodore, Mary and some of the children lived in Plymouth, where Theodore in 1628 attempted to enter into the service of George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, who was almost as hated in England as the Earl of Lincoln had been. Villiers was assassinated soon thereafter, however, and Theodore was instead invited to stay with Sir Nicholas Lower, a rich Cornish squire, at his home in Landulph, Cornwall, called Clifton Hall. Clifton Hall was divided as to give place to two families, and Theodore was joined by his wife and some of his children.  \nWhen Theodore died in 1636, the family seemed to be well-off. He was survived by five of his children; the two daughters Dorothy and Mary and the three sons Theodore Junior, John and Ferdinand. Of the two daughters, only Dorothy married and she probably never had children. The fates of the three brothers were caught up in the English Civil War of 1642–1651. Theodore Junior supported the Roundheads, who meant to end absolute monarchy in Britain, and did not survive the war, probably dying of camp fever during the early stages of the long Siege of Oxford. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his grave still remains. The other two brothers were Cavaliers, or royalists, and fled the country during the war.  \nBoth Ferdinand and John were in Barbados, among the first colonists on the island, in 1644. John disappears from history soon thereafter, but Ferdinand stayed on the island for the rest of his life, becoming known there as the \"Greek prince from Cornwall\". He quickly became one of the elite on the island, cultivating cotton or sugar and possibly pineapples and was highly influential in the affairs of the local St. John's Parish Church. He constructed a great mansion called Clifton Hall, named after the family's home in Cornwall, which stands on the island to this day, recognized as one of the oldest and grandest great houses in Barbados.  \nFerdinand had only one known child, his son Theodore, who soon left Barbados, returning to England and becoming a privateer. He lived in Stepney, London and died at sea near A Coruña, Spain in 1693. The only surviving child of Theodore, and the last known member of the family overall, was Theodore's posthumous daughter Godscall Paleologue, born on 12 January 1694. There are no sources on Godscall beyond her baptismal records and her subsequent fate is unknown.1995\n\n## Heraldry  \n<image>Coat of arms of Theodore Paleologus, as presented on his tombstone\nHeraldry in a West-European sense, permanent motifs transmitted through hereditary right, was never adopted in the Byzantine Empire. During the last few centuries of the empire's existence, a double-headed eagle symbol was increasingly associated with imperial power, with senior members of the Palaiologos dynasty typically using it as a personal symbol. The only preserved illustration of a coat of arms of the Paleologi of Pesaro is the depiction of one on the tombstone of Theodore Paleologus in Landulph, Cornwall. Theodore's coat of arms prominently displays a double-headed eagle, harkening back to the old emperors, but also incorporates two towers, the meaning of which is unknown. John Hall believes the towers to represent the gates of Rome and Constantinople. Above the double-headed eagle is an imperial crown.  \nThe arms on the tombstone also features a small crescent at the bottom. In English heraldry, such a crescent denotes someone as a second son, meaning that it is possible that Theodore had an older brother, but no older son of Camilio Paleologus is known. It is possible that the crescent was mistakenly added by Nicholas Lower, who commissioned the tombstone after Theodore's death.  \nThe shield on the tombstone is divided into two sections by a line behind the double-headed eagle, which indicates that it would have had two background colors. Since the tombstone itself is colorless, what these colors were is unknown. Hall believes that the colors may have been red and white, since these colors were prominently used by the Palaiologoi emperors.\n\n## Family tree  \nFollows Hall (2015).\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the Paleologus family and their claims of descent from the Byzantine imperial dynasty?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Effects of Hurricane Irma in the British Virgin Islands  \nThe effects of Hurricane Irma in the British Virgin Islands were significant in terms of both human and socio-economic impact on the Territory. Hurricane Irma struck the British Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane during the daylight hours of Wednesday, 6 September 2017. It caused widespread destruction, and killed a total of four people. The eye of the hurricane traveled over the three major islands in the group: Virgin Gorda, Tortola and Jost Van Dyke.  \nThe hurricane caused extensive damage to property and infrastructure in the Territory, and caused statistically significant levels of depopulation.  \nThe Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn in a few days previously, declared a state of emergency under the Territory's constitution, the first time this had ever happened. As radio facilities had been significantly damaged and were inoperable, the state of emergency had to be announced by distribution of flyers around the capital, Road Town.  \n## Preparations  \nFrom a relatively early stage of its development, Hurricane Irma was predicted to travel close to, or over, the British Virgin Islands. However, the late stage intensification of the storm was less well anticipated. As little as two days before the storm struck, the BVI Department of Disaster Management were predicting maximum expected wind speed of abbr=on - on the boundary between a Category 2 and Category 3 hurricane. Over the course of 5 September 2017 Hurricane Irma rapidly intensified until it had strengthened well beyond sustained wind speeds required for classification as a Category 5 hurricane, into the strongest hurricane ever recorded over the open Atlantic Ocean (excluding the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea).  \nOn 5 September 2017 the hurricane's track was predicted to take it directly over the northernmost island in the Territory, Anegada. During the last 24 hours before the storm struck its tracked moved slightly southward so that the centre of the hurricane travelled directly through the middle of the islands.  \nThe Government recommended a full evacuation of Anegada, as the highest elevation on that island is just 25 feet - lower than the predicted storm surge - and the hurricane was expected to pass directly over it. Government provided an evacuation ferry, although not all residents did leave. Ironically, because of the storm's late southward turn, Anegada was spared the worst of the weather.  \n## 6 September 2017  \nAt approximately 4.30am local time public electricity was switched off. Standard operating procedure for the British Virgin Islands Electricity Corporation is to shut off power once the majority of the Territory is experiencing tropical storm force winds. By approximately 9.30am the majority of the country was experiencing hurricane-force winds. By the time the storm hit the British Virgin Islands, it had intensified to such a level as to be detected on seismometers calibrated for earthquakes. The eye of the hurricane traversed the Territory between around 1.00 and 2.30 pm. By the early evening wind speeds had fallen once again to sub-hurricane speeds, although tropical storm force winds continued until the small hours of the following morning.  \nA series of public alert messages sent in SMS form by the Department of Disaster of Management throughout the day, and were recorded in The Irma Diaries, a book recording experiences of survivors from the storm and its aftermath. At 5.39am a message was sent:  \nThe last message from the DDM which was sent before total communications failure was sent at 11.34am read:  \nNo further communications were sent. It would later transpire that the offices of the Department of Disaster Management were almost entirely destroyed during the storm.  \nIn the aftermath of the storm a large proportion of the Territory's roads were impassable. Communities were essentially cut-off from each other and the wider world. Telecommunications was rendered virtually non-existent by the destruction of the cellular telephone network and the almost total loss of telephone poles for landlines.  \n## Deaths  \nFour people died in the Territory as a result of the hurricane. Their names were Charles Thomas, Derek Ragnauth, Xavier 'Dag' Samuels and Richard Alan Benson.  \nDag Samuels was a well known athletics coach in the Territory. His protégé, Kyron McMaster, would go on to win gold in the 400m hurdles in the 2018 Commonwealth Games the following year, and would dedicate his victory to his deceased coach.  \nThe Territory also experienced an abnormally high number of deaths in the months of September to December 2017, after the passage of the hurricane.  \n## Damage  \nSatellite imagery before and after the passing of Hurricane Irma, showing the \"browning\" of the landscape denuded of vegetation.  \nThe most significant damage was on Tortola. The UK's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson visited Tortola on 13 September 2017 and said that he was reminded of photos of Hiroshima after it had been hit by the atom bomb. Real estate investor Joe Chapman said of the hurricane that it was, \"incredibly devastating to have your properties damaged..but not only that, the country was destroyed.\" Approximately 85% of housing stock - over 4,000 homes - were damaged or destroyed. Numerous contemporaneous reports referred to the \"browning\" of the island, and the bark being stripped from trees.  \nAfter the storm, authorities estimated that it would take 6 months to restore public electricity to the entire country; an estimate which proved largely accurate.  \n<image>Main Street, Road Town in the days after Hurricane Irma.\n\n<image>Devastation of the island of Jost Van Dyke after hurricane Irma.\nAvailability of food, potable water, fuel and medicine were highly limited. Residents had to queue, sometimes for hours, in the sun to obtain necessities. None of the banks functioned for several days afterwards, and the Territory became a purely cash economy for a period of weeks.\n\n### Homeless  \nOnly 279 people were recorded as being provided emergency accommodation by the Government in the immediate aftermath. Although some unofficial estimates were higher, it was still a relatively small fraction of the overall population. Many of the surviving private dwellings were used to accommodate multiple families, which may have assisted the pressure on providing emergency accommodation.  \n### Balsam Ghut prison  \nFollowing the hurricane there was extensive damage to the prison, 90% of the buildings were damaged, most had lost their roofs and the perimeter fence was breached at several points. Prisoners eventually forced their way out, some returning that day. Although exact numbers were never provided, the authorities indicated that a number of the prisoners surrendered themselves voluntarily after checking on their families. All except two of the remaining prisoners were subsequently recaptured over the following days. Joint operations by both UK and local police assisted by the Royal Marines secured the prison and returned the vast majority of prisoners within seven days.  \n### High school  \nIrma damaged the Elmore Stoutt High School building, so students had to move to the former Clarence Thomas Ltd building in Pasea Estate. The students were divided into two shifts as the temporary building is not big enough to accommodate the students at the same time. Students in the morning shift are to go to after school programmes to keep themselves occupied.  \n### Department of Disaster Management  \nThe building which housed the Department of Disaster Management was almost totally destroyed in the storm. Accordingly, the relief and recovery efforts had to be coordinated from a conference room in Peebles Hospital.  \n### Looting  \nIn the days after the hurricane there were reports of looting of local businesses. This included not just food and medical supplies, but also non-essential consumer goods. The looting was brought under control when British troops arrived as part of the relief supplies.  \n## Subsequent weather events  \nFour days after Hurricane Irma passed, Hurricane Jose, a Category 4 hurricane, narrowly missed the islands.  \nEight days after Hurricane Irma passed, the Territory experienced torrential downpours of rain. Because the hills had been stripped of vegetation by the hurricane, this resulted almost immediately in extensive flooding of low-lying areas, including the capital, Road Town.  \n<image>The flooding of Road Town the week after Hurricane Irma.\nFourteen days after Hurricane Irma, the Territory was struck again by Hurricane Maria, also a Category 5 hurricane. However the eye of the storm passed to the south of Saint Croix, and the damage was minimal compared to Hurricane Irma.\n\n## Relief efforts  \nBy 8 September 2017, the UK government sent troops with medical supplies and other aid. The arrival of HMS Ocean, carrying more extensive assistance, was delayed and did not arrive for approximately two weeks.  \n<image>Royal Marines delivering aid on Jost Van Dyke.\nAfter the hurricane passed, entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, a resident of Necker Island, called on the UK government to develop a massive disaster recovery plan for British islands that were damaged, including \"both through short-term aid and long-term infrastructure spending.\" Premier Orlando Smith also called for a comprehensive aid package to rebuild the BVI. On 10 September, British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged £32 million to the Caribbean region generally for a Hurricane relief fund.  \nAid distribution centres were set up in Cane Garden Bay, East End and Hunthum's Ghut.\n\n### Evacuations  \nIt took several days before Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport reopened for non-military traffic after the passage of the hurricane. Although it was only lightly damaged, communications equipment was destroyed, and the runway needed to be inspected and secured before allowing flight operations. In the seven days after it was reopened, a total of 1,597 (or approximately 5% of the population) was evacuated by airlift. The number of persons who evacuated by helicopter from private sites or by boat is not recorded.  \n### Curfew  \nAlmost immediately after the passage of the hurricane a state of emergency was declared and the Governor imposed a curfew. After one month, rather than extend the state of emergency, the Government passed the Curfew Act, giving the elected Government power to impose a curfew, which they did immediately. That civilian curfew then ended after a period of three months (after being gradually relaxed by degrees) and so the Territory operated under curfew for a period of three-months.  \nThere are no reliable records of a curfew having been imposed in the Territory in modern times, and there was no legal basis upon which one could have been imposed (absent either legislation or a state of emergency). Therefore, this was likely the first curfew imposed in the British Virgin Islands since at least the colonial era.  \n## Recovery  \nThe estimated damage to property in the British Virgin Islands was initially calculated to be US$3.6 billion. Although there were widespread reports of economic distress and redundancies in the aftermath of the hurricane, no reliable statistics or projections have been published. In the Territory's 2018 annual budget address, the Minister of Finance reported a 46% decline in tourist arrivals, and projected a 9.3% decline in Government revenues, and a contraction of 2.6% in GDP.  \n### Depopulation  \n<image>A ruined house in Road Town, Tortola after Hurricane Irma.\nIn May 2018 the Immigration Department of the British Virgin Islands announced that the population of the Territory has dropped by approximately 11% since Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck the previous year.\n\n### Insurance  \n<image>Soper's Hole, West End, Tortola after Hurricane Irma.\nRecovery and rebuilding efforts in the Territory were hampered by low levels of insurance coverage. The Government itself had a policy of \"self-insurance\", and other than the Central Administration Complex, virtually none of its buildings or vehicles were insured.  \nPrivate homeowners also have relatively low levels of hurricane insurance. In previous natural disasters the Government has provided emergency assistance to residents, providing funding for repairs to homes that are uninsured. This created a moral hazard in that only uninsured homes were eligible for Government assistance, and incentivised lower income property owners to be underinsured or completely uninsured.  \nTo assist insured homeowners, the Government formed a temporary dedicated Insurance Tribunal to hear and determine insurance claims.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image shows the aftermath of Hurricane Irma where the Royal Marines are delivering aid?\nChoice list: \nA.

The series was expected to premiere on the upcoming Disney+ streaming service, which was still unnamed at the time. Tim Federle was approached by the company, and he pitched the documentary-style series in January 2018. He went on to draft the pilot together with Disney Channel, who contributed to the production of the series. The series is also produced by companies Chorus Boy and Salty Pictures. Federle was first reported to be serving as a writer and executive producer for the series in May 2018. In September, Disney officially gave the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. Oliver Goldstick was expected to serve as showrunner and an additional executive producer while Julie Ashton would oversee the casting process. Alongside this announcement, the show was described as a mockumentary, and a list of character names and descriptions was released. By May 2019, Goldstick had departed the series over \"creative differences\", having served as showrunner for the first four episodes. Nellie Andreeva of Deadline Hollywood attributed Goldstick's departure to him wanting to incorporate more mature themes in the series. Federle assumed the position of showrunner for the remainder of the first season.  \nIn October 2019, ahead of the release of the first season, Disney+ renewed the series for a second season. Federle stated that the second season's plot would not revolve around a production of High School Musical 2; in February 2020, the featured production was reported as Beauty and the Beast.  \nDisney+ renewed the series for a third season in September 2021. For its third season, the story is set at a sleep-away theater camp and takes place over the summer school break. It was teased in November that the featured production would be Frozen, which was confirmed in January 2022.  \nAhead of the third-season premiere, Disney+ renewed the series for a fourth season in May 2022. It was announced in September that the featured musical would be based on the film High School Musical 3: Senior Year. In the season, the students return to East High where the filming of a fictionalized film, High School Musical 4: The Reunion, takes place. It was reported in June 2023 that the series would end with its fourth season. Federle decided to end the series at a high point, midway through the production of the fourth season. He suggested that the series had reach a peak level of meta, and wanted to avoid a cliffhanger at the end of the season that might not get resolved if the series was later cancelled.  \n### Writing  \nFederle drew inspiration for the mockumentary style of the series from other films and programs such as Waiting for Guffman and The Office. He was inspired to create a series that depicted music as a central theme, while also drawing on his experience as a former Broadway performer.  \nThe series is inclusive of LGBT representation, three gay characters being featured: Carlos, Seb, and Maddox, as well as two bisexual characters: Ashlyn and Big Red. In an interview with The Advocate, Frankie Rodriguez credited Federle for writing his character Carlos as gay without drawing on the tropes of a typical queer character. The character Seb plays the role of Sharpay in the musical, an example of non-traditional gender casting. The series begins the exploration of a same-sex relationship when Carlos asks Seb to the school dance in the episode \"Homecoming\". Ashlyn and Big Red come out in the third season; Federle stated that this had been suggested by Julia Lester and Larry Saperstein since the first season. The series further depicts same-sex parenting through Nini's two mothers Carol and Dana. The show also includes themes such as divorce and anxiety.  \n### Casting  \nFederle commented on the importance of casting real teenagers in main roles to add authenticity to the high school-based series. Joshua Bassett was cast in the leading role of Ricky in October 2018. The remainder of the cast was made public in February 2019: Olivia Rodrigo as Nini, Kate Reinders as Miss Jenn, Sofia Wylie as Gina, Matt Cornett as E.J., Dara Reneé as Kourtney, Julia Lester as Ashlyn, Frankie Rodriguez as Carlos, Larry Saperstein as Big Red, and Mark St. Cyr as Mr. Mazzara. Federle confirmed in November 2019 that an unnamed cast member from the original film would make a cameo appearance through a fantasy sequence. After being listed as a featured artist on the soundtrack, Lucas Grabeel, who played Ryan Evans, was confirmed to be making an appearance on the series. Grabeel appears in the episode \"The Tech Rehearsal\" as a fictionalized version of himself, performing in a song alongside Reinders. Kaycee Stroh, who played Martha Cox, also makes a cameo appearance in the episode \"What Team?\".  \nIn December 2019, it was reported that Joe Serafini, who plays Seb Matthew-Smith, would be promoted to the main cast for the second season. Further additions to the recurring cast were revealed in early 2020: Roman Banks as Howie; Olivia Rose Keegan as Lily; and Derek Hough as Zack, Miss Jenn's ex-boyfriend. In February 2021, Andrew Barth Feldman and Asher Angel joined the cast for the second season in recurring guest roles, as Antoine and Jack respectively. That July, it was revealed that Jordan Fisher would guest star as Jamie Porter in the penultimate episode of the second season.  \n<image>Olivia Rodrigo, pictured in 2021, portrays Nini Salazar-Roberts throughout the series' first three seasons.\nTime reported in December 2021 that Rodrigo would return for the third season, amidst speculation that she would not due to the success of her solo music career. It was later stated that Rodrigo would return in a recurring role as opposed to the series regular status she maintained in the first two seasons; Federle confirmed that Rodrigo would exit the show after the third season. The casting for the third season was made public in January 2022; Bassett, Cornett, Wylie, Lester, Reneé, and Rodriguez were also confirmed to be returning. Saylor Bell Curda and Adrian Lyles joined the cast as new series regulars, playing Maddox and Jet respectively. Further additions to the guest cast included Jason Earles as Dewey Wood and Meg Donnelly as Val. Corbin Bleu, who starred in the original film series, was also announced as a guest, playing himself. Three further recurring characters were revealed in March: Ben Stillwell, Aria Brooks, and Liamani Segura as Channing, Alex and Emmy respectively. Saperstein, Reinders, Serafini, and Keegan were listed as guests for the third season in May 2022; it was stated that Mark St. Cyr would not return. Two additions to the guest cast were revealed the following month: JoJo Siwa as Madison and Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Marvin.  \nFederle stated in September 2022 that the fourth season would revolve around the characters Ricky, Gina, Ashlyn, Kourtney, and Carlos; it was later confirmed that Bassett, Wylie, Lester, Reneé, and Rodriguez would return. The casting announcement for the fourth season also revealed that Segura had been promoted to the main cast, and Reinders would return as a series regular. Federle confirmed that Rodrigo would not feature in the fourth season, but said that she could return to the series in the future. He said that he was in negotiations for original High School Musical cast members to star as guests in the season; it was announced that Bleu, Grabeel, and Stroh would return, joined by Monique Coleman, Bart Johnson and Alyson Reed, all playing themselves. Further additions to the recurring cast included Kylie Cantrall as Dani, Matthew Sato as Mack, Caitlin Reilly as Quinn, and Vashty Mompoint as Krystal.\n\n### Filming  \nProduction on the first season began on February 15, 2019, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Production on the second season commenced in February 2020, but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming had resumed by November 2020. Filming for the third season began in January 2022 and concluded in April 2022; production of the series relocated from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. Production returned to Salt Lake City for the filming of the fourth season, which ran from September to December 2022.  \nThe mockumentary style of the series is achieved through the single-camera setup, with handheld cameras used to create shaky footage and zooming. Talking heads are also used; the characters talk directly to the camera to express their inner thoughts. The scenes containing shaky footage and talking heads represent the \"present-day\" in the story; flashbacks to Nini and Ricky's past relationship are filmed more similarly to other teen drama series.  \n### Music  \nThe first season's soundtrack contains nine original songs, and one new composition featured in each episode. The majority of songs are performed live by the actors. Some actors played instruments such as a guitar in their performances. Rodrigo wrote an original song for the series, \"All I Want\", and co-wrote \"Just for a Moment\" with Bassett and music producer Dan Book. Federle stated that his original pitch included the idea of developing original songs for the series. Steve Vincent, who worked on the original films, served as the musical supervisor for the series and sourced several composers to write new music. He also received submissions from songwriters based in Los Angeles. The soundtrack for the first season, featuring new songs and renditions of songs from the original film, was released on January 10, 2020, by Walt Disney Records. In the lead-up to the release, selected tracks were made available weekly to correlate with the episodes being released.  \nAn album accompanying the holiday special, High School Musical: The Musical: The Holiday Special, was released on November 20, 2020, which includes Christmas music and selected songs as a preview of the second season. As well as both new songs and new versions of songs from the High School Musical franchise, the second season's soundtrack features songs from Beauty and the Beast, written by Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, and Tim Rice. Bassett and Rodrigo both wrote original songs for the second season. The season's soundtrack was released on July 30, 2021, which includes a cover of \"Home\" by Keegan. The third season's soundtrack features music from the Disney Channel television film Camp Rock as well as the High School Musical franchise and songs from the featured production Frozen. The first song, a cover of \"It's On\" from Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, was released as a preview on July 7, 2022, before the season's release. Bassett co-wrote and co-produced an original song, \"Finally Free\", for the season. Reneé also co-wrote a song for the season, titled \"Here I Come\", collaborating with songwriters Anthony M. Jones and Steph Jones. The song's lyrics were inspired by her experiences with anxiety. Music from High School Musical 3: Senior Year will feature in the fourth season, as well as original music. Federle stated that the season would see a return to songs being performed live by the actors within the episodes, which had not occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n## Release  \nThe first episode of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series was telecast on Disney Channel, ABC, and Freeform on November 8, 2019, ahead of its launch on the streaming service Disney+ on November 12, 2019, in 4K HDR. The preview simulcast of the first episode was viewed by 2.03million on ABC, in addition to 474,000 on Disney Channel and 293,000 during its Freeform airing. The broadcast received 2.8million viewers in total. On the streaming service, episodes were released weekly rather than the binge-watching model of all at once. The first-season finale was released on January 10, 2020. High School Musical: The Musical: The Holiday Special, featuring the cast performing Christmas music, was released December 11, 2020; the 45-minute special featured previews of songs and scenes from the second season. Before the release of the second season, Disney Channel aired the complete first season in a marathon format on May 8, 2021. The first season also airs on Disney Channel in Latin America. The second season premiered on May 14, 2021. The season was originally planned to debut in 2020 but was delayed after the COVID-19 pandemic halted filming. The third season premiered on July 27, 2022; episodes were released weekly. The fourth and final season premiered on August 9, 2023; all episodes were released at once.  \n## Reception  \n### Critical response  \nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 75% approval for the first season with an average rating of 7.38/10 based on 32 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though fans may find what they've been looking for in its nostalgic stylings, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series follows a little too closely in its predecessor's steps to truly be the start of something new.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 64 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" for the series as a whole.  \nCritics commented on the differences between the series and the film, and there was a mixed reaction to the mockumentary format. Vinnie Mancuso of Collider described the series as \"endearingly tongue-in-cheek\". Kelly Lawler indicated that the series is a \"love letter\" to high school theater productions in a review for USA Today. Joel Keller of Decider opined that viewing the series did not require an understanding of the original franchise; Caroline Framke of Variety considered some elements of the program too similar to the original film's \"two-dimensional\" approach. Insiders Libby Torres said the series lacked the \"infectious energy\" of the original film and found the premise jarring. Mancuso objected to the mockumentary style of the series, arguing that the format distracted from other humor in the episodes. /Films Ethan Anderton described the technique as \"inorganic and unnecessary\". Daniel Toy of Tom's Guide felt the talking heads helped avoid unfamiliarity with characters.  \nThe cast's music and dance performances have been commended by critics. Shannon Miller of The A.V. Club praised the cast's talent, in particular, Rodrigo and Bassett for their musical ability and \"handling of dramatic material\". Writing for Decider, Kayla Cobb stated that the two leads have significant romantic chemistry. Megan Peters of ComicBook.com praised Rodrigo for her portrayal of Nini's guarded personality, and Keller described her as \"especially magnetic\". Anderton also applauded the cast and suggested that the series does not feature the same \"exaggerated acting style\" as the source material. The show's choreography was commended, as well as Wylie for her dance capability. Toy noted Rodriguez's comedic timing in his portrayal of Carlos. Anderton, Peters, and Framke likened Kate Reinders's performance as the exuberant Miss Jenn to Kristin Chenoweth.  \nThe series has been likened to Glee for its themes, as well as its combination of music and drama. Framke described the series as a \"sweet and very silly version of Glee\", and Peters noted similarities through its \"quick cuts and quips\". Miller considered that High School Musical uses music more as a literal than the abstract element in the storyline. Reviewing the music, Mancuso and Toy expressed interest in the program continuing to provide new songs to complement the original film's soundtrack. Cobb commended the vocal abilities of the main cast and described Rodrigo as \"an especially pronounced talent\" with a sweet and sincere voice.  \n### Accolades\n\nQuestion: Which musical was NOT performed by the theater students of East High School as mentioned in the descriptions of the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

Christmas Island is the summit plateau of an underwater volcano. It is mostly clad in tropical rainforest and has karst, cliffs, wetlands, coasts and sea. It is a small island with a land area of abbr=on, 63% of which has been declared a National park. Most of the rainforest remains intact and supports a large range of endemic species of animals and plants.\n\n## Geography  \nTopography of Christmas Island  \nThe island is about mi long and abbr=on wide. The total land area is sqmi, with abbr=on of coastline. The island is the flat summit of an underwater volcano more than abbr=on high, with about abbr=on being submerged and only about abbr=on above the surface. Some basalt is exposed in places but most of the surface rock is limestone accumulated from coral growth. The karst terrain supports numerous anchialine pools. Steep cliffs along much of the coast rise abruptly to a central plateau. The island is mainly covered by tropical rainforest, much of which remains intact. Two thirds of the island is included in the Christmas Island National Park which includes rainforests, wetlands, cliffs, shore and coral reefs.  \nThe climate is tropical and temperatures vary little throughout the year. The highest temperature of around F usually occurs  in March and April, while the lowest temperature is around F in August. There is a dry season from July to October with only occasional showers. The wet season is between November and June, and includes monsoons and occasional tropical cyclones.  \n## Flora  \n<image>Tahitian chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer)\nAbout 213 species of vascular plant are native to the island, with sixteen of them endemic. The rainforest on the upper slopes and central plateau consists of large evergreen trees with a canopy at abbr=on and a scattering of emergent trees some abbr=on high. The dominant trees are Planchonella duclitan, Syzygium nervosum, Tristiropsis acutangula, Inocarpus fagifer and Hernandia ovigera. Mid-storey species include two endemic trees, the Christmas Island palm, Arenga listeri and the screw pine Pandanus elatus. There are few shrubs, but the trunks and branches of the trees are swathed in a tangle of vines, orchids and ferns.  \nOn terraces lower down the cliffs the trees are shorter, reaching abbr=on. Here the dominant species are Pisonia grandis, Gyrocarpus americanus, Gyrocarpus americanus, Terminalia catappa and Erythrina variegata. Various shrubs grow at the foot of the cliffs and on the coastal flats, sometimes in dense thickets. These include the endemic Pandanus christmatensis and Abutilon listeri, as well as certain shrubs and trees whose buoyant seeds are dispersed across the sea such as Scaevola taccada, Cordia subcordata, Morinda citrifolia, Hibiscus tiliaceus and Guettarda speciosa.\n\n## Fauna  \nChristmas Island was uninhabited until the end of the nineteenth century. The island possesses no large native, terrestrial mammals and the endemic mammal fauna of the island has been largely destroyed by the introduction of exotic species such as cats, dogs and black rats (Rattus rattus). The diurnal bulldog rat (Rattus nativitatis) and the nocturnal Maclear's rat (Rattus macleari) both became extinct after the accidental introduction of the black rat. The Christmas Island shrew (Crocidura trichura) may also be extinct, and the Christmas Island pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi) has not been seen since 2009. The Christmas Island flying fox (Pteropus melanotus natalis), the only other endemic mammal, is declining in numbers and is considered threatened.  \nChristmas Island red crab  \nRather than mammals, it is crabs that dominate the fauna. There are at least 50 species on the island, some of them endemic, 30 of them terrestrial species whose only link with the ocean is the necessity to travel to the sea to breed. Several are small and inconspicuous, but others such as the coconut crab and Christmas Island red crab are large and present in enormous numbers. In the late twentieth century there were estimated to be about 120 million red crabs on the island, and the mass migration made by the mature individuals to the coast was spectacular. The red crabs are a keystone species, feeding on the forest floor on leaves, fallen fruits, flowers, seedlings and carrion and maintaining a lawn-like turf. In the twenty-first century the number of red crabs has reduced considerably because of the accidental introduction of the yellow crazy ant to the island; this invasive species has formed supercolonies, killed crabs and had a profound impact on the biodiversity of the island.  \nThe karst limestone areas are riddled with caves and sink-holes, some of the underground water-filled cavities being saline. These underground habitats have been imperfectly sampled, but at least twelve endemic subterranean invertebrates are known including some such as ostracods, the cave shrimp Procaris noelensis and a blind cave scorpion Hormurus polisorum, that may be relicts from the Mesozoic fauna of the Tethys Ocean. The island is fringed by coral reefs and nearly seven hundred species of marine fish have been recorded in the surrounding waters as well as three species of marine turtle and about a dozen species of whales and dolphins.  \nChristmas Island is recognised by BirdLife International as being an Important Bird Area, mostly because of the breeding populations of seabirds. These include the red-footed booby, which nests in colonies in bushes and trees, the brown booby, which nests on cliffs, and the endemic Abbott's booby which nests on tall, emergent trees. Another endemic bird, the Christmas frigatebird, nests on the shore terraces, and the great frigatebird nests in semi-deciduous trees nearby. The brown noddy and two species of tropicbird also nest on the island. Land birds include four endemic species, the Christmas thrush, the Christmas imperial pigeon, the Christmas white-eye and the Christmas Island hawk-owl, and several endemic sub-species. Over a hundred migrants and vagrant species of bird have been recorded on the island.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

The most famous modern ferries are those which carry people and goods across the Straits of Mackinac to the car-free Mackinac Island but before the Mackinac Bridge was built, large numbers of ferries carried people and cars between the two peninsulas. Other ferries continue to provide transportation to small islands and across the Detroit River to Canada. Ferries once provided transport to island parks for city dwellers. The state's only national park, Isle Royale cannot be reached by road and is normally accessed by ferry. The largest ferries in Michigan are the car ferries which cross Lake Michigan to Wisconsin. One of these, the SS Badger is one of the last remaining coal steamers on the Great Lakes and serves as a section of US Highway 10 (US 10). The Badger is also the largest ferry in Michigan, capable of carrying 600 passengers and 180 autos.  \nAs of 2018, there are 18 ferry routes in Michigan, 13 of which have ferries which can carry vehicles. Three ferry routes cross the international border between U.S. and Canada. Ferry trips can be as short as a few minutes crossing a river to as long as seven hours crossing Lake Superior. These routes are all closed in the winter when the rivers and lakes are iced over. Winter closures can be as long as four months a year. Four passenger-only ferry destinations are islands without private vehicles and, in some cases, without even roads. One unique human-powered ferry takes passengers across the Kalamazoo River to a park with a Lake Michigan beach.  \nIn the early days of lake transport, it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between ferries, package freighters carrying passengers, and passenger liners on regular routes. The lakes and rivers often provided an easier route of travel than primitive or non-existent roads. Rail ferries would carry passenger trains and their occupants as well as freight cars, and later sometimes carried automobiles as well. Several of the busiest ferry routes were replaced by bridges or tunnels: Detroit to Windsor, Belle Isle, the Sault Ste. Maries, St. Ignace to Mackinaw City, Port Huron to Sarnia. Boblo ceased to be a destination with the closure of the amusement park. Changes in laws and industry lead to the end of the Lake Michigan railroad ferries.  \nThe first autos crossed the Straits of Mackinac in 1917 on the SS Chief Wawatam. In 1923, the state of Michigan began an auto ferry service that was the first such system to be state-owned. It continued until the day the Mackinac Bridge opened. The law required the ferry service to cease so that the bridge would not have competition and could pay off its construction bonds faster. The passenger ferries and many of the rail ferries across the Detroit and St. Clair rivers had ended after the bridges and tunnels were built.  \nThe ferries pioneered concepts in ship design and icebreaking techniques. Bow propellers and steel spoon-shaped bows made the rail ferries the best icebreakers on the lakes for many years until the dedicated U.S. Coast Guard icebreakers were assigned during World War II. In contrast, the ferries later had some of the most outdated equipment on the Lakes. The Badger, still in service in 2019, is the last coal-fired Great Lakes passenger steamer. The Chief Wawatam was the last hand-fed coal steamer and the Landsdowne was the last paddlewheeler when it was converted to a barge in 1970.  \nThe Detroit-Windsor ferries were popular with small-scale bootleggers during Prohibition, especially as border guards were reluctant to search young Canadian women who worked in Detroit offices.\n\n## Automobile ferries  \nLake Express at dock  \n### Lake Charlevoix  \n* Charlevoix At Ironton, Michigan is a four-car cable ferry that crosses a narrow point on the South Arm of Lake Charlevoix in the U.S. Located on Ferry Road off Michigan Route 66.  \n### Lake Michigan  \n#### Cross-lake  \n* SS Badger, cross-lake, Ludington, Michigan to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, connecting US Highway 10 (US 10) with its counterpart in Wisconsin, 4 hours  \n* HSC Lake Express, cross-lake, Muskegon, Michigan to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 2.5 hours  \nPostcard illustration of sinking ferry 18, with ferry 17 coming to its aid.1910  \n#### Beaver Island  \nCurrent boats  \n* Beaver Islander, (built 1962), Charlevoix, Michigan to Beaver Island, 2 hours  \n* Emerald Isle, (built 1997), Charlevoix to Beaver Island, 2 hours  \nRetired boats  \n* Emerald Isle (built 1955), in use 1955–62, then a Mackinac ferry until 1982, now Diamond Jack cruise on the Detroit River  \n* South Shore, (built 1945), for Miller Boat Line, Put-in-Bay, Ohio.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Mafia state  \nIn politics, a mafia state or pakhanate is a state system where the government is tied with organized crime to the degree when government officials, the police, and/or military became a part of the criminal enterprise. According to US diplomats, the expression \"mafia state\" was coined by Alexander Litvinenko.  \n## Particular applications of the concept  \n### Mafia in Italy and Yakuza in Japan  \ndate=January 2022<image>Giulio Andreotti, seven-time Prime Minister of Italy, was charged with having links to the Mafia.\nIn a critical review of Moisés Naím's essay in Foreign Affairs, Peter Andreas pointed to the long existence of Italian mafia and Japanese Yakuza, writing that there were close relationships between those illicit organisations and respective governments. According to Andreas, these examples speak against incidences of mafia states as a historically new threat.  \nIn Italy, three main mafia organisations originated in the 19th century: the Cosa Nostra originating from the region of Sicily, the Camorra originating from the region of Campania, and the 'Ndrangheta originating from the region of Calabria.  \nFormer Prime Minister of Italy, Giulio Andreotti, had legal action against him, with a trial for mafia association on 27 March 1993 in the city of Palermo. The prosecution accused the former prime minister of \"making available to the mafia association named Cosa Nostra for the defense of its interests and attainment of its criminal goals, the influence and power coming from his position as the leader of a political faction\".  Prosecutors said in return for electoral support of Salvo Lima and assassination of Andreotti's enemies, he had agreed to protect the Mafia, which had expected him to fix the Maxi Trial. Andreotti's defense was predicated on character attacks against the prosecution's key witnesses, who were themselves involved with the mafia. Andreotti was acquitted on 23 October 1999. However, together with the greater series of corruption cases of Mani pulite, Andreotti's trials marked the purging and renewal of Italy's political system.  \nThe Camorra Casalesi clan rose in the 1980s, gaining control of large areas of the local economy \"partly by manipulating politicians and intimidating judges\". The clan was heavily involved in the Naples waste management crisis that dumped toxic waste around Campania in the 1990s and 2000s; the boss of the clan, Gaetano Vassallo, admitted to systematically working for 20 years to bribe local politicians and officials to gain their acquiescence to dumping toxic waste.\n\n### Countries described as mafia states  \n#### Republics, mobs and territories of the former Yugoslavia  \n<image>Montenegro's former president Milo Đukanović is often described as having strong links to Montenegrin mafia.\nKosovo, a partially recognised independent state formerly part of Serbia, was called a \"mafia state\" by Italian MEP Pino Arlacchi in 2011, and also by Moisés Naím in his 2012 essay \"Mafia States\" in Foreign Affairs. Naím pointed out that Prime Minister of Kosovo Hashim Thaçi is allegedly connected to the heroin trade. Many other crime allegations have been made and investigated by several countries against Thaçi.  \nNaím also labeled Montenegro as a \"mafia state\" in the same essay, describing it as a hub for cigarette smuggling.\n\n#### Transnistria  \nTransnistria, an unrecognised break-away state from Moldova, has long been described by journalists, researchers, politicians and diplomats as a quasi-state whose economy is dependent on contraband and gunrunning, with some having directly referred to Transnistria as a mafia state.  \nFor instance, in 2002, Moldova's president, Vladimir Voronin, called Transnistria a \"residence of international mafia\", \"smuggling stronghold\", and \"outpost of Islamic combatants\". Attempts of customs blockade followed the allegations. Reacting to the allegations, Russian state-run RTR aired an investigative program revealing that Transnistrian firms were conducting industrial-level manufacturing of small arms purposely for subsequent illegal trafficking via the Ukrainian port of Odesa. According to the program, the trade was controlled by and benefited from Transnistria's founder and then-ruler Igor Smirnov.  \nHowever, more recent investigations and monitoring missions did not prove continuity in arms trafficking concerns. According to regular reports of the European Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM), there have been no signs of significant weapons smuggling from Transnistria. During the press conference on 30 November 2006, head of EUBAM Ferenc Banfi officially stated that organised smuggling of weapons in Transnistria did not exist. In 2013, Ukrainian Foreign Minister and acting chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Leonid Kozhara gave an interview to El País, commenting on the situation in Transnistria and results of work of the EUBAM mission. According to Kozhara, there have been no cases of arms traffic found.  \nSome experts from Russia and Transnistria state that allegations of Transnistria being a \"mafia state\", \"black hole of Europe\", and \"heaven for arms trafficking\", etc. are a carefully planned defamation campaign paid by the Moldovan government and aimed at producing a negative image of Transnistria. Officials from the European Union and the OSCE say they have no evidence that the Tiraspol regime has ever trafficked arms or nuclear material. Much of the alarm is attributed to efforts by the Moldovan government to increase pressure on Transnistria.  \n#### Russia  \nThe term has been used by slain Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko and media to describe the political system in Russia under Vladimir Putin's rule. This characterization came to prominence following the United States diplomatic cables leak, which revealed that US diplomats viewed Russia as \"a corrupt, autocratic kleptocracy centred on the leadership of Vladimir Putin, in which officials, oligarchs and organised crime are bound together to create a 'virtual mafia state.'\" In his book titled Mafia State, journalist and author Luke Harding argues that Putin has \"created a state peopled by ex-KGB and FSB officers, like himself, who are bent on making money above all.\" In the estimation of American diplomats, \"the government of Russia effectively is the mafia.\" Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen has also described Russia as a \"mafia state\".  \nAccording to the New Statesman, \"the term had entered the lexicon of expert discussion\" several years before the cables leak, \"and not as a frivolous metaphor. Those most familiar with the country had come to see it as a kleptocracy with Vladimir Putin in the role of capo di tutti capi, dividing the spoils and preventing turf wars between rival clans of an essentially criminal elite.\" In 2008, Stephen Blank noted that Russia under Putin is \"a state that European officials privately call a Mafia state\" that \"naturally gravitates toward Mafia-like behavior.\"  \nNikolay Petrov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, said \"it's pretty hard to damage the Russian image in the world because it's already not very good\".  \n#### Syria  \nFor more than half a century, Syria has been under the tight grip of the Assad dynasty, and its ruling system has been described as a mafia state. Due to the Syrian economy being dominated by business people tied to Assad family, control of various services like electricity by loyalist warlords, etc. more than 90% of Syrians live in poverty. The regime also profits from a multi-billion dollar captagon industry, made of a network consisting of over 35 manufacturing centres and factories, known as the \"Syndicate\" (Niqabeh). Assad's wife Asma stripped the assets of pro-Assad billionaire Rami Makhlouf and subsequently took control of all foreign charities and UN aid money; enabling the Assads to own revenue money directly. The fall of Rami Makhlouf led to widespread characterisations of Assad acting as a crime boss presiding over \"a crime syndicate simply designed to enrich himself and his family\", deploying violence to advance the interests of his mafia. Businessman Ribal al-Assad, a cousin of Bashar al-Assad who lives in exile outlines the situation: \"When it's all boiled down, the family is still in charge.. They are very sensitive to internal issues and they know how to manage them. They have a saying: \"You may not have to listen to your cousins, but you do need to listen to their mothers.\"  \nVarious academics compare Assad's reign to tribal rule, with Assad as the tribal chieftain glorified by the system and extolled as its saviour. Syrian-French Professor of Sociology Burhan Ghalioun asserts that Bashar al-Assad doesn't see Syrians as an independent people, but rather as guests in his family property. Hence, Assad's dictatorship is akin to the colonial project of an invading empire, according to Ghalioun. Syrian historian Rana Kabbani designates Assad's dynastic rule as \"internal colonialism\" owing to the deep disconnect of the regime's post-colonial ruling classes from its native population and their blatant disregard for Syrian wealth and lives. Describing how neo-Ba'athist ideologues and Assadist security apparatus constructed a totalitarian state built around cult of personality to the Assad dynasty, Rana Kabbani writes: \"When Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez, came to power through yet another violent army squabble leading to his coup of 1970, an alarming cult of the leader was systematically formed around him, modelled on Ceausescu. The Romanian dictator was Assad's political ally, strategic adviser in matters of popular repression, and close personal and family friend...In the government school I attended in Damascus between 1971 and 1974, a process of wholesale brainwashing had begun. It was designed to create a population with no political personality or affiliation – other than to the head of what would become, in my children's generation, a vindictive family mafia, monopolising business and power with the crudest of propaganda machines and the most lethal of security services.\"  \n#### Mexico  \nThe scholar of Law and Economics Edgardo Buscaglia describes the political system of Mexico as a \"Mafiacracy\". Buscaglia characterises the condition between the state, the economy and organized crime in Mexico as a mutual interweaving, Mexico has also been labeled as a Narco-state (a political and economic term applied to countries where all legitimate institutions become penetrated by the power and wealth of the illegal drug trade).  \n#### Other  \nVenezuela under President Hugo Chávez has also been evaluated as creating the conditions for President Nicolás Maduro to consolidate a \"mafia state\", according to political scientists in Policy Studies in 2021. Moisés Naím, Venezuelan writer and the author of Illicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers, and Copycats Are Hijacking the Global Economy, wrote in an article for the American magazine Foreign Policy: \"In mafia states such as Bulgaria, Guinea-Bissau, Montenegro, Myanmar, Ukraine, and Venezuela, the national interest and the interests of organised crime are now inextricably intertwined.\"  \nDuring the 1990s, Aruba, an overseas constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, was alleged to be a mafia state under then Prime Minister Henny Eman. The Sicilian Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan was said to \"own\" over 60% of the island through investments in hotels, casinos, and donations towards Eman's election campaign. These claims later turned out to be exaggerated, however.  \nAccording to journalist Masha Gessen, in 2016, sociologist Bálint Magyar popularized the term \"mafia state\" to describe the administration of Viktor Orbán in Hungary. Magyar argued that Orbán's method of taking power in Hungary, removing rivals and politicizing institutions for personal power, created a kind of regime known as a \"mafia state\". Magyar said that other states besides Hungary included Azerbaijan, Russia, and Kazakhstan as of 2016.  \nIn 2010, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had labelled Switzerland as a mafia state, stating that \"Switzerland is behaving like a criminal organisation and it is involved in money laundering, assassinations and terrorism.\"  \nJonathan Benton, the former head of a United Kingdom anti-corruption agency, described Malta as a \"mafia state\" where money laundering transactions of hundreds of millions of euros are made every year without any problem. He made this statement while speaking on BBC radio following the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\n\nQuestion: Which former leader was acquitted on charges of mafia association after a trial in their country?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship  \nThe 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship was a college football bowl game played on January 10, 2022, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. The eighth College Football Playoff National Championship, the game determined the national champion of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) for the 2021 season. Aside from the all star games following after, this was the cumulating game of the 2021-22 bowl season. The game featured the No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide (winners of the Cotton Bowl) and the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs (winners of the Orange Bowl), both of whom represented the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The game began at 8:16 p.m. EST and was broadcast by ESPN. Sponsored by telecommunications company AT&T, the game was officially known as the 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship presented by AT&T. Georgia entered the game seeking its third national championship, while Alabama entered seeking its 19th.  \nThe game started slow offensively, as a field goal on Alabama's opening drive proved to be the only points of the first quarter. After Georgia scored a field goal of their own to tie the game early in the second quarter, the Crimson Tide kicked two more field goals to extend their lead to six points. A Georgia field goal with just over three minutes in the first half narrowed the deficit to three points, and the game went to halftime with Alabama leading 9–6. Looking to reinstate their six-point lead early in the third, Alabama's 48-yard field goal attempt was blocked and Georgia drove down the field to take their first lead by scoring the game's first touchdown. Alabama responded, scoring nine unanswered points with the help of a recovered fumble, to retake the lead by five points. These would be their final points of the contest; Georgia scored two touchdowns to take an eight-point lead and Kelee Ringo capped the win with a 79-yard interception return. The game ended with Georgia defeating Alabama by a score of 33–18 and winning their third national championship in school history, the first since 1980.  \n## Background  \nThis was the third of four consecutive College Football Playoff National Championship games matching the Number 3 seed and the No. 1 seed, with No. 1 LSU defeating the No. 3 Clemson Tigers 42-25 in the 2020 edition, and No. 1 Alabama defeating the No. 3 Ohio State Buckeyes 52-24 in the 2021 edition.  \n### Host selection  \nOn November 1, 2017, Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana, was announced as the site for the eighth College Football Playoff (CFP) National Championship. Indianapolis was the eighth different city, and the first \"cold-weather city\", to host the College Football Playoff National Championship (after Arlington, Glendale, Tampa, Atlanta, Santa Clara, New Orleans, and Miami Gardens). Additionally, this was the first time in college football's modern history that the national championship was not won in the South or the West. The city was selected after it was invited by the College Football Playoff to bid for the event, who specifically requested that Indianapolis bid for the 2022 event. The host committee was chaired by Mark Howell, the CEO of the Indianapolis-based company Angie's List (now Angi). While this was the first college football national championship hosted by Lucas Oil Stadium, the venue has been the home stadium for the Indianapolis Colts since 2008 and has hosted the Big Ten Football Championship Game since its inception in 2011, Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, and Final Fours in 2010, 2015, and 2021.  \nThe stadium was \"cashless\" for the game, as it has been since 2020, and face masks were highly recommended but were not required.  \n### College Football Playoff  \nThe championship game was the eighth in College Football Playoff history. The semifinal games were both played on December 31, 2021. In the first semifinal, played at the 2021 Cotton Bowl Classic in Arlington, Texas, Alabama defeated Cincinnati, 27–6. In the second semifinal, played at the 2021 Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Florida, Georgia defeated Michigan, 34–11. These wins by Alabama and Georgia qualified them to the national championship game. This was the second appearance by Georgia in the College Football Playoff, after a debut appearance in 2017 which saw them defeat Oklahoma in the 2017 Rose Bowl in double overtime and fall to Alabama in overtime in the championship game. They entered the title game with an overall CFP record of 2–1. Alabama made their seventh appearance in the playoff in 2021, with 2019 being the only year they failed to qualify. In their previous appearances, they won three national championships and had lost in a further two championship games (to Clemson in both 2017 and 2019). They entered the contest with an overall record of 9–3 in the College Football Playoff.  \n## Teams  \nThe 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship featured the No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide and the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs. It was the teams' 72nd meeting, with Alabama leading the series 42–25–4; they first met in 1895 and played frequently from 1901 to the mid-1970s. Alabama won the last seven meetings between the teams, with Georgia's last victory over the Tide coming in 2007. Entering the contest, the teams last met just over a month before, as Alabama defeated Georgia, 41–24, in the 2021 SEC Championship Game. This was the second time Georgia and Alabama have played for a national championship; the Crimson Tide defeated the Bulldogs in the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship, 26–23, in overtime. Alabama entered the game holding a 4–0 postseason advantage over Georgia, having won three SEC Championship games (2012, 2018, and 2021) in addition to the aforementioned national championship game.  \nThis was the second CFP National Championship appearance for Georgia, after losing to Alabama in the 2018 edition. The Bulldogs claimed two national championships overall; in 1942 and 1980. Alabama made their sixth CFP National Championship appearance; the Crimson Tide won titles in 2015, 2017, and 2020, and they appeared in the 2016 and 2018 title games as well. In total, Alabama claims 18 national championships, with the first in 1925.  \n### Alabama  \n<image>Alabama head coach Nick Saban (pictured in 2009).\nThe top-ranked Crimson Tide, led by 15th-year head coach Nick Saban, opened their season with a neutral site kickoff game, as they faced No. 14 Miami (FL) in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game. The game ended with an Alabama victory, as the Tide won convincingly to earn a 1–0 start to their national title defense. They opened their home season with a win against FCS Mercer, and followed it with their first SEC contest at No. 11 Florida, which saw Alabama escape an upset bid with a two-point win against the Gators. Alabama would rout Southern Miss the following week, in a game that featured Jameson Williams record three touchdowns of 80 yards or more, before defeating No. 12 Ole Miss by three touchdowns at home to extend their streak to six consecutive wins in that rivalry series. The Tide suffered their first and only regular season setback the following week, when they were upset by Texas A&M in College Station thanks to Seth Small's 28-yard field goal as time expired, which gave the Aggies a three-point victory. This loss snapped a 19-game winning streak for the Tide and dropped Alabama to No. 5 in the AP Poll, though they were able to rebound with impressive wins over Mississippi State and Tennessee to put their record at 7–1 entering their bye week. To begin the month of November, the Crimson Tide hosted LSU, whom they defeated by six points; Alabama then defeated New Mexico State, their final non-conference opponent, by a score of 59–3. The Tide's final home game came against No. 21 Arkansas; Alabama won by only a touchdown despite quarterback Bryce Young's school-record 559 passing yards, and the Tide dropped to No. 3 in the College Football Playoff rankings. With the win, Alabama clinched the SEC West Division title and their spot in the SEC Championship Game. The Crimson Tide concluded their regular season a week later with an Iron Bowl matchup against Auburn. The game went to four overtimes before Alabama came away with a two-point victory; this was the first game in Iron Bowl history to reach overtime. The Crimson Tide then defeated No. 1 Georgia in the 2021 SEC Championship Game, bumping them back to No. 1 and earning them a place in the playoff. Alabama defeated No. 4 Cincinnati in their semifinal matchup at the 2021 Cotton Bowl Classic, earning them a championship game berth, and ensuring that no team finishing the season unbeaten. They entered the game with a record of 13–1 and a 7–1 mark in conference play.\n\n### Georgia  \n<image>Georgia head coach Kirby Smart (pictured in 2013).\nLed by sixth-year head coach Kirby Smart, the fifth-ranked Bulldogs began their season with a matchup against No. 3 Clemson in the Duke's Mayo Classic. The game, which hosted College GameDay earlier that morning, played out to a low-scoring 10–3 Georgia win, putting them in the No. 2 spot in the rankings just one week into the season. The Bulldogs put on a dominant performance in their home opener the next week, as they scored eight touchdowns and allowed just one in a victory over UAB, and soundly defeated South Carolina the following week to open SEC play. Back-to-back shutouts followed, as the Bulldogs kept both Vanderbilt and No. 8 Arkansas off the scoreboard, while scoring 62 and 37 points of their own, respectively. Georgia continued their form with two more wins against ranked opponents, as they defeated No. 18 Auburn on the road and No. 11 Kentucky at home; the former game saw Georgia play as the No. 1 team in the nation for the first time this season following Texas A&M's upset of then-No. 1 Alabama, and the latter game was the first in which Georgia allowed more than one touchdown. The Bulldogs returned to neutral site play when they faced Florida following a bye week; they defeated the Gators 34–7, with their three touchdowns in just over three minutes at the end of the game's second quarter contributing to the win. This was also the week that Georgia clinched the SEC East's berth in the championship game, as a result of Kentucky's loss to Mississippi State. The Bulldogs finished their conference season in much the same style as the games before; they defeated Missouri 43–6, and allowed a season-high 17 points to Tennessee, though still managed to win by three possessions. Georgia finished the regular season with a pair of non-conference games, as they routed the Charleston Southern Buccaneers by seven scores and their rivals Georgia Tech by the same number, concluding Georgia's first undefeated regular season since 1982. The Bulldogs fell to No. 3 Alabama in the SEC Championship Game; Georgia subsequently dropped to No. 3 and were selected for the College Football Playoff. They were picked to face No. 2 Michigan in the Orange Bowl, where they won to earn their spot in the championship game. Georgia entered the contest with a record of 13–1 and an 8–0 mark in SEC play.\n\n## Starting lineups  \nSource:  \n## Game summary  \n### First half  \nScheduled for an 8:00 p.m. EST start, the game began at 8:16 p.m. with Jake Camarda's opening kickoff resulting in a touchback. As a result, Alabama began their first drive at their own 25-yard-line. Brian Robinson Jr. got each of the game's first two carries, and Bryce Young completed passes to Slade Bolden and Jameson Williams to get first downs on the drive. Driving to the Georgia 19-yard-line, Young's pass was incomplete, forcing a 37-yard field goal attempt for Alabama, which was made by Will Reichard. Alabama's defense proved to be effective on Georgia's first drive of the game, as Christian Harris took down Stetson Bennett for a 14-yard sack; despite a 14-yard rush by Bennett a few plays later, a delay of game penalty doomed the Bulldogs to a three-and-out, and Camarda punted the ball away. The kick was fair caught by Bolden at the Alabama 20-yard line. On the second play of their ensuing drive, Young found Williams for a 15-yard gain and a first down, which would be their only first down of the drive. The Tide offense stalled and James Burnip's punt was fair caught by Kearis Jackson at the Georgia 25-yard-line. Georgia's offense was again unable to move the ball, as they gained one yard on three plays and punted the ball back to Alabama, who took possession at their own 45-yard-line after Ameer Speed was called for a kick catch interference penalty. Alabama also found themselves unable to gain a first down, and they were forced to punt the ball back to the Bulldogs four plays later after their first three-and-out of the game. Burnip's kick was caught by Jackson at the Georgia 8-yard-line. After a personal foul set Georgia back to their own 4-yard-line on their first play, the Bulldogs were able to get a first down for the first time on a 19-yard pass from Bennett to Darnell Washington, which was immediately followed by a 52-yard pass from Bennett to George Pickens, which put Georgia in Alabama territory for the first time. They advanced the ball to the Alabama 23-yard-line before the first quarter came to an end.  \nFacing a 2nd & 14 to begin the second quarter, the Bulldogs picked up a first down within two plays, and advanced the ball down to the Alabama 5-yard-line before bringing up 4th & Goal. Jack Podlesny's 24-yard field goal attempt was successful, giving Georgia their first points of the contest and tying the game at three points apiece. Alabama began their next drive at their own 25-yard-line following a touchback; their first play was a 40-yard pass from Young to Williams, though Williams went down with a non-contact injury to his left knee and left the game following that play. Young completed several more short passes on the drive but could not pick up another first down, and Alabama retook the lead on a 45-yard Will Reichard field goal with just over eleven minutes to play. Georgia started their next drive at their own 15-yard-line following a false start penalty and was unable to get past their own 22-yard-line; Camarda's punt on 4th & 8 was muffed by Bolden, who then recovered the ball back at the Alabama 26-yard-line. The first play of the drive went for a 5-yard gain, but the following play was a 61-yard completion from Young to Cameron Latu, which put Alabama on the Georgia 8-yard-line. However, Alabama's offense stalled, gaining two yards on the next two plays and then losing 13 on a sack by Channing Tindall, forcing a field goal try. Reichard's 37-yard kick was good, giving Alabama a six-point lead. After getting the ball back with seven minutes to play, Georgia reached Alabama territory in four plays, and converted a third down with a pass from Bennett to Adonai Mitchell on the next play. A sack by Dallas Turner on the following play set Georgia behind the sticks and they were ultimately not able to recover; Jack Podlesny converted a 49-yard field goal on 4th & 6, narrowing the margin to three. Alabama's final possession of the half started on their own 25-yard-line; a 24-yard pass from Young to Agiye Hall put the Tide in Georgia territory, but a pair of incompletions from Young made it fourth down. Burnip was sent back on to punt, and the kick was fair caught at the Georgia 10-yard-line. Looking to run out the clock, Zamir White ran the ball three straight times for a net total of 15 yards, which concluded the second quarter. Alabama entered halftime leading the game, 9–6.  \n### Second half  \nConfetti flies after Georgia finalizes its win in the title game.  \nGeorgia began the third quarter with possession of the ball, with Reichard's kickoff going out for a touchback. Zamir White carried the ball for 11 yards on the half's first play, and then again for 19 yards on the following play, earning a first down each time. An intentional grounding penalty called on Bennett on the next play, a flea flicker, set Georgia back to 2nd & 19, and they were unable to recover. Camarda was brought on to punt on 4th & 8, and his kick was fair caught by Bolden at the Alabama 7-yard-line. Alabama's first possession of the second half was brief; Young's pass was intercepted by Christopher Smith at the Alabama 43-yard-line, giving Georgia possession again. The Bulldogs were not able to capitalize off of this miscue, as they went three-and-out, gaining only three yards. Camarda's punt was downed at the Alabama 2-yard-line. The Crimson Tide escaped the shadow of their own goalposts in a few plays; Robinson's carry for 16 yards on 2nd & 9 advanced the ball to the Alabama 19-yard-line and the Tide had another first down within two more plays. They reached Georgia territory three plays after that and got the ball to the Georgia 30-yard-line before two straight incompletions brought up 4th & 11. Reichard's field goal attempt was the first of the night to be unsuccessful, as the 48-yard try was blocked by Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter, giving the Bulldogs possession at their own 20-yard-line. Georgia was quick to capitalize; running back James Cook took the ball inside the Alabama red zone with a 67-yard rush, and a pair of rushes from Bennett and Kenny McIntosh afterwards advanced the ball to the Alabama 1-yard-line. On 1st & Goal, Zamir White scored the game's first touchdown, a one-yard rush, giving Georgia their first lead of the game. Getting possession of the ball back at their own 25-yard-line, Alabama ran three plays to advance to their own 41-yard-line before the end of the third quarter.  \nAlabama began the fourth quarter with a seven-yard pass from Young to Bolden; a hands to the face penalty called on the Bulldogs' Robert Beal Jr. gave the Tide a first down on the following play and a 28-yard pass from Young to Hall took Alabama all the way down to the Georgia 5-yard-line. Two incompletions and a two-yard rush brought up 4th & Goal, and Reichard was brought on for another field goal attempt; this 21-yard try was good, bringing the Crimson Tide's deficit to one point. Georgia began their next drive at their own 25-yard-line after a touchback, but lost the ball shortly thereafter as a fumble by Bennett on the drive's third play was recovered at the Georgia 16-yard-line by Brian Branch. Alabama, starting their drive inside the red zone, benefitted from a roughing the passer call on second down and scored their first touchdown three plays later, as Young found Latu in the end zone for a three-yard passing touchdown. Young's rush on the two-point conversion attempt was unsuccessful, leaving Alabama's lead at five points. Beginning from a touchback, Georgia took to the passing game to move the ball on their ensuing drive. Bennett completed passes of 18 and 10 yards, with a 15-yard pass interference penalty in between, to move the ball to the Alabama 32-yard-line. Following a sack, Bennett connected with Adonai Mitchell for a 40-yard touchdown pass to the back corner of the end zone to reclaim the lead for the Bulldogs; the two-point rush by James Cook was no good, keeping Georgia's lead at one. Alabama went three-and-out on their next possession, with James Burnip's punt fair caught by Jackson at the Georgia 38-yard-line. Zamir White carried the ball on each of Georgia's next four plays, gaining two first downs, and the Bulldogs got another by virtue of a pass interference call on Kool-Aid McKinstry. Three plays later, Bennett connected with tight end Brock Bowers for a 15-yard touchdown, giving Georgia an eight-point lead. Driving with a chance to tie the game, Alabama gained a pair of first downs and reached Georgia territory in five plays, with just under a minute and a half to play. On 3rd & 10, following two incompletions, Young's pass downfield was intercepted by Kelee Ringo who returned it 79 yards for a touchdown, giving Georgia a lead of fifteen points. Getting the ball back with 54 seconds remaining, Alabama was able to string together a series of first-down passes, as Young found Ja'Corey Brooks for gains of 20 and 11 yards, respectively, but an intentional grounding penalty on Young set them back to their own 43-yard-line. A sack by Robert Beal set Alabama further back to their own 36-yard line, and the game concluded after two further plays. The game ended at 11:57 p.m., after a total of three hours and 41 minutes, with Georgia having defeated Alabama, 33–18, to win the national championship.  \n### Scoring summary  \n## Statistics  \n## Broadcasting  \nThe game was televised in the United States by ESPN, with Megacast coverage across other ESPN linear channels and streaming. The network aired a world premiere of the music video for Alesso and Katy Perry's new single \"When I'm Gone\" during the halftime report—the first time ESPN had ever premiered a music video during live event coverage.  \nThe ESPN Megacast coverage spanned seven networks: the main broadcast of the game was shown on ESPN, a coaches' film room broadcast featuring Texas A&M head coach Jimbo Fisher and members of his staff was broadcast on ESPN2, the \"command center\" broadcast aired on ESPNU, the skycam feed was broadcast on ESPNews, the Spanish language broadcast was shown on ESPN Deportes, the \"hometown radio\" broadcast, featuring radio announcers from both Georgia and Alabama, was shown on the SEC Network, and the national radio broadcast was on ESPN Radio. Additionally, the individual \"hometown radio\" broadcasts, additional skycam feeds, the \"all-22\" broadcast, and the halftime marching band performances were all streamed on the ESPN app.  \nThe game was televised in Canada by TSN, which aired a simulcast of ESPN's coverage. Megacast coverage was also featured, with Skycast airing on TSN2, Command Center airing on TSN3, and Coaches Film Room airing on TSN Direct.  \n### Commentary teams  \nThe primary broadcast team from Saturday Night Football, Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, and Holly Rowe, served as the commentator, analyst, and sideline reporter for the main ESPN broadcast; Molly McGrath also joined the crew as a sideline reporter alongside Rowe. The commentary team on ESPN Deportes consisted of Eduardo Varela, Pablo Viruega, and Rebeca Landa. ESPN Radio's broadcast team consisted of Sean McDonough and Todd Blackledge, who shared the commentary booth for a College Football Playoff National Championship for the sixth time, as well as Ian Fitzsimmons and Kris Budden, who both reported from the sidelines. Two former referees contributed to the broadcasts as rules experts: Bill Lemonnier, a former Big Ten Conference official, was a part of the primary ESPN broadcast, and Matt Austin, a former Southeastern Conference official, contributed to the ESPN Radio broadcast.  \nThe \"Hometown Radio\" feeds were presented with each team's regular radio commentary teams. The Alabama feed was commentated by Eli Gold, John Parker Wilson, and Rashad Johnson, and broadcast in conjunction with the Alabama Crimson Tide Sports Network. The Georgia feed was commentated by Scott Howard, Eric Zeier, and D. J. Shockley, and was broadcast in conjunction with the Georgia Bulldog Sports Network.  \n## Aftermath  \nGeorgia's win marked their first national championship since 1980, a gap of 41 years. They finished the season with a record of 14–1, while Alabama finished with a 13–2 record. This was the first time a Georgia team had recorded 14 wins in a single season. Georgia quarterback Stetson Bennett, the first walk-on quarterback to defeat a team coached by Nick Saban since 1997, was named the offensive player of the game, while Georgia safety Lewis Cine was named defensive player of the game. The win was the first for Georgia head coach Kirby Smart over Alabama head coach Nick Saban, for whom he worked as an assistant previously. The win was the first for Georgia against Alabama overall since the 2007 season, Saban's first at Alabama. Georgia also became the first No. 3 seed to win the College Football Playoff National Championship.  \nDuring the postgame handshake, Saban told Smart, \"you guys kicked our ass in the fourth quarter,\" referring to Georgia's three unanswered touchdowns to conclude the game which propelled them from a five-point deficit to a fifteen-point lead. In return, Smart asked about the condition of Alabama wide receiver Jameson Williams, who left the game with an injury in the second quarter; Saban responded that Williams had likely torn his ACL.  \nThis was the final game for Georgia defensive coordinator Dan Lanning before his departure for the head coaching position at Oregon. He was hired on December 11, 2021, but committed to coaching Georgia through the conclusion of their season. Coincidentally, his first game at Oregon was the 2022 season opener, which was against Georgia.  \nA total of 68,311 people attended the game, making it one of seven sellouts of the 2021–22 bowl game season. Both of the playoff semifinals were among the list of seven, as were the Gasparilla Bowl, Music City Bowl, Birmingham Bowl, and Rose Bowl.  \nGeorgia would go on an undefeated 2022 season, and beat TCU in the next season's national championship, winning 65-7, in the largest margin of victory in any bowl game in the FBS, to become the first team since the 2012 Alabama Crimson Tide to repeat as national champions. Alabama meanwhile had an up and down season. They were the preseason #1 team but struggled in Week 2 against Texas, winning 20-19 thanks to a last-second field goal by Will Reichard. They started out 6-0 but had to pull away against #20 Arkansas and won 49-26 after nearly blowing a 28-0 lead in Fayetteville (the score was only 28-23 in favor of Alabama at one point after the Tide jumped out to a 28-0 lead), and also struggled against unranked Texas A&M at home (they had lost to the Aggies in College Station the year before on a last-second field goal by a score of 41-38), but they won 24-20. They then traveled to Knoxville where they lost to rival Tennessee for the first time since 2006 by a score of 52-49 on a game-winning field goal by Tennessee kicker Chase McGrath. They were still considered a possible contender for the College Football Playoff after only dropping from #3 to #6 in the rankings, and had a dominating 30-6 win over #24 Mississippi State, but they suffered their second loss to LSU in overtime 32-31 thanks to a successful 2-point conversion pass from Jayden Daniels to Mason Taylor. This loss knocked them out of contention for not only the Playoff but also the SEC West title, as LSU had tiebreaker wins over Ole Miss and Alabama, the other two contenders for the Western Division title. The Crimson Tide did win the remainder of their games, however, and also knocked Ole Miss out of SEC West contention. They were invited to the Sugar Bowl where they routed Big 12 champion Kansas State by a score of 45-20 after falling behind 10-0 early. They finished 11-2 (6-2 in the SEC) and ranked #5 in both of the major polls.\n\nQuestion: Which team was undefeated during the regular season according to the descriptions provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Janetta Johnson  \nJanetta Louise Johnson (born 1964/1965) is an American transgender rights activist, human rights activist, prison abolitionist, and transgender woman. She is the Executive Director of the TGI Justice Project. She co-founded the non-profit TAJA's Coalition in 2015. Along with Honey Mahogany and Aria Sa'id, Johnson is a co-founder of The Transgender District, established in 2017. Johnson's work is primarily concerned about the rights and safety of incarcerated and formerly-incarcerated transgender and gender-non-conforming people. She believes that the abolition of police and the prison industrial complex will help support the safety of transgender people, and she identifies as an abolitionist.  \n## Early life  \nFrom the time she was seventeen or eighteen years old, Janetta Johnson knew that she was a transgender woman and that she wanted to medically transition. Johnson came out as a transgender woman in the 1980s.  \nIn 1997, Johnson moved from her hometown, Tampa, Florida, to San Francisco in order to be mentored by Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a transgender rights activist, prison abolitionist, and former director of the TGI Justice Project. Johnson describes Miss Major as her \"adopted trans mother\" because Miss Major extensively mentored and supported her. When she initially came to San Francisco, Johnson faced houselessness and stayed in a shelter, but she still closely worked under Miss Major's leadership. For the first three years after moving to San Francisco, Miss Major Griffin-Gracy taught Johnson about politics and community organizing, and Johnson described this experience as \"life-changing.\" She said that living in San Francisco was the first time she saw transgender women \"living their lives authentically,\" which was another reason she decided to move to San Francisco.  \nDuring the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Johnson began selling drugs to survive, and she also engaged in sex work. Due to drug charges, she was sentenced to six years in men's federal prison but ultimately was incarcerated for three-and-a-half years. During her time, she was denied gender-affirming health care and subjected to transphobia, misgendering, and sexual, physical, and verbal abuse. She became involved in a nine-month, early release program while incarcerated, which shortened her sentence, and she was released on May 21, 2012.  \nWhile Johnson was incarcerated, she started fighting for the rights of incarcerated trans people and shifted her activism to mainly working around issues around the incarceration of trans people. After Johnson was released from prison in 2012, she continued and escalated her involvement in transgender rights activism for incarcerated transgender women and gender-non-conforming individuals. In 2015, Miss Major Griffin-Gracy retired from the TGI Justice Project and Janetta Johnson was hired as the new Executive Director.  \n## Beliefs  \n### Abolition  \nJohnson identifies as an abolitionist in a variety of ways, namely in terms of police and prisons. Janetta Johnson wants to abolish police — namely the San Francisco Police — and re-invest that money into housing, higher education, and healthcare for the community. As a formerly incarcerated woman herself, Johnson is also against systems of mass incarceration and wants to abolish prisons. Rather than using the prison industrial complex to respond to crime, she advocates for the use of restorative justice. She is especially insistent on the abolition of San Francisco systems of incarceration, and she is quoted at a 2018 rally calling for the closure of San Francisco's jail at the Hall of Justice saying, \"San Francisco talks about being creative and innovative and a leader in all these things well, closing jails is one of the most important and amazing things that we can do. We need alternatives to jails and prisons.\"  \nThrough bills and policy, Johnson says she is working to ideally reduce the prison industrial complex by 65%.  \n### Economic justice  \nJanetta Johnson believes in obtaining economic justice for trans and gender-non-conforming individuals. She believes that in order to do this, “transgender people have to have their own businesses, they have to have their own homes.” One of the ways she is working toward economic justice for trans people is through establishing The Transgender District, as one of its goals is to \"economically empower the transgender community through ownership of homes, businesses, historic and cultural sites, and safe community spaces,\" and it has an Economics and Workforce Development Initiative that helps transgender people find employment opportunities. She also works toward economic justice by hiring formerly incarcerated trans and gender variant people at the TGI Justice Project so that they obtain work experience and have an income.  \n## Activism  \n### TGI Justice Project  \n#### Overview  \n<image>Janetta Johnson as Executive Director of the TGI Justice Project, accompanied by members of El/La TransLatinas, speaks on stage at the San Francisco Trans March 2016.\nFounded in 2004, the Transgender, Gender-Variant & Intersex Justice Project or TGI Justice Project was initially established to provide legal services to incarcerated or formerly-incarcerated transgender and gender-variant individuals. Contemporarily, the non-profit describes itself as \"a group of transgender, gender variant and intersex people–inside and outside of prisons, jails and detention centers–creating a united family in the struggle for survival and freedom.” They focus on many facets of transgender issues, such as law and policy, human rights, imprisonment, police violence, racism, poverty, and societal pressures and stigma. The organization follows prison/police abolitionist beliefs and is working to abolish prisons and police. They also work to support Black trans leadership by putting Black trans people in leadership roles at the organization, helping community members with re-entry into society from incarceration, and supporting transgender and gender-non-conforming individuals with navigating law and legal policy. The TGI Justice Project is one of the first and only organizations to be led by formerly incarcerated trans women of color. Miss Major Griffin-Gracy was the Executive Director from 2005 to 2015.  \nWhile incarcerated from 2009 to 2012, Johnson served as the Referral Liaison to the TGI Justice Project. Miss Major remained in regular communication with Johnson while incarcerated and told her that once she was released from prison, she wanted Johnson to be the next Executive Director of the TGI Justice Project. In 2015, Miss Major retired and Johnson became the Executive Director of TGI Justice. Because the TGI Justice Project does not have enough funds to hire more employees, Johnson, as Executive Director, does the majority of the work at the non-profit.  \nDuring her time employed at the TGI Justice Project, Johnson created the program Black Girlz Rulez, which is a national Black trans convening that cultivates community and uses intersectionality to approach issues that affect Black trans women.\n\n#### Re-entry program  \nJohnson initiated TGI Justice Project's re-entry program that helps transgender and gender-variant people re-enter society immediately after being released from prison in order to prevent recidivism. While being incarcerated herself, she met many transgender women who said they had been incarcerated several times due to a lack of support during their re-entry to society. Johnson was inspired to create the re-entry program. Johnson is quoted saying, \"After I was incarcerated I decided, I’m going to create a program so that Black trans women don’t fall through the cracks.” Now Johnson runs the re-entry program in order to prevent Black trans women from \"falling through the cracks.\"  \nThe TGI Justice Project's re-entry program aims to support transgender and gender-variant people re-enter society from incarceration through providing housing, food, money, and access to mental and physical health care services for sixty to ninety days after their release date. Johnson works with community members to arrange picking up recently-released people from their former incarceration facilities and bringing them to temporary housing in hotels or motels. The program also pays current members a salary of at least $25 an hour to financially support their re-entry to society, as Johnson claims that \"Reentry must come with a paycheck.\" Johnson notes that finding housing for the re-entry program and for trans people in general has become more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n#### COVID-19 impact  \nJohnson noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique challenges for transgender people, saying \"any type of disease or stigma is always attached to trans people.\" Because of this, Janetta Johnson has had TGI Justice Project put a greater focus on crisis case management and general community care for transgender people during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the major ways she does this is through housing support, which has become an even more prominent issue during the pandemic. Johnson claims that seeing houseless people setting up encampments near her residence has inspired her to have empathy and create housing initiatives. During the pandemic, Johnson says she has spent many days finding hotels that will rent rooms to transgender people, as many will refuse to rent them or increase the price of rental once they learn that the prospective occupier is transgender. As of June 2020, the organization housed thirty trans and gender-non-conforming individuals. The TGI Justice Project also has volunteers bring meals and groceries to the people that they house in hotels and food and hygiene products to houseless trans people living on the streets.  \nJohnson noted that there was an increase in donations to the TGI Justice Project after the uprising about the murder of George Floyd that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n### TAJA's Coalition  \nJanetta Johnson co-founded the non-profit TAJA's Coalition in February 2015. The organization was formed in response to the murder of Taja Gabrielle de Jesus, a trans woman of color who resided in San Francisco. TAJA's Coalition aims to create safety for trans women and gender-non-conforming individuals through increasing their access to education and housing.  \n### The Transgender District  \n<image>A sign reads \"Compton's Transgender Cultural District\" at the intersection of Eddy and Mason streets in San Francisco's Tenderloin. Poles in the background are painted with the blue, pink, and white colors of the Transgender Pride Flag.In 2017, Janetta Johnson co-founded the world's first legally recognized transgender cultural district, The Transgender District, in the Tenderloin of San Francisco with Honey Mahogany and Aria Sa'id, two other Black trans women. Out of the three co-founders, Aria Sa'id is the only person who remains part of The Transgender District staff today. The District encompasses six blocks in the southeastern Tenderloin, San Francisco, and crosses over Market Street to include two blocks of Sixth Street. It contains several historically significant sites, such as the former location of Compton's Cafeteria and the Compton's Cafeteria Riot at the corner of Turk Street and Taylor Street. Turk Street and Taylor Street have been renamed by the District as “Compton’s Cafeteria Way” and “Vikki Mar Lane” respectively.\nJohnson and the other founders of the district were inspired to create The Transgender District after a real-estate development company named Group i announced plans to erect a new residential building and hotel in the eastern part of the Tenderloin, gentrifying the area. Brian Basinger, the Executive Director of Q Foundation, a non-profit that centers around houseless people living with HIV/AIDS in the Tenderloin, filed a declaration against Group i's plans. Basinger gathered support from the St. James Infirmary, a health clinic for people who do sex work, where Aria Sa'id served as Program Director. They accumulated more support from other community members and organizations, such as Janetta Johnson with the TGI Justice Project. Basinger's initial declaration wasn't successful, and Group i still wanted to go through with their development plans, but Group i actually ended up providing financial support so that they could establish The Transgender District.  \nThe District was originally named Compton's Transgender Cultural District after the historic August 1966 Compton's Cafeteria Riot, one of the first demonstrations of transgender resistance in the United States. The riot was a response to the police harassment of transgender and gender-non-conforming individuals, particularly transgender women.  Cross-dressing was illegal at the time due to anti-masquerading laws, which was the basis for a lot of police brutality and harassment of transgender women. A trans woman interviewed in the documentary Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria could get arrested for having the buttons on the \"wrong\" side (i.e. the left side of the shirt, where buttons tend to be placed on women's clothing). Although the riot was undocumented in newspapers, the Compton's Cafeteria Riot was \"rediscovered\" and popularized by Susan Stryker in her 2015 film Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria, which ultimately led to the creation of The Transgender District.  \nThe Transgender District's mission is \"to create an urban environment that fosters the rich history, culture, legacy, and empowerment of transgender people and its deep roots in the southeastern Tenderloin neighborhood... and to stabilize and economically empower the transgender community through ownership of homes, businesses, historic and cultural sites, and safe community spaces.\" Johnson's primary hope for the District is to create a \"safe space\" for transgender people, and she is quoted saying \"I believe in creating a space without violence, discrimination, and over-policing; and making sure Black trans women have opportunities for ownership and cultural spaces where they feel safe.\"\n\n### Legal and policy work  \nJanetta Johnson worked on the California legislative campaign to pass Senate Bill 310, commonly known as the Name and Dignity Act, which was co-sponsored by the TGI Justice Project and successfully passed in October 2017. It is a law that allows transgender people to petition the superior court to change their name and gender marker while incarcerated in California, which Johnson says makes re-entry into society easier. Johnson is quoted saying, “A person exiting prison with identification documents that actually match who they are in terms of name and gender identity has an exponential impact on their ability to access life-giving services without some of the discrimination that comes with having identification documents that don’t match their gender presentation.”  \nDuring the pandemic, Johnson and the TGI Justice Project have provided legal support to incarcerated persons inside two prisons local to the organization, Mule Creek State Prison and Kern Valley State Prison.  \nJohnson has also formerly been a member of the Transgender Law Center's national coalition.\n\nQuestion: Which individual played a significant role in both the establishment of the TGI Justice Project and the creation of The Transgender District in San Francisco?\nChoice list: \nA.

Five additional people were charged between November 2018 and January 2019. See list of co-defendants. alleged members and associates of the street gang Nine Trey Gangsters. The case is notable for its inclusion of rapper 6ix9ine, real name Daniel Hernandez, and his associate Kifano \"Shotti\" Jordan as defendants.  \nThe men were indicted on charges related to racketeering, weapon possession, and conspiracy to commit murder. Hernandez was quickly made a person of interest in these charges and was apprehended alongside five other men on November 18, 2018, following a five-year joint investigation by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the New York Police Department (NYPD), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).  \nUpon his arrest, Hernandez was initially denied bail and pleaded not guilty to all charges. He later changed his plea to guilty after agreeing to a deal with law enforcement on February 1, 2019. The guilty plea resulted in Hernandez admitting his guilt and testifying against his co-defendants, as well as full co-operation and an insistence to commit no further crimes, in exchange for reduced prison time. On December 18, 2019, Hernandez was sentenced to two years in prison, a $35,000 fine, five years of supervised release, and 1,000 hours of community service. Hernandez ended up avoiding a potential minimum sentence of 47 years. Hernandez was originally set to be released on November 18, 2020, although his attorney Lance Lazzaro claimed \"6ix9ine will be released ahead of schedule.\" His new release date was set for August 2, 2020, although reports surfaced saying he may be released as early as July 31, 2020. However, on April 1, 2020, federal judge Paul Engelmayer ordered Hernandez to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement starting the next day due to him suffering from asthma which makes him particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.  \n## Background  \n<image>6ix9ine (pictured) was arrested in the week leading up to the scheduled release of his debut album Dummy Boy.\nIn October 2018, Hernandez was sentenced to two years' probation and 1,000 hours of community service after pleading guilty to federal racketeering and firearms charges. To celebrate receiving probation instead of a jail sentence, Hernandez went to go have dinner with a music executive in New York City. His entourage was not allowed in by security, and this led to a fight that ended with one person being shot. Two members of Hernandez's entourage were charged with gang assault. Hernandez's manager Jordan later turned himself in on November 7, 2018, in relation to the fight and was also charged with gang assault.  \nOn November 15, 2018, three days prior to the arrests and a week prior to the scheduled release of his debut album Dummy Boy, Hernandez unexpectedly announced on Instagram that he had fired his entire team, including his management. He also cancelled his upcoming tour and said, \"Whoever is booking shows for Tekashi 6ix9ine, is stealing your fucking money.\"\n\n## Arrest and guilty plea  \n### November 2018–January 2019: 'Not guilty' plea  \nOn the night of November 18, 2018, six men were arrested by ATF agents in New York City: Hernandez, Jordan, Jamel \"Mel Murda\" Jones, Fuguan \"Fu Banga\" Lovick, Jesnel \"Ish\" Butler, and Faheem \"Crippy\" Walter. The next night while being detained at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center, Hernandez was confronted by inmates affiliated with the rival Crips gang. Prison staff intervened and quickly transferred Hernandez to a different facility to eliminate any future gang threats. On November 22, 2018, a seventh man, Roland \"Ro Murda\" Martin, was arrested and charged with crimes related to the case. Hernandez's arrest caused his highly anticipated debut album Dummy Boy to be delayed indefinitely a day before its scheduled release.date=September 2019 After an online leak, Dummy Boy was released on November 27, 2018, and managed to reach number 2 on the Billboard 200 within only three days of charting.  \nOn November 26, 2018, Hernandez pleaded not guilty and was denied bail, with a court date set for September 4, 2019. Hernandez's lawyer continued to plea that his client was \"...completely innocent of all charges being brought against him... An entertainer who portrays a 'gangster image' to promote his music does not make him a member of an enterprise.\" An eighth defendant, Aaron \"Bat\" Young, was charged on December 19, 2018.  \n### February 2019–present: Co-operation with prosecutors  \n<image>Rapper Chief Keef was allegedly shot at by Hernandez's associates after engaging in an online feud with the rapper in June 2018.\nOn January 22, 2019, three other members of the Nine Trey Gangsters were charged as part of the investigation: Kintea \"Kooda B\" McKenzie, Denard \"Drama\" Butler, and Anthony \"Harv\" Ellison. McKenzie was indicted for attempting to shoot American rapper Chief Keef in June 2018. Hernandez admitted that after becoming embroiled in an online feud with Chief Keef, he offered $20,000 to McKenzie to carry out the shooting. McKenzie carried out the attack outside the W Hotel in Manhattan, though no one was injured. After the shooting, McKenzie allegedly met with Hernandez and Jordan, settling for a payment of $10,000 for the attack.  \nButler was indicted for taking part in a separate attempted shooting of Chief Keef on July 16, 2018, where a bystander was injured by the gunfire.  \nEllison was indicted for kidnapping and assaulting Hernandez on July 22, 2018, after he claimed Hernandez disrespected the Nine Treys. At the time, Hernandez reported the incident to police in July 2018, claiming that he had been pistol-whipped and forced in a car, but soon became uncooperative during the initial investigation.  \nOn January 23, 2019, Hernandez changed his plea to guilty to all nine charges against him, and admitted to being a member of the Nine Trey Gangsters. Hernandez pledged to cooperate with prosecutors against others. As part of the plea agreement, Hernandez will not be fully prosecuted for any of his nine charges as long as he fully cooperates in testifying against others and commits no further crimes. Following Hernandez's guilty plea, prosecutors leveled additional firearms and racketeering charges against Jordan.  \nHernandez's lawyer Dawn Florio began devising a plan to get him out of federal custody before September 2019 if the other co-defendants take plea deals to avoid a trial. On March 28, 2019, Jordan became the second co-defendant to enter a guilty plea. Jordan stated that \"6ix9ine broke every code. But I forgive the little nigga after all that. It's all good\", and noted that \"Treyway still stands strong. I want that to be known.\" In September 2019, Jordan was sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to one count of firearm possession during a crime and one count of firearm discharge during a crime.  \nOn April 2, 2019, Jesnel \"Ish\" Butler pleaded guilty to one firearms charge involving the April 2018 robbery of a backpack belonging to \"Scum Lord D!zzy\", the owner of Hernandez's label ScumGang. The next day, Walter pleaded guilty for involvement in the robbery as well. Jones also pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of participating in a narcotics distribution conspiracy for helping to move heroin and fentanyl. On April 19, 2019, Young pleaded guilty, becoming the sixth of the 11 defendants that have entered a guilty plea in the case.\n\n## List of co-defendants  \n## Timeline & Co-Defendants of trial  \nThe trial and its testimonies began on September 16, 2019 with Hernandez testifying for the government the next day. He disclosed the gang's inner structure and activities and later mentioned fellow rappers Jim Jones and Cardi B as members of various gangs.  \nOn October 3, defendants Anthony \"Harv\" Ellison and Aljermiah \"Nuke\" Mack were found guilty on kidnapping and racketeering charges, and currently face up to life in prison.  \nOn December 18, Hernandez was sentenced to 2 years in prison minus the 13 months already served, and 5 years of supervised liberty. On Thursday, April 2, 2020, Hernandez's lawyer, Dawn Florio, confirmed with XXL magazine that the court decided to allow the rapper to be released from prison and into home confinement. This was after Hernandez requested to serve the remainder of his prison sentence at home stating he was at a higher risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus due to his pre-existing asthma and bronchitis conditions. He was originally set to be released on August 2, 2020.\n\nQuestion: Which event occurred in June 2018 involving an individual from one of these images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# Country music in Atlanta  \nGeorgia Old-Time Fiddlers' Convention, 1914  \n<image>Fiddlin' John Carson\n\n<image>Gid Tanner\nAtlanta played a major role in launching country's earliest recording artists in the early 1920s — many Appalachian people such as Fiddlin' John Carson had come to the city and area to work in its cotton mills and brought their music with them. It would remain a major recording center for two decades and a major performance center for four decades, into the first country music TV shows on local Atlanta stations in the 1950s.\n\n## Origins and influences  \nMuch of the audience and many of the artists in Atlanta's country scene lived in the area's three main mill towns: Cabbagetown (Atlanta), a neighborhood in Atlanta itself, Chattahoochee, today within the city's northwestern limits and known as Whittier Mill Village, and Scottdale, just northeast of Decatur.  \nAtlanta county exhibited influences of Appalachian folk music, black music (notably blues and influences from \"Decatur Street\" black music scene) and gospel. The first \"country blues\" recording was likely in 1924, in Atlanta, by Ed Andrews.  \nAnnual Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers' Conventions took place in Atlanta in 1913–1935, a milestone in Atlanta's role as a marketplace for the country genre. Fiddling legend Fiddlin' John Carson placed fourth in the first convention in 1913.  \n## Radio and television  \nThe signal of WSB radio reached far into rural areas and was an important factor in creating country music \"stars\", similar to the role of WSM in Nashville. WSBs best known country music program was the WSB Barn Dance.  \nFrom August 1926 until October 1928, the Sears Agricultural Foundation hosted a radio show, broadcast from the Atlanta Sears tower (now Ponce City Market) called \"Dinner Bell R.F.D.\". R.F.D. stood for the club \"Radio Farmers' Democracy\". The show aired on WSB radio between noon and 1 pm three times a week, featuring old-time musicians and string bands  \nOther than the WSB Barn Dance and a few other exceptions, most of Atlanta's country radio programs stopped broadcasting by the early 1950s; stations broadcast recorded music. Some local country music TV programs were broadcast during the 1950s on WAGA, WLTV, and WSB-TV. Many of the local musicians turned to bluegrass music, started other careers, or pursued their careers in Nashville.  \n## Decline as a center  \nGradually, after the 1930s, Nashville became the capital of country music. In addition, Atlanta's aspirations to more \"upscale\" arts discouraged both the hillbilly band and blues scenes. From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, Atlantans supported a thriving live country music scene, but the city no longer was a major center of music recording. White flight eventually transformed Atlanta into a majority-black city that had largely abandoned Southern cultural hallmarks such as country music.  \n## Artists 1920s-1950s  \nNotable musicians active in the 1920s-1950s Atlanta scene include:  \n* Fiddlin' John Carson  \n* Gid Tanner and his Skillet Lickers  \n* John Dilleshaw  \n* Bud Landress  \n* Georgia Yellow Hammers  \n* Bill Chitwood  \n* Charles E. Moody  \n* Charles Mitchell (songwriter)  \n* Earl Johnson (fiddler)  \n* Phil Reeve  \n* Jimmie Rodgers who recorded \"Waiting for a Train\" in Atlanta in 1928  \n* Andrew and Jim Baxter  \n* Bill Lowery  \n* Robert Morland Stanley  \n## Later and current artists  \nLater country artists active in Atlanta included Jerry Reed and Kenny Rogers.  \nToday, Metro Atlanta is home to Alan Jackson, Jason Aldean, Zac Brown Band, Sugarland, Ray Stevens and Travis Tritt.\n\nQuestion: Which individual played a significant role in the early country music scene in Atlanta during the 1920s, as mentioned in the accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

His district, which was once represented by former Senator Connie Mack III and former CIA Director Porter Goss, serves most of the heart of Southwest Florida, including Cape Coral, Fort Myers, Bonita Springs, Estero, and Naples.  \nBorn and raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Donalds attended Florida A&M University and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance and marketing from Florida State University in 2002. Before entering politics, Donalds worked in the finance, insurance, and banking industries.  Donalds represented the 80th district in the Florida House of Representatives from 2016 to 2020.  \nDonalds was elected to Congress in 2020, defeating Democratic nominee Cindy Banyai. In the January 2023 Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives election, Donalds received enough Republican votes to deny Kevin McCarthy the speakership in the fourth through 11th rounds of voting. Donalds was a candidate in the third nomination for the October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election.  \nIdeologically positioned on the hard right flank of the Republican Party, he was a member of the Tea Party movement and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. In January 2021, Donalds voted to object to the certification of electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election. Donalds has repeatedly claimed that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president of the United States.  \n## Early life and education  \nDonalds was born and raised in the Crown Heights neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. One of three children, he was raised by his single mother. In 1996, Donalds graduated from Nazareth Regional High School in East Flatbush. He attended Florida A&M University and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance and marketing from Florida State University in 2002.  \nIn 1997, Donalds was arrested for marijuana distribution; the charges were dropped as part of a pre-trial diversion program. In 2000, he pleaded no contest to a felony bribery charge as part of a scheme to defraud a bank. His record was later sealed and expunged.  \n## Career  \n<image>Donalds and President Donald Trump in 2019 with a former inmate freed by the First Step Act\nDonalds began his professional career in 2003 as a credit analyst at TIB Bank. He was promoted to senior credit analyst in 2004, and later promoted to commercial credit manager, assistant vice president, and credit manager. Donalds left TIB Bank in 2007 and took a position as a portfolio manager at CMG Surety LLC. In 2015, he joined Wells Fargo Advisors as a Financial Advisor.  \nAfter Donalds became involved in the Tea Party movement, he was encouraged to run for office.  \nIn 2012, Donalds was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Florida's 19th congressional district. He finished fifth of six candidates. In 2014, he was reported as a likely candidate for the U.S. House in Florida's 19th congressional district after Trey Radel resigned, but did not run.  \nDonalds was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016. During his Florida House tenure, he chaired the Insurance and Banking Subcommittee.\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives  \n### Elections  \n#### 2020  \n<image>Donalds being sworn in by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\nDonalds was the Republican nominee for Florida's 19th congressional district in the 2020 election, running to succeed retiring incumbent Francis Rooney. He won a crowded nine-way Republican primary by 770 votes over State Representative Dane Eagle, finishing just over the threshold to avoid a recount. Republicans have a 550,000-voter advantage over Democrats in registration, and Florida Gulf Coast University professor Peter Bergerson noted that the Republican primary is almost always the real contest for most races in the area. In August 2020, anonymous text messages were sent out to constituents in the 19th district claiming that Donalds was dropping out of the race. Donalds later clarified via tweet that he was not dropping out and called the messages \"illegal\".  \nDuring his campaign, Donalds described himself as a \"Trump supporting, gun owning, liberty loving, pro-life, politically incorrect Black man.\" He stated his support for economic freedom, clean water, nuclear power and decreased government involvement in health care. He opposed the Green New Deal.  \nIn the November general election, Donalds defeated Democratic nominee Cindy Banyai. Donalds said he would focus on policy related to water quality in Southwest Florida. Upon his swearing-in on January 3, 2021, Donalds became the sixth person to represent this district since its creation in 1983 (it had been the 13th District from 1983 to 1993, the 14th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 19th since 2013).\n\n### Tenure in Congress  \nIn late 2020, Donalds was identified as a participant in the \"Freedom Force\", a group of incoming House Republicans who \"say they’re fighting against socialism in America\". The following year Donalds was blocked from joining the Congressional Black Caucus.  \n#### 2020 Election  \nIn January 2021, Donalds voted to object to the certification of electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election. Donalds has since claimed that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president of the United States, a claim he repeated in a Vanity Fair interview in July 2023.  \n#### Iraq  \nIn June 2021, Donalds was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.  \n#### Syria  \nIn 2023, Donalds was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.  \n#### January 2023 Speaker of the House election  \nOn January 3, 2023, Donalds received one vote in the 118th Congress's first election for Speaker of the House, from Chip Roy. Donalds voted for Kevin McCarthy on the first two ballots, then for Jim Jordan on the third. On January 4, on the fourth ballot, Roy nominated Donalds for Speaker, and he received 20 votes. This marked the first time two Black lawmakers were nominated for Speaker. He was nominated by Lauren Boebert on the fifth ballot, and again received 20 votes. He was sequentially nominated by Scott Perry, Dan Bishop, Andy Biggs, Matt Rosendale, and Anna Paulina Luna on the sixth to tenth ballots. He was not nominated on the 11th ballot, but still received 12 votes. Donalds switched his vote back to McCarthy after House Republican leadership made many concessions to House Freedom Caucus members.  \n#### October 2023 candidacy for Speaker  \nDonalds is a candidate for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in the October 2023 election.  \n#### Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023  \nDonalds was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.  \n#### Israel  \nDonalds voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.  \n### Committee assignments  \nFor the 118th Congress:  \n* Committee on Financial Services  \n* * Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion  \n* * Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy  \n* Committee on Oversight and Accountability  \n* * Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs  \n* * Subcommittee on Government Operations and the Federal Workforce  \n### Caucus memberships  \n* Freedom Caucus  \n* Republican Study Committee  \n## Electoral history  \n### 2016  \n### 2018  \n### 2020  \n### 2022  \n## Personal life  \nDonalds and his wife, Erika, have three sons.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# University of ancient Taxila  \nThe University of ancient Takshashila refers to the city of Takṣaśilā (तक्षशिला) (Taxila, modern-day Pakistan) near the bank of the Indus River as a centre of education in religious and secular topics. It started as a Brahmanical seat of learning; while in the early centuries CE it became  a prominent centre of Buddhist scholarship as well.ps= \"In the early centuries the centre of Buddhist scholarship was the University of Taxila.\"  \n## Early history of Taxila  \nAccording to the Ramayana, the city was founded by Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, and younger half brother of Lord Rama. Bharata then assigned his son Taksha to rule the city. The earliest archaeological remains of the site go back to 6th century BC. It became the capital of the Achaemenid territories in northwestern Ancient India following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley around 540 BCE. Taxila was at the crossroad of the main trade roads of Asia, and was probably populated by Persians, Greeks, Scythians and many ethnicities coming from the various parts of the Achaemenid Empire.  \n## University  \nAccording to John Marshall, Taxila emerged as a centre of learning after the Persian conquests due it's geographical position, \"at the North-Western gateway of the subcontinent,\" and the \"cosmopolitan character of her population.\" It started as a Brahmanical seat of learning. According to Frazier and Flood, the highly systemized Vedic model of learning helped establish large institutions such as Nalanda, Taxila and Vikramashila. These universities not only taught Vedic texts and the ritual but also the different theoretical disciplines associated with the limbs or the sciences of the Vedas, which included disciplines such as linguistics, law, astronomy and reasoning.  \nThe university was particularly renowned for science, especially medicine, and the arts, but both religious and secular subjects were taught, and even subject such as archery or astrology in hindu world.  \nAccording to John Marshall, \"In early Buddhist literature, paricularly in the Jatakas, Taxila is frequently mentioned as a university centre where students could get instruction in almost any subject, religious or secular, from the Veda to mathematics and medicine, even to astrology and archery.\" The role of Taxila as a center of knowledge grew stronger under the Maurya Empire and Greek rule (Indo-Greeks) in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. In the early centuries CE it was a prominent centre of Buddhist scholarship as well.ps= \"In the early centuries the centre of Buddhist scholarship was the University of Taxila.\"  \nIt was not a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in Bihar.  \nThe destruction by Toramana in the 5th century CE seem to have put an end to the activities of Taxila as a centre of learning.  \n## Teachers  \nInfluential teachers that are said to have taught at university of Taxila include:  \n* Pāṇini, the great 5th century BCE Indian grammarian  \n* Chanakya, the influential Prime Minister of the founder of the Mauryan Empire, Chandragupta Maurya, is also said to have been teaching at Taxila.  \n* Kumāralāta, according to the 3rd century Chinese Buddhist monk and traveller Yuan Chwang, Kumāralāta, the founder of Sautrāntika school was also an excellent teacher at Taxila university and attracted students from as far as China.  \n## Students  \n<image>Students with their oblong palettes used for writing, in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara. The young Buddha accompanying them to go to school is also part of the complete scene. 2nd-3rd century CE, Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\n<image>Bhir Mound, excavation of ancient buildings.\nAccording to Stephen Batchelor, the Buddha may have been influenced by the experiences and knowledge acquired by some of his closest followers in the foreign capital of Taxila. Several contemporaries, and close followers, of the Buddha are said to have studied in Taxila, namely:  \n* King Pasenadi of Kosala, a close friend of the Buddha,  \n* Bandhula, the commander of Pasedani's army  \n* Aṅgulimāla, a close follower of the Buddha. A Buddhist story about Aṅgulimāla (also called Ahiṃsaka, and later a close follower of Buddha), relates how his parents sent him to Taxila to study under a well-known teacher. There he excels in his studies and becomes the teacher's favorite student, enjoying special privileges in his teacher's house. However, the other students grow jealous of Ahiṃsaka's speedy progress and seek to turn his master against him.1960 To that end, they make it seem as though Ahiṃsaka has seduced the master's wife.  \n* Jivaka, court doctor at Rajagriha and personal doctor of the Buddha.  \n* Charaka, the Indian \"father of medicine\" and one of the leading authorities in Ayurveda, is also said to have studied at Taxila, and practiced there.  \n* Chandragupta Maurya, Buddhist literature states that Chandragupta Maurya, the future founder of the Mauryan Empire, though born near Patna (Bihar) in Magadha, was taken by Chanakya for his training and education to Taxila, and had him educated there in \"all the sciences and arts\" of the period, including military sciences. There he studied for eight years. The Greek and Hindu texts also state that Kautilya (Chanakya) was a native of the northwest Indian subcontinent, and Chandragupta was his resident student for eight years. These accounts match Plutarch's assertion that Alexander the Great met with the young Chandragupta while campaigning in the Punjab.\n\n\nQuestion: Which individual associated with the historical Buddha is said to have studied in Taxila, according to the description provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

Angelosetti primarily worked for Chikara, where he is a former Grand Champion, a former one-time Campeon de Parejas and a Young Lions Cup Champion. Angelosetti has also worked for other independent promotions, including Beyond Wrestling and  Wrestling is Fun!. His gimmick was that of a football player.  \n## Professional wrestling career  \n### Chikara (2012–2019)  \nIn March, Archibald Peck's valet, Veronica had begun showing interest in Angelosetti, breaking off the relationship between herself and Peck.  Both men started a feud to prove to Veronica who is the toughest.  Peck changed his gimmick to Mixed Martial Archie, using MMA during his matches. They fought at \"I'll Be a Mummy's Uncle\", which Mark won via DQ due to Archie being disqualified for excessive punishment, after refusing to stop ground-and-pounding.   After the match Veronica walked out with Mark and started to flirt with him. On June 2 at Chikara's second internet pay-per-view, Chikarasaurus Rex: How to Hatch a Dinosaur, The Throwbacks defeated the team of Mixed Martial Archie and Colt Cabana in a match where the man who received the pinfall, must leave Chikara. While the referee was distracted, Mark hit Archie with his helmet and Hatfield pinned him for the win. Following the match, Veronica kissed her new boyfriend Angelosetti, while the dejected Archie walked out of the arena.  \nOn June 24, 2012, Angelosetti entered in the Chikara Young Lions Cup X tournament, defeating Jason Axe, Ryan Rush and Tripp Cassidy in the first round. Angelosetti defeated Anthony Stone on August 17, 2012 and defeated A. C. H. in the finals, winning the Young Lions Cup.

On June 2, 2013, Angelosetti retained the Young Lions Cup against Saturyne at Aniversario: Never Compromise. Following the event, Chikara went on a break (and the Cup was deactivated), which lasted until May 2014. On July 20, Angelosetti and Dasher Hatfield defeated the Pieces of Hate (Jigsaw and The Shard) to win the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas. In September, Angelosetti and Hatfield teamed up with Chikara Grand Champion Icarus as the Golden Trio for the 2014 King of Trios.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Marriage coin charm  \n<image>A group of Chinese sex education coins, each showing four different sexual positions.\nMarriage coin charms ( links=yes) are a category of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese numismatic charms that depict marriage, harmonious, and/or sexual imagery. These coin charms often imitate the design of Chinese cash coins, but can exist in many different shapes and sizes.\n\n## Names  \nMarriage coin charms are known by many names, including secret play coins (Traditional Chinese: 秘戲錢; Simplified Chinese: 秘戏钱; Pinyin: mì xì qián), secret fun coins, hide (evade) the fire (of lust) coins (Traditional Chinese: 避火錢; Simplified Chinese: 避火钱; Pinyin: bì huǒ qián), Chinese marriage coins, Chinese love coins, Chinese spring money (Traditional Chinese: 春錢; Simplified Chinese: 春钱; Pinyin: chūn qián), Chinese erotic coins, and Chinese wedding coins.  \n## Types and themes  \nMarriage coin charms can display various symbols related to marriage. They may depict dates and peanuts symbolising the wish for reproduction, lotus seeds symbolising \"continuous births\", chestnuts symbolising male offspring, pomegranates symbolising fertility, brans symbolising sons that will be successful, \"dragon and phoenix\" candles, cypress leaves, qilins, bronze mirrors, shoes, saddles, and other things associated with traditional Chinese weddings. Since ancient times, three of the most important events that could occur in the life of a Chinese person in accordance to traditional Chinese culture were success in the imperial examination, which would result in a government position as well as the prestige and wealth that is associated with it, getting married, and having a large number male offspring to carry out the proper duties of filial piety and ancestor worship which were all proscribed to these sons by the Confucian system.  \n### Dragon and Fenghuang charms  \n<image>A Zhengde Tongbao (正德通寶) fantasy cash coin charm featuring the image of a dragon and a fenghuang on its reverse.\nA number of marriage numismatic charms depict the image of a dragon and a fenghuang on their reverse sides, usually the obverse sides of these amulets often contain a cash coin inscription, fantasy cash coin inscription, or a more auspicious inscription related to either marriage or having plenty.  \nZhengde Tongbao (正德通寶) fantasy cash coin charms commonly feature the image of a dragon and a fenghuang on their reverses, when a Chinese dragon and fenghuang are shown together they often symbolise the union of a man and a woman meaning that these Zhengde Tongbao charms were used as Chinese marriage charms. Although Gary Ashkenazy claims that the dragon and fenghuang symbolises matrimony, it is argued by Edgar J. Mandel in his book Metal Charms and Amulets of China that the dragon and fenghuang actually represent the power of the imperial Chinese government where the dragon represents the Emperor and the fenghuang the Empress. A popular saying in imperial China was \"If a household has a Zhengde coin, there will be material wealth and honour for ten thousand years\" (家有正德錢富貴萬萬年, jiā yǒu zhèng dé qián fù guì wàn wàn nián).  \nSome dragon and fenghuang charms display the obverse inscription Zhouyuan Tongbao (周元通寶), which is an inscription used by Later Zhou. Although most of the numismatic charms that display this inscription are produced during a later period, charms with this inscription are very popular throughout Chinese history. In 956, Chai Rong, also known as Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou, had ordered that the bronze Buddha statues in the Buddhist temples, as well as all the bronze items which were owned by the people of the Later Zhou Empire, had to be turned in to the imperial government. These bronze items were confiscated in order to manufacture Later Zhou cash coins. Because Buddhist statues were used to produce these cash coins it is believed by some people that Zhouyuan Tongbao cash coins were especially auspicious, which is why they later became a very popular design for later made Chinese numismatic charms.\n\n### Fenghua Xueyue (\"Wind, Flowers, Snow, Moon\")  \nThe most common inscriptions that is found on Chinese love charms is Fenghua Xueyue (風花雪月) which literally translate to mean \"wind, flowers, snow and moon\". The expression used in this inscription is most likely intentionally obscure which makes it to be open to various interpretations. The expression Fenghua Xueyue is generally used in China in order to describe a happy and lively place, or could be used to describe something that is either frivolous or trivial. One of the more plausible explanations for the phrase Fenghua Xueyue appearing on marriage numismatic charms is that each word in this context is used to represent a different Chinese goddess.  \nThe inscription may also be a reference to the 4 volume Chinese erotic novel entitled Su'e pian (素娥篇) made during the late Ming dynasty period (which was written around 1640). The erotic novel describes the romantic adventures of a man named Wu Sansi (武三思), an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang dynasty and his aunt Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty, and a concubine who was described as being \"beautiful\" named Su E (素娥). The woman Su E is sometimes also referred to as the \"Lady of the Moon\". In the novel Wu Sansi and Su E are inspired to have sex in a variety of natural settings using 43 different sexual positions, which were all illustrated wood engravings that accompany the text of the novel.  \n### Fish  \nA design of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese marriage amulets display a pair of fish on one side and the inscription Yu Shuang (魚双; Korean: Eo ssang; Vietnamese: Ngư Song, \"Pair of Fish\") on the other side. In various Oriental cultures fish are associated with plenty and abundance. Fish are furthermore noted for their prolific ability to reproduce and that when they swim that this was in joy and are therefore associated with a happy and harmonious marriage. In Feng Shui, a pair of fish are associated with conjugal bliss and the joys of being in a matrimonial union.  \n### Geese  \nAmong the various types of Chinese marriage charms are those that use Chinese zodiac animals as well as other animals in combination to symbolise a harmonious matrimony. For example, a Song dynasty period brass charm that is 51 millimeters in diameter with geese features all the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac in a circle on one side and wild geese on the other side. The geese on this amulet symbolise marital fidelity because of the legend that geese are monogamous and remain together for life. During marriage ceremonies in ancient China, libations were made to the geese when the bride arrived at her husband's home. This tradition goes back to antiquity: at that time, a goose was offered to the bride. This amulet also features an image of a lotus flower, which feeds the goose and reinforces the symbolism of happy union because of the homophony with the character lian, \"to unite\", \"together\". This particular type of amulet was offered at weddings.  \n### Sex education coins  \nA Fenghua Xueyue (風花雪月) sex education cash coin.  \nSome marriage coin charms illustrate how the newlywed couple should perform on their wedding night to meet their responsibilities and obligations to produce children. In the case of these coins, \"charm\" in this context is a catchall term for coin-shaped items which were not official (or counterfeit) money. However, these numismatic objects were necessarily considered \"magical\" or \"lucky\", as some of these Chinese numismatic charms can be used as \"mnemonic coins\".  \nSex acts were traditionally only scarcely depicted in Chinese art but stone carvings from the Han dynasty showcasing sexual intercourse were found and bronze mirrors with various sexual themes were common during the Tang dynasty. It was also during the Tang dynasty that coins graphically depicting sex started being produced. Chinese love charms often have the inscription \"wind, flowers, snow and moon\" (風花雪月) which is an obscure verse referring to a happy and frivolous setting, although every individual character might also be used to identify a Chinese goddess or the \"Seven Fairy Maidens\" (七仙女). Other Chinese wedding charms often have inscriptions like  fēng huā yí rén (風花宜人), míng huáng yù yǐng (明皇禦影), and lóng fèng chéng yàng (龍鳳呈樣).  \nThese charms could also be used in brothels where a traveller could use the illustrations to make a request of a prostitute without knowing the local language.  \nA common design for Korean marriage charms displays scenes of a heterosexual couple engaging in different positions of sexual intercourse.  \n### \"Song of Unending Sorrow\" charms  \n\"Song of Unending Sorrow\" charms, or \"Song of Unending Regret\" charms, are a common type of marriage coin charm, that might be Chinese, Japanese, Korean Taiwanese, or Vietnamese in origin, that depict part of the 9th century poem Chang hen ge written by Bai Juyi. \"Song of Unending Sorrow\" charms display four heterosexual couples having sex in various positions (or they are supposed to represent one couple having in four different positions) in the area surrounding the square centre hole of the coin. Surrounding the couples having sex are the Chinese characters representing the spring (春), wind (風), peaches (桃), and plums (李), which is a reference to the first four characters of a line from the Chang hen ge poem which translates into English as \"Gone were the breezy spring days when the peach and plum trees were in bloom\" in reference to the death of Yang Guifei.  \n### Spring  \nMarriage coin charms are sometimes referred to as \"spring money\" (春錢) or \"spring coins\" in refers to an ancient Chinese springtime ritual where young boys and young girls would be separated from each other by a stream and would then sing love songs to towards the other gender on the other side of the stream. This ancient tradition is still practiced by a number of ethnic minorities in China today.  \n### Vietnamese marriage charms  \nVietnamese marriage amulets often display dragon (龍) and phoenix (鳳) motifs, this is because the Vietnamese dragon is often used as a symbol for males, while the Phượng Hoàng (or \"phoenix\") is used to represent females. When the phoenix is shown together with the dragon this is often meant as a metaphor for the Emperor and Empress.  \nSome marriage amulets have the obverse inscription Trường Mạng Phú Quý (長命富貴) written in seal script, which translates into English to \"Long life, riches, and honour\". This inscription symbolises good fortune in marriage as well as protection. There are also some Vietnamese marriage amulets with the inscription Thọ Sơn Phúc Hải (壽山福海, \"longevity,  \nmountain, happiness, and sea\"), which is a part of a Chinese congratulatory phrase \"May your age be as Mount Tai and your happiness as the Eastern Sea\" (壽比南山福如東海).  \nSome Vietnamese marriage amulets contain the Daoist Âm and Dương symbol (or Thái cực đồ), this is because in Daoist Âm symbolises the feminine and Dương symbolises the masculine. Further symbols may include the lotus flower, known as \"荷\" (Hà) or \"蓮\" (Sen). In Mandarin Chinese the word for \"lotus\" has a homonymous sound with the word which means \"to bind\" as in a marriage contract, \"to love\", and \"to be modest\".  \n## List of marriage coin charms by inscription  \nList of marriage coin charms by inscription:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# The Subtle Body  \nThe Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America is a 2010 book on the history of yoga as exercise by the American journalist Stefanie Syman.  \nIt spans the period from the first precursors of American yoga, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau, the arrival of Vivekananda, the role of Hollywood with Indra Devi, the hippie generation, and the leaders of a revived but now postural yoga such as Bikram Choudhury and Pattabhi Jois.  \nSeveral critics gave the book positive reviews, praising its wide range and readability; other critics gave it mixed reviews, noting its strengths, but also its lack of a strong continuous argument and its tendency to gossip.  \n## Synopsis  \n<image>Swami Vivekananda at the Parliament of the World's Religions (1893)\nSyman begins The Subtle Body by describing in turn the precursors of American yoga, namely Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau. She notes that Emerson's 1856 poem Brahma concisely introduced Hindu nondualism, repudiating \"sacraments, supernaturalism, biblical authority, and... Christianity\". Thoreau, she states, tried to practice yoga, and was seen by some as \"the first American Yogi\", but by others as \"a misanthropic hermit\". However, Syman identifies the dramatic arrival of Vivekananda and his Raja Yoga as marking the start of modern yoga, and the key moment in this as being his appearance at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago.  \nFrom there, she presents the showman Pierre Bernard and his relative Theos Bernard, including sections detailing Pierre confusing yoga with tantric sex, complete with \"lust, mummery, and black magic\", and of Theos telling a carefully fictionalised account of his experiences with Hatha Yoga in India and Tibet.  \nThe book then includes stories about a variety of straighter advocates of yoga. Syman tells the story of Margaret Woodrow Wilson, daughter of American president Woodrow Wilson, writing how she \"turned Hindu\" after she \"found peace\" in Sri Aurobindo's ashram in Pondicherry. A Hollywood connection is then explored, featuring Prabhavananda, who translated the Bhagavad Gita; Aldous Huxley; Alan Watts; and Indra Devi. The books explains how Devi came to America, unknown, having learnt yoga directly from Krishnamacharya, and how she had grown up in pre-revolutionary Russia, escaping to Berlin and going to India with her diplomat husband. It also tells of the times that Devi taught many celebrity pupils, including Greta Garbo and Gloria Swanson; in a review, Sarah Schrank notes that Syman is interested in how \"American fans, often rich and female\", made suitable environments for yoga to spread, \"shaping celebrity gurus in the process\".  \nThen Syman gives her view that, in the 1960s, the yoga scene was dominated by celebrity gurus, whether from India like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi with his Transcendental Meditation, or home-grown like the \"psychedelic sages\" Ram Dass (aka Richard Alpert) and Timothy Leary, both at one time Harvard professors. It then tells how they were followed, towards the end of the 1960s, by Indian gurus of postural yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, founder of the precise Iyengar Yoga, and Vishnudevananda, founder of the more overtly spiritual Sivananda Yoga, along with Swami Satchidananda, giving the story of how the Swami made the crowds chant \"Hari Om, Rama Rama\" at the 1969 Woodstock Festival.  \nThe book ends with an account of the gurus of more energetic forms of yoga, in particular Bikram Choudhury and Pattabhi Jois.\n\n## Publication  \nThe Subtle Body was published as a hardback book by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux in New York in 2010.  \nThe book is illustrated with 25 monochrome plates, including portraits of many of the people described. Other illustrations are of the chakras from Arthur Avalon in 1919; a circus program from 1929 showing yoga-like contortions; the Hollywood Vedanta Temple; a naked woman in Laghuvajrasana, a back bend, at the Esalen Institute in 1972; and the Sri Ganesha Temple in Ashtanga Yoga New York in 2009.  \n## Reception  \nSeveral critics gave The Subtle Body positive reviews, praising its wide range and readability. Other critics gave the book mixed reviews, noting its strengths, but also its lack of a strong continuous argument, its preference for colourful stories, and its tendency to gossip.  \nOne of the warmest receptions came in the New York Journal of Books from novelist Norman Powers. He calls Subtle Body \"wide-ranging, flexible in its outlook, and satisfying in its inclusiveness, even if Ms. Syman never really defines what, exactly, yoga is.\" In his view, the result is \"really a cultural history of the United States\"; Powers notes Syman's statement that yoga \"is one of the first and most successful products of globalization\", and observes that in America it helped to weave an isolationist population \"into the fabric of the larger world\". The scholar of Eastern religions Thomas Forsthoefel almost entirely agreed with Powers in his review of the book for Nova Religio, in which he called it \"a compelling account of the complex social and philosophical interface\" created by yoga's arrival in America, also describing it as mainly a social history.  \nForsthoefel, though, sees the book's strength as Syman's storytelling, which he says provides \"key snapshots both of the sweep of yoga's evolution in America and of the lives of key figures\" in that process, so that the book reads \"almost like a novel\". The readability has been noted by academics, too: the historian Sarah Schrank, writing in American Studies, calls Subtle Body \"highly readable\" as it traces the various \"transmutations\" of yoga in America. Bob Weisenberg, writing in Elephant Journal, states that the book \"reads like a thriller\" and is \"so entertaining it clearly has an audience outside the Yoga world\".  \n<image>Pierre Bernard, a major figure in the book, pictured in Ardha Padmasana (half lotus) in an article titled \"Prizefighter Trains by Yoga Methods\", Life magazine, 1939\nAmong the most critical was the historian Jared Farmer. Writing in Reviews in American History, he calls the book relatively vivid but \"inconstant\", switching between journalistic, historical, creative, and critical writing styles. Further, in his view it \"lacks a strong argument\" and \"privileges the most colorful stories\". The most extreme of those is Syman's longest chapter, on Pierre Bernard, with Farmer writing that it \"includes bizarre love triangles, menage a trois, tantric sex, Vanderbilt heiresses, private detectives, spies, circus elephants, baseball, and heavyweight boxing.\" Though Farmer notes how Syman successfully illustrates the importance of women in shaping yoga in America, particularly Indra Devi, he affirms that today's yoga did not come straight from Devi; he instead asserts that, in the 1960s, modern yoga split into a mind-oriented stream with Transcendental Meditation and the Hare Krishnas, and a body-oriented stream with Iyengar. These are covered variously in other parts of the book.  \nIn another review, the literary critic Michiko Kakutani, writing in The New York Times, states that Syman deftly traces how Emerson and Thoreau enabled yoga to take root in America, providing a \"lively gallery of larger-than-life characters\" in the story of American yoga. Kakutani notes Syman's many \"entertaining anecdotes\" but states that the book fails to cover either yoga's ancient history or to show how the various schools of yoga evolved. Almost entirely disagreeing with Kakytani, Claire Dederer, writing in Slate, calls the book an \"exhaustive historical survey\". She notes that Syman writes of Devi that to her, yoga refers only to the asanas, calling this \"a turning point... from esoteric pursuit to health-giving practice available to all.\" In Dederer's view, Syman \"does a wonderful job of showing how yoga, like a virus, has kept evolving in order to survive\", but all the same Dederer wonders if Syman wasn't trying too hard. Similarly, Tara Katir, writing in Hinduism Today, states that Subtle Body \"proceeds systematically\", and is \"engaging, if at times a bit gossipy.\"\n\n\nQuestion: Which historical figure is credited with marking the start of modern yoga with his appearance at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, according to the descriptions provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Itinerant groups in Europe  \n<image>A showman's wagon, used for accommodation and transportation\nThere are a number of traditionally itinerant or travelling groups in Europe who are known as \"Travellers\" or \"Gypsies\". The origins of the indigenous itinerant groups are unclear. They have been assumed to have taken up the travelling lifestyle out of necessity at some point during the Early Modern period but to not be ethnically distinct from their source population. However, recent DNA testing has shown that the Irish Travellers are of Irish origin but are genetically distinct from their settled counterparts due to social isolation, and more groups are being studied.  \nMany groups speak their own language or dialect (distinct from the settled population); it is often a blend of the local settled language and Romani language, even in non-Romani groups. The largest of these groups are the Romani people, who have Indian roots and heritage, who left India around 1,500 years ago entering Europe around 1,000 years ago; this includes the Sinti people, who are themselves the second largest group. The third largest group in Europe is the Yenish, an indigenous Germanic group. As opposed to nomads who travel with and subsist on herds of livestock, itinerant groups traditionally travel for trade or other work for the sedentary populations amongst which they live.\n\n## Indigenous Dutch Travellers (Woonwagenbewoners)  \nIndigenous Dutch Travellers, known in the Netherlands as lang|nl|woonwagenbewoners (caravan dwellers), were first recorded as a population in the 1879 census, but have existed since the advent of industrial mechanization in the first half of the 19th century. They travelled around in search of employment and practised traditional professions like chair bottomers, tinsmiths, broom binders, traders, peddlers, artisans, etc. As of 2018, some 30,000–60,000 Travellers live in the Netherlands, most of whom are Catholics living in the south of the country. Many Travellers used to speak the cant language lang|nl|Bargoens and a derivative sociolect continues to exist.  \nLiving in trailer parks or \"caravan camps\" gave rise to the pejorative name kampers to refer to Dutch Travellers, while the latter prefer to call themselves reizigers (travellers). In turn, Travellers have used the terms lang|nl|burger and lang|nl|kaffer against those who live in regular housing. Similar to indigenous Norwegian Travellers, Dutch and Flemish Travellers are theorised to have Yenish (German) admixture.  \n## Indigenous Flemish Travellers (Voyageurs)  \nare an indigenous Flemish group who are related to the Dutch Travellers. The first voyageurs slept in stables and barns they encountered in the countryside along the way. It was only later that they started building covered wagons, a simple cart with a tarpaulin over it, which they pulled themselves or for which they harnessed some dogs. Even later the horses came, and the hood carts grew into caravans.  \nThese voyageurs had their example in the nomadic way of life of mainly the Sinti. They partially adopted each other's customs, and mixed marriages were not uncommon. From this mixture of Romani and Western culture, a subculture of their own has emerged. Many also currently live in houses, which makes tracking them difficult. In addition, some are at such an advanced stage of integration into sedentary society that they do not know or deny that they are descendants of voyageurs, ashamed of an ancestor who walked from door to door. Their number is currently estimated at 8,000, but could be much higher. They are spread all over Flanders.  \n## Indigenous Norwegian Travellers (Skøyere/Fantefolk)  \nIndigenous Norwegian Travellers (more commonly known as Fanter, Fantefolk or Skøyere) are an itinerant group who call themselves Reisende. Confusingly, this term is also used by lang|rmg|Romanisæl, the Romani group of Norway and Sweden. Unlike the Romanisæl Travellers, the indigenous Norwegian Travellers are non-Romani by culture and origins, and they do not speak any form of Romani language. Instead, their language is 'Rodi', which is a Norwegian dialect.  \nSimilar to indigenous Dutch and Flemish Travellers, indigenous Norwegian Travellers are theorised to have Yenish (German Traveller) admixture and possibly could be descended from them. Norwegian Rodi includes a large proportion of Yenish loanwords. Rodi also has a handful of Scandoromani loanwords due to Romanisæl Travellers and indigenous Norwegian Travellers both living in close proximity to each other.  \nIndigenous Norwegian Travellers have always concentrated around Southern and Southwestern Norway along the coastline (which was separated from the rest of Norway due to mountains) and Romanisæl Travellers have always concentrated around Central Norway (specifically in Trøndelag county around the city of Trondheim). Historically, both groups have travelled all over, and often overlap into each other's traditional areas.  \nThey are known to the settled majority population as fant or fanter, but they prefer the term reisende ('travellers'). This term is also used by Romanisæl Travellers (the largest population of Romani people in Norway and Sweden), though the two groups are distinct. There are also groups in German-speaking countries who refer to themselves as reisende, which is German for 'travellers'. Eilert Sundt, a 19th-century sociologist, termed the indigenous Travellers småvandrer or småvandringer ('small travellers'), to contrast them with the Romanisæl (Tater) Travellers, which Sundt called storvandrer or storvandringer ('great travellers') who ranged further in their journeys.  \n## Irish Travellers (Pavee)  \nBy DNA, the Pavees are Irish, but have a separate language and culture than the settled Irish. They live predominantly in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Travellers refer to themselves as Mincéirí or Pavees in their own language or in Irish as an Lucht Siúil, meaning literally \"the walking people\". The language of the Irish Travellers, Shelta, is mainly based on an Irish lexicon and an English grammar. There are two dialects of this language: Gammon (or Gamin) and Cant. It has been dated back to the eighteenth century but may be older. The vast majority of Irish Travellers are Roman Catholics who maintain their traditions and culture in a close knit community of families.  \nIn 2011, an analysis of DNA from 40 Travellers showed that Irish Travellers are a distinct Indigenous Irish ethnic minority who separated from the settled Irish community at least 1,000 years ago; the claim was made that they are as distinct from the settled community as Icelanders are from Norwegians.  \nLike other itinerant groups they have often been racially discriminated against in the past and still are today. They were only recognised as an official ethnic group in the Republic of Ireland on March 1, 2017.  \n## Northern Romani Travellers  \nNorthern Romani Traveller groups include:  \n* Romanichal Travellers in England (As well as North East Wales, South Wales and the Scottish Borders), with diaspora communities in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  \n* Welsh Kale Travellers in the Welsh-speaking parts of Northwestern Wales.  \n* Scottish Lowland Travellers in Lowland Scotland.  \n* Romanisæl Travellers in Central Norway and Sweden.  \n* Finnish Kale in Finland and parts of Sweden.  \nThese groups have much European blood due to mixing with Indigenous Traveller groups (British Romani Travellers mix with Irish Travellers, Scottish Highland Travellers and Funfair Traveller and Scandinavian Romani Travellers mix with Indigenous Norwegian Travellers) and even non-Travellers over the centuries. This has led to these Romani groups generally looking White in appearance.  \nIt is also a reason why these groups speak mixed languages rather than more pure forms of Romani:  \n* Romanichal Travellers speak Angloromani (A mix of English and Romani).  \n* Romanisæl Travellers speak Scandoromani (A mix of Norwegian, Swedish and Romani).  \n* Scottish Lowland Travellers speak Scottish Cant (A mix of Scots and Romani).  \n* Welsh Kale speak Kalá (A mix of Welsh, English and Romani).  \n* Finnish Kale speak Kalo (A mix of Finnish and Romani).  \n## Romani/Gypsies  \n<image>Sinti Romanies in the Rhineland, 1935\nThe best known itinerant community are the Romani people (also Romany, Romanies Tzigani, Rromani, and variants).  \nThe Romani have Indo-Aryan roots and heritage and first entered Europe via the Middle East around a thousand years ago. They spread further through Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, separating into various subgroups in the process.  \nThey speak Romani, an Indo-Aryan language.\n\n## Indigenous Scottish Highland Travellers  \nScottish Highland Travellers are also known as Ceardannan in Scottish Gaelic (which means \"the craftsmen\" or 'Black Tinkers') or more poetically as the \"Summer Walkers\".  \nThe Highland Traveller community has a long history in Scotland going back on record to at least the 12th century. Historically they would travel from village to village and would pitch their bow-tents on rough ground around the edge of a village and would earn money there as tinsmiths, hawkers, horse dealers or pearl-fishermen. Many found seasonal employment on farms, e.g. doing berry picking or during harvests. Nowadays the majority of Highland Travellers have settled down into organized campsites or regular houses.  \nThe Scottish Highland Travellers have their own (nearly extinct) language based on Scottish Gaelic called Beurla Reagaird.  \nHighland Travellers are closely tied to their native Highlands and the native Gaelic speaking population; they may follow an itinerant or a settled lifestyle. They have played an essential role in the preservation of traditional Gaelic culture. Travellers' outstanding contribution to Highland life has been as custodians of an ancient and vital Gaelic singing, storytelling and folklore tradition of great importance. It is estimated that there are only 2,000 Highland Travellers leading their traditional lifestyle.  \n## Yenish Travellers  \n<image>Two Jenische in Muotathal, Switzerland, 1890\nIn German-speaking Europe, France and Wallonia, there are the Yenish people (Jenische or Yeniche in German and French spelling, respectively).  \nAn early description of this group was published by Johann Ulrich Schöll in 1793.\n\n## Funfair Travellers (Showmen)  \nShowmen, also known as Funfair Travellers or Travelling Showpeople, are the members of families who own travelling funfairs and circuses, and are referred to as occupational travelers, who move around as part of their work. These groups formed across Europe, and included the families of travelling funfairs and circuses that required frequent mobility. These groups usually follow a set pattern of yearly nomadism. Membership of these groups has, over the years, been drawn from other communities. For example, Showmen in Great Britain and Ireland often had a mix of English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, and/or Traveller (typically Romanichal Traveller and Irish Traveller) heritage.  \nAs a result, Funfair Travellers are not defined as an ethnic group, even though they display certain common features, although in many countries (such as the UK) they identify as a cultural group.  \nFunfair Travellers often sport unique cultures and self-identity, and they tend to be insular, favouring marriage within the community, which results in long lineages and a strong sense of cultural homogeneity. For example, the Showman's Guild of Great Britain requires that applicants have a parent from the Funfair Travelling community.  \nMany Funfair Travellers in the fairground and circus business across Europe have partial Romani heritage, evidenced by significant traces of the Romani language and matriarchal forms of social organisation. Despite this, the roots, culture, traditions, and identity of showman groups have remained separate from Romani groups.  \n## Camminanti  \nThe Camminanti are an ethnic group in Sicily, originating from the end of the 14th century.

        "question": "Analyze the given context and associated images, draw inferences from the combination of both, and provide responses to posed questions.\nContext:\n# Harold M. Shaw  \nHarold Marvin Shaw (also cited in some records as Henry Marvin Shaw; November 3, 1877January 30, 1926) was an American stage performer, film actor, screenwriter, and director during the silent era.The vast majority of records cite Shaw's full name as Harold Marvin Shaw, although a microfilm copy of his official 1926 California death certificate records his name as Henry Marvin Shaw. No original Tennessee birth certificate has yet been found that confirms his official birth name. A native of Tennessee, he worked in theatrical plays and vaudeville for 16 years before he began acting in motion pictures for Edison Studios in New York City in 1910 and then started regularly directing shorts there two years later. Shaw next served briefly as a director for Independent Moving Pictures (IMP) in New York before moving to England in May 1913 to be \"chief producer\" for the newly established London Film Company. During World War I, he relocated to South Africa, where in 1916 he directed the film De Voortrekkers in cooperation with African Film Productions, Limited. Shaw also established his own production company while in South Africa, completing there two more releases, The Rose of Rhodesia in 1918 and the comedy Thoroughbreds All in 1919. After directing films once again in England under contract with Stoll Pictures, he finally returned to the United States in 1922 and later directed several screen projects for Metro Pictures in California before his death in Los Angeles in 1926. During his 15-year film career, Shaw worked on more than 125 films either as a director, actor, or screenwriter.  \n## Early life and stage career  \nNewspaper ad for vaudeville show with Shaw, 1908  \nBorn in Brownsville, Tennessee in 1877, Harold was the child of Oliver A. Shaw of Kentucky and his first wife, Zula Waggoner,In government records Zula Waggoner's maiden name is also cited as Waggner and as Wagner in Harold Shaw's 1926 death certificate. who was also a native of Kentucky. By 1886, young Harold had relocated with his family to northern  California, to the Oakland area in Alameda County, where his father worked as a telegraph operator and by the early 1900s as an automobile \"tyre\" salesman.Harold Shaw’s father married twice, first to Zula Waggoner in 1875 and then to Laura Gertrude Plummer in California in 1887. Due to the total destruction of the United States Census of 1890 by fire, the composition of the Shaw family in Oakland that year is unknown. It appears that Harold's mother Zula died before or shortly after Oliver Shaw relocated to California, where he then wed Laura, a California native, the next year. Harold received his public education in Oakland, became interested in theatre productions there in his teenage years, and started acting professionally on stage in 1894. Over the next 16 years he traveled extensively performing with various stock companies and in vaudeville. By 1898 he had already established himself as a \"high-class\" and \"genteel\" entertainer, as one generally recognized in the print media as among \"the dramatic favorites\" of vaudeville audiences. The Kentucky Irish American, for example, the local newspaper in Louisville, informs its readers in its August 20, 1898 issue about Shaw's upcoming performances at the city's Buckingham Theater:blockquote|Lovers of vaudeville, pure, select and high-class, with no burlesque or horseplays to detract from its merits, will be amply provided for at the Buckingham the coming week, commencing with the matinee to-morrow, when Girard's Inter-Ocean Vaudevilles open for a week's engagement. It is a pleasure to note the many names of well-known and well-liked vaudeville stars combined in one show...Deservedly heading the bill will be found Miss Grace Emmet and Harold M. Shaw, the dramatic favorites who, assisted by the little comedian, Eddie Russell, will present a sketch by Arthur J. Lamb, entitled \"Why Papa Consented.\" It can be taken for granted that this will be a treat in the way of genteel comedy.  \nShaw's years of popular and critical success on the vaudeville stage led to more and more offers for leading roles in touring productions as well as supporting roles in the \"legitimate\" theatre, including Broadway productions. He performed in 1904 on Broadway in the romantic drama Olympe, which was presented at the Knickerbocker Theatre in January and February. In that play he performed in the supporting role of \"Bompain\", a hairdresser. During that time, Shaw's experience and continuing successes in all forms of stage production convinced him to form his own traveling group, Harold M. Shaw and Company, a venture that generated enough personal wealth for him that in San Francisco in August 1906 he bought a building on a two-acre site at 1303 East 14th Street and made plans to renovate the structure and convert it into a private hotel.  \n## Films  \nBy 1910, Shaw decided to expand his entertainment career into acting in motion pictures or, as they were often called in the early silent era, \"photoplays\". His first screen work was in shorts for Edison Studios, all filmed at the company's main production facility in the Bronx in New York City and on location elsewhere in the city or at nearby sites in New Jersey. While some modern film references include a pair of 1909 Edison releases in Shaw's filmographies, none of those references cite period sources or documents preserved in film archives that confirm he actually performed in those two productions. A profile of Shaw included in a 1912 issue of The Edison Kinetogram states that Shaw by then had been \"appearing in our productions by special arrangement, for the past two years\". The studio newsletter also notes that it was not until January 1912 when such special arrangements ended and the experienced performer became an official member of the Edison Stock Company, the studio's select lineup of full-time actors. Up to that point, during 1910 and 1911, Shaw continued to split his time between his projects for Edison and continuing his stage work in New York and in other locations across the country.  \n<image>Inside Edison's busy studio in the Bronx, c. 1912; Shaw is seated with paperwork numbered \"26\" tucked under his arm. Also present is fellow director Charles Brabin, seated while supervising the film being shot on the right-hand set.\nTrade publications and other records, including a surviving print of the 1910 Edison film The Attack on the Mill, confirm Shaw's work at the studio that year. The 11-minute melodrama, which is set during the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, was originally released in the United Stares on August 12, 1910. Later, when Edison distributed theatrical prints to Europe, those in the Netherlands included Dutch intertitles and were advertised and screened under a different title, De Grootmoedige molenaar (\"The Generous Miller\"). One of those Dutch prints is preserved today in the Netherlands, in the archives of the Eye Film Institute. In the film's opening sequence, Shaw, who is in heavy \"old-man's\" makeup and attired in a padded light-colored trench coat, dominates the foreground action.The title frame of the Dutch copy of The Attack on the Mill carries the date \"1907\", which is likely Edison's original copyright date on the screenplay, although it could be, but less likely, a misdating that occurred when the 1910 release was duplicated months or even years later.  \nEdison, like other studios in those early days of the silent period, produced films at seemingly breakneck speed, often completing productions in a matter of days and at times in a single day. Shaw's acting work in both uncredited and credited role was therefore equally prolific after joining Edison. He acted much more frequently in studio productions during the latter half of 1911, and in November that year was credited for his with role in Edison's adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 novel The Black Arrow. In that period he performed in a wide range of other screenplays. He portrayed, as a few examples, the title character's uncle in the light comedy Mary's Masquerade; starred in the historical drama The Death of Nathan Hale; played the title character in The Kid from the Klondike; was a major supporting player in The Reform Candidate; co-starred with Mary Fuller in The Modern Dianas; co-starred in an adaptation of British author Charles Reade's 1866 novel Foul Play; portrayed a Continental officer in How Mrs. Murray Saved the American Army; played a central character in The Awakening of John Bond, a story highlighting urban poverty and the scourge of tuberculosis; and starred in the holiday drama Santa Claus and the Clubman.\n\n### Directing at Edison, for the World's Best Film Company, and at IMP, 19121913  \nShaw in 1912 continued to act in Edison productions like The Corsican Brothers, The Bachelor's Waterloo, The Nurse, Tony's Oath of Vengeance, The Patent Housekeeper, A Man in the Making, and other assorted dramas and comedies, although the studio by mid-summer of that year elevated him to the full-time position of director. In the September 1, 1912 issue of its semimonthly newsletter The Edison Kinetogram, the company formally announces its recent promotion of Shaw:  \nPLAY The Land Beyond the Sunset (1912) directed by Shaw; runtime 00:12:45.  \nThe film-industry journal Motography also reported about Shaw's promotion, noting that at a special \"photoplay dinner\" held on September 7 for studio personnel at New York's Coney Island, he was introduced as a speaker at that event and as a \"director of Edison films\". Some of the additional films he directed during the remainder of 1912 include A Question of Seconds, A Fresh Air Romance, A Romance of the Rails, The Governor, Hearts and Diamonds, The Grandfather, Mary in Stage Land, The Girl from the Country, and The Crime of Carelessness. However, Shaw's most acclaimed directorial work from that period is The Land Beyond the Sunset, a \"'social conscience\"' film released by Edison in October 1912. The film presents the tragic contemporary tale of a New York newsboy, who lives in dire poverty with his abusive grandmother and ends with the boy drifting out to sea in a small boat, desperately searching and likely dying in a doomed attempt to find a better, more humane life beyond the horizon. In recognition of the motion picture's importance to the United States' motion-picture heritage, the Library of Congress in December 2000 selected The Land Beyond the Sunset for addition to the National Film Registry, a collection of films that are deemed \"'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'\".  \nShaw finally left Edison in January 1913after the release of At Bear Track Gulchto direct The Wizard of the Jungle, filmed on location \"in the wilds of the Florida jungleland\" for the World's Best Film Company. He then completed screen projects for Independent Moving Pictures, a New York City studio most often referred to in trade publications and in general conversations within the film industry by its acronym, \"Imp\". During the early months of 1913 he directed The Old Melody and The Cub for that studio. Regarding the latter, the film critic for the trade journal The Moving Picture World described the production as a \"a brisk, modern newspaper story, written and produced directed by Harold Shaw\", adding that the IMP release was a \"good offering\".  \n### Working in England, 19131915  \nHaving gained significant production experience managing his own theatre company and then acting in and directing screen projects for Edison and IMP, Shaw accepted an offer in May 1913 to proceed immediately to England to be \"director-in-chief\"\" for the newly established London Film Company, which was in the final stages of completing Twickenham Studios, its large production facilities in the London suburb of St. Margarets.During the early silent era, the terms \"director\" and \"producer\" were often used interchangeably at studios and in many news items and promotions in film-industry publications. The jobs had not yet evolved into distinctly different positions in motion-picture productions. His first film completed there is The House of Temperley (1913), a drama produced in collaboration with Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of Rodney Stone, the 1896 novel on which the motion picture is based. In fact, that adaptation directed by Shaw was the first feature released by the London Film Company as well as the first picture completed at Twickenham. The House of Temperley proved to be a commercial success in both Britain and overseas markets, prompting the London studio to assign Shaw to direct more than 30 additional projects for the company between 1913 and 1915.  \nAfter the outbreak of World War I in late July 1914, Shaw was described as an enthusiastic, \"firm supporter\" of the Allied cause during the conflict. He immediately volunteered for the Canadian army to support the British empire but was turned down for service. Despite that rejection, Shaw at London Films began writing and directing additional screen projects, many with stirring \"military-patriotic\" themes as well as short dramas with scenarios about \"German spies and intrigues\". One of his widely distributed and most effective wartime releases is You!, a military-recruitment drama released in January 1916. Commissioned by the Parliamentary Recruitment Committee, it is considered to be one of the most significant World War I propaganda films by British film historians. Those war-related, propaganda projects appear to have created personal links and associations with officials in the United Kingdom's Foreign Office. Over the next two years, Shaw also continued to direct comedies and romance dramas aimed at general audiences. Many of those films included his future wife, American actress Edna Flugrath, who by 1915 had become a popular lead with British theatergoers for her performances in an array of Shaw-directed productions, a few examples being The Ring and the Rajah (1914), England's Menace (1914), Liberty Hall (1914), The Heart of a Child (1915), and The Derby Winner (1915).  \n### South Africa, 19161919  \n<image>De Voortrekkers (1916) includes battle scenes with several thousand extras costumed as Zulu warriors and as heavily armed Dutch settlers.The cited number of extras who re-enacted the Battle of Blood River vary significantly in period trade publications and in later sources, with numbers ranging as high as 10,000 costumed performers. The true total of extras was likely far less than that figure. In an interview published in the December 18, 1920 issue of the London-based film journal Picture Show, Edna Flugrath Shaw describes some of her many \"adventures\" while working on location as an actor. She states that during the filming of De Voortrekkers \"Five thousand natives of Africa were taking part and five hundred Dutch.\" She also states that 137 black extras were injured during the filming of battle sequences. The specific number she cites for injuries and the fact she was present at the filming indicate that she had detailed knowledge of her husband's overall casting for the production, a knowledge that enhances her credibility for the numbers she cites.\nIn May 1916with the approval if not the encouragement of Foreign Office officials in LondonShaw moved to South Africa after accepting a job offer from African Film Productions (AFP) to be that company's \"chief producer-director\". Central to that assignment was for Shaw to direct De Voortrekkers, a planned historical epic to be filmed in KwaZulu-Natal. The project proposed to portray from the perspective of that region's white minority the \"Great Trek\" made by Dutch-speaking Voortrekkers or \"pioneers\" in the 1830s, a time when South Africa was a colony of Great Britain. AFP and other backers of the film envisioned a production of \"Griffith-like scale\" that hoped \"to capture white Afrikaner (Boer) patriotic pride and to earn possible super-profits from export overseas.\" The film ultimately completed by Shaw later in 1916 features in its extensive cast Dick Cruikshanks, Percy Marmont, and Edna Flugrath and includes an elaborate recreation of the Battle of Blood River of 1838, when a few hundred armed Dutch-speaking Boers defeated thousands of Zulu warriors.  \nAccording to actress Flugrath, who married Harold Shaw a month after the film's release, location work on De Voortrekkers took its toll on cast and crew, especially on the director and on scores of native African extras injured during the battle re-enactment. Simulated fights between black and white performers during filming quickly escalated to genuine, near deadly off-camera altercations after some of the extras portraying the Dutch settlers \"secretly filled their guns with pebbles\" instead of firing empty barrels at their Zulu counterparts. The situation quickly \"got out of hand\", recalled Flugrath, with one Zulu extra getting so enraged after being wounded by pebbles that he \"threw his assegai spear at Mr. Shaw\", which only missed him \"by a few inches.\" \"It was a miracle\", she added, \"that he was not killed.\"  \nDe Voortrekkers premiered in South Africa on December 16, 1916 for \"Dingaan's Day\" celebrations at Krugersdorp, marking at the time the 78th anniversary of the battle. The screen drama then circulated to major cities, where it proved to be extremely popular with white audiences. By March 1917, even American trade papers were reporting that Shaw's \"Boer film\" in Pretoria was \"drawing big houses\". The original print distributed to South African cinemas reportedly had a runtime of \"some two hours\", although much shorted versions of the picture were later presented in foreign markets.A shorter version of the original South African film De Voortrekkers, one retitled Winning a Continent, was later presented in England but not generally distributed to theaters in the United States until December 1924.  \nStudio buildings of Harold Shaw Films Productions near Cape Town, South Africa, 1918  \nAfter the release of De Voortrekkers and the end of his association with AFP, Shaw in late January 1917 embarked on an extended international journey, leaving South Africa and traveling for months to India, Ceylon, the Far East, Egypt, and to other destinations. The tour, conducted for both business-related reasons and as a honeymoon trip after marrying Edna Flugrath, consumed most of the year, but Shaw returned to South Africa near the end of 1917. At that time he decided to establish his own motion picture company there, selecting Sea Point, a suburb of Cape Town, as the site to build his production facilities. The company's first studio building, which was constructed around a renovated \"abandoned carbarn\", was surrounded by attractive seascapes and landscapes that provided Shaw a wide assortment of convenient filming locations, ranging from Table Bay with its broad stretches of beach to diverse higher elevations distinguished by Lion's Head Mountain. In March 1918, the widely read American trade paper Variety reported a few details about the new studio's principal employees: Under the administration of his new company, Shaw completed two more releases before leaving South Africa and returning to England: The Rose of Rhodesia in 1918, the first production filmed at Sea Point, and the comedy Thoroughbreds All in 1919.\n\n### Later films in England, 19201922  \nShaw returned to London in the final weeks of 1919 after closing his studio facilities in Cape Town. Once re-established in the English capital, he initially worked on a few pictures for the financially struggling London Film Company, which finally ceased operations late in 1920. Soon, though, the experienced filmmaker accepted a commission offered by Basil Thomson, the chief of intelligence for Britain's Home Office, to direct a proposed production, one with a storyline set within the ongoing civil war in Russia between Bolshevik forces and anti-communists. The film, titled The Land of Mystery, was to be shot on location in and around \"Kovno\", Lithuania, and intended in part to present a thinly veiled, unflattering portrayal of the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. With Shaw's wife Edna Flugrath and English actor Norman Tharp in co-starring roles, the project proved to be a grueling experience for cast and crew while traveling and filming for weeks in the late-winter conditions of far-off Lithuania. Tharp, who closely resembled Lenin, portrayed in the production the dissolute character \"Lenoff\", who falls desperately in love with a ballerina (Flugrath), becomes a ruthless Bolshevik revolutionary, and ultimately commits suicide when she elopes with a Russian prince.  \nOn both sides of the Atlantic, film-industry publications periodically reported on Shaw's progress on the \"anti-Bolshevik film\". Variety in the United States, in its March 26, 1920 issue, updates its readers:Harold Shaw is on his way to Poland with a company of British artists to make a picture with a Bolshevist setting. The interior work was completed in the \"London\" studios last week. A mysterious gentleman, Boris Said, is apparently behind the venture.  \nThe Land of Mystery was released in the United Kingdom in July 1920 and was presented \"week after week\" in London and elsewhere in England. Despite the film's commercial success, the logistical challenges of shooting the drama in Lithuania and the ensuing political controversies connected to the British government's association with its production may have influenced Shaw's decision to accept an offer in the fall of 1920 from Stoll Pictures in London to join its staff of directors. Stoll at the time was the largest motion-picture studio in England, employing over a 1000 people at its operations in Cricklewood, where the company had a sprawling complex of buildings formerly used by an aircraft factory that had closed after World War I.  \nStoll's directors (Shaw standing, left) with the studio's managing director Jeffrey Bernerd (sitting, center), late 1920  \nShaw for two years directed a series of dramas and comedies at Stoll. His first for the studio is Kipps (1921), an adaptation of H. G. Wells' 1905 novel. During that film's production, Motion Picture News reported that Shaw went on location for one day to the prestigious Savoy Hotel in central London and \"took over the lounge and grill room\" of the building to shoot scenes. It was further reported that H. G. Wells himself was present at that filming, which occurred during the hotel's less-congested hours between \"midnight until seven in the morning\". Kipps was another critical and commercial success for Shaw, who completed at Cricklewood and on location in various English counties at least six more films for Stoll: The Woman of His Dream (1921); A Dear Fool (1921); General John Regan (1921); False Evidence  (1922); The Wheels of Chance (1922), another adaptation of a work by Wells; and Love and a Whirlwind (1922).  \n### Return to the United States and final films, 19221925  \nShaw at piano rehearsing with Viola Dana for Rouged Lips (1923)  \nShaw and Edna returned to the United States in 1922, arriving at Ellis Island in September, over two months before the release in London of Harold's final film for Stoll, Love and a Whirlwind.efn|Trade publications in the fall of 1922 reported that among the chief reasons that Shaw returned to the United States after a decade working overseas was that Edna's mother, Mary (née Gauch) Flugrath, was sick and was rapidly declining in health. According to the \"California Death Index, 1905-1939\" in California's Department of Health Services, Mrs. Flugrath died on 30 November 1922 in a private sanatorium in Los Angeles. Soon the couple left New York and resettled in California, in Los Angeles, where by the summer of 1923 Shaw began directing screen projects for Metro Pictures. His first one for that studio is Rouged Lips and stars his sister-in-law Viola Dana. The silent romantic comedy was well received by both critics and audiences, with the Chicago-based reviewing service Screen Opinions judging the production to be \"neatly directed\" and its content \"clean, full of ginger\".  \nTwo other releases that the director completed for Metro are the 1923 drama Held to Answer, currently considered lost, and the 1924 drama A Fool's Awakening. The casting of A Fool's Awakening prompted the entertainment media and the Los Angeles film community to observe how Shaw's years of experience residing and working in England influenced his selection of performers. In its January 5, 1924 issue, the trade journal Moving Picture World in a news item headed \"English Types in Films\" stated, \"Aristocratic appearing Britons have been at a premium in Hollywood ever since Harold Shaw began the direction of 'The  Fool's Awakening'\", adding \"More than three hundred and fifty persons, each bearing the unmistakable stamp of British aristocracy, appeared in one of the great scenes.\"  \nIn addition to directing and planning future film projects in Hollywood, Shaw became increasingly active in local and national professional organizations, especially in the Motion Picture Directors Association (MPDA). He was elected secretary of the association in October 1925, just a few months before his untimely death.The Motion Picture Directors Association was established in Los Angeles in 1915, and the next year association members in California helped fellow directors working in New York City to form their own eastern branch of MPDA, which was incorporated there in January 1917. When Shaw died he was serving as secretary of the Hollywood or western branch of the association, the senior and more prestigious division of MPDA.  \n## Personal life  \nShaw married twice. On October 29, 1900, he wed 22-year-old Myrtle Chapman in Wilmington, Delaware at the parsonage of Minister C. A. Grise. Their marriage ended by divorce before April 4, 1910, when Myrtle married again in New York City. Seven years later, Shaw also remarried, then to actress Edna Flugrath. During his time working at Edison Studios, he met Flugrath, who was a native of Brooklyn, New York and a contract player with the studio. The couple, not yet married, were separated in 1913 when Shaw left the United States to direct films in London, but Flugrath followed him overseas the next year after her own contract with Edison expired. She worked as a lead as well as a support player in many productions that Shaw directed in England and later in South Africa, where they married. On January 5, 1917three weeks after the release of De Voortrekkersthe couple wed in Johannesburg. They then departed on an extended trip to India, Ceylon, China, Japan, Siam, Egypt, and England for the dual purposes of honeymooning and, as cited in their passport applications, for conducting \"Moving picture business\" at all those destinations. The two remained together until Harold's death nine years later. Edna survived him by 40 years, dying in San Diego, California in April 1966. The couple had no children.  \n## Death  \nOn January 30, 1926, Shaw died in an automobile accident in Los Angeles, where the car in which he was a passenger collided with another vehicle at the intersection of Sixth Street and Rossmore Avenue. Contemporary reports of the crash state that one of Shaw's friends, who was driving the vehicle, was thrown clear by the impact and survived with only minor cuts and bruises. Shaw, however, was \"buried underneath the car\" when it overturned, and according to the findings of an inquest, he had died instantly in the wreck due to massive head trauma. Unfortunately, despite Harold M. Shaw's lengthy stage and film career, which spanned a full 30 years, he was still misidentified as \"G. Harold Shaw\" in the obituary that Variety published four days after his death. His years of association with film productions in London also led the New York trade paper in that same obituary to refer to the Tennessee-born director as \"a native of England\", and Variety also incorrectly cited his age as 38 instead of 48.  \nA memorial service for Shaw was conducted in Hollywood \"at the undertaker parlors of Strother & Dayton\" on February 3, 1926 by members of the \"233 Club\", the local Masonic Temple. Since returning to California in 1923, the director had become active in not only professional organizations such as MPDA but also in the 233 Club, which was founded in Los Angeles in 1924 and required that every one of its members be \"'a motion picture worker in any capacity'\". Following the club's memorial service, Shaw's body was cremated and his final remains were enshrined at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.  \nMonths after Shaw's death, in the June 1926 issue of Photoplay magazine, staff writer Dorothy Spensley reflects on the tragic irony of the director's accidental, rather mundane death after all of the dangerous adventures he and his wife had experienced during their film careers:blockquote|Nothing could happen to Edna and Harold. They had braved the perils of German air-raids in London, had hob-nobbed with the Bolsheviks in Russia, had stolen bread from the Germans in revolt in Berlin to sustain life, had worked and sweltered beneath the South African sun to bring, triumphant, from the veldt a film of the winning of the continent...There had been many, many hazardous undertakings by Harold Shaw and Edna Flugarth Shaw....Then one morning about four months ago, a newsboy shouting: \"'Extra! Film Director Dies in Auto Accident!'\" In that raucous voice that only a newsboy has...Harold Shaw of those perilous expeditions felled...Edna a widow.\"  \n## Selected filmography  \n<image>The theater poster for Edison's 1911 Christmas drama in which Shaw starred as \"The Clubman\"\nThe Wizard of the Jungle (1913) directed by Shaw for World's Best Film Company  \nMetro promotion of Shaw's film Rouged Lips (1923)  \n* The Attack on the Mill (1910)  \n* The Child and the Tramp (1911)  \n* Bob and Rowdy (1911)  \n* The Modern Dianas (1911)  \n* The Three Musketeers (1911)  \n* The Big Dam (1911)  \n* Mary's Masquerade (1911)  \n* The Death of Nathan Hale (1911)  \n* Foul Play (1911)  \n* Her Wedding Ring (1911)  \n* A Conspiracy Against the King (1911)  \n* The Kid From the Klondike (1911)  \n* The Reform Candidate (1911)  \n* The Black Arrow (1911)  \n* Home, A Thanksgiving Story  \n* The Lure of the City (1911)  \n* The Awakening of John Bond (1911)  \n* Santa Claus and the Clubman (1911)  \n* Freezing Auntie (1912)  \n* The Jewels (1912)  \n* Mother and Daughters (1912)  \n* Thirty Days at Hard Labor (1912)  \n* A Question of Seconds (1912)  \n* The Corsican Brothers (1912)  \n* The Bachelor's Waterloo (1912)  \n* Martin Chuzzlewit (1912)  \n* The Convict's Parole (1912)  \n* The Man Who Made Good (1912)  \n* The Bank President's Son (1912)  \n* Hearts and Diamonds (1912)  \n* The Grandfather (1912)  \n* Mary in Stage Land (1912)  \n* The Girl from the Country (1912)  \n* A Fresh Air Romance (1912)  \n* The Land Beyond the Sunset (1912)  \n* The Old Reporter (1912)  \n* The Third Thanksgiving (1912)  \n* On Donovan's Division (1912)  \n* A Christmas Accident (1912)  \n* The Crime of Carelessness (1912)  \n* The Wizard of the Jungle (1913)  \n* The Old Melody (1913)  \n* The House of Temperley (1913)  \n* Lawyer Quince (1914)  \n* Liberty Hall (1914)  \n* The Ring and the Rajah (1914)  \n* Clancarty (1914)  \n* Child o' My Heart (1914)  \n* England's Menace (1914)  \n* Trilby (1914)  \n* Two Little Ambitions (1914)  \n* For Home and Country (1914)  \n* The King's Minister (1914)  \n* Two Little Britons (1914)  \n* The Victoria Cross (1914)  \n* A Christmas Carol (1914)  \n* Brother Officers (1915)  \n* The Ashes of Revenge (1915)  \n* The Heart of a Child (1915)  \n* The Derby Winner (1915)  \n* The Third Generation (1915)  \n* Mr. Lyndon at Liberty (1915)  \n* The Heart of Sister Ann (1915  \n* The Firm of Girdlestone (1915)  \n* Me and Me Moke (1916)  \n* Me and M'Pal (1916)  \n* You!

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# List of Billboard number-one country songs of 1952  \nIn 1952, Billboard magazine published three charts covering the best-performing country music songs in the United States.  At the start of the year, the charts were published under the titles Most-Played Juke Box (Country & Western) Records, Best-Selling Retail Folk (Country & Western) Records and Country & Western Records Most Played By Folk Disk Jockeys.  Beginning with the issue of Billboard dated November 15, the titles of the charts were changed to Most Played in Juke Boxes, National Best Sellers, and Most Played By Jockeys respectively, with the genre denoted in an overall page title rather than within the titles of the charts themselves.  All three charts are considered part of the lineage of the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart, which was first published in 1958.  \nIn the first issue of Billboard of the year, \"Slow Poke\" by Pee Wee King retained its place at number one on both the juke box and retail charts from the previous week but was displaced from the top spot on the jockeys chart by Carl Smith's \"Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way\".  Smith had three number-one country songs in 1952, two of which topped all three listings.  Webb Pierce was the only other artist to take as many as three different songs to the top spot in 1952, although none of his songs reached number one on all three charts during the year.  The longest-running number one on both the juke box and retail charts was \"The Wild Side of Life\" by Hank Thompson, which on both listings  spent fifteen consecutive weeks in the top spot before being replaced by \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" by Kitty Wells.  Wells' song, which had been written as an answer song to \"The Wild Side of Life\", was the first million-selling country single by a female artist and the first Billboard country number one by a solo female.  Despite this success, it did not top the jockeys chart, as the song's lyrics were deemed too controversial by some radio stations.  \nThe longest-running number one on the jockeys chart was \"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\" by Hank Williams, which spent thirteen non-consecutive weeks atop the chart.   The Cajun-inspired song was the final number one of the year on both that chart and the retail listing and was thus in the top spot when Williams died early on January 1, 1953.  The year's final number one on the juke box chart was \"Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes\" by Skeets McDonald, which reached the peak position in the issue of Billboard dated December 27.  McDonald's version of the song reached the top spot three weeks after its writer, Slim Willet, had taken his own recording of the track to number one on the jockeys chart.  The song would prove to be the only country number one for both McDonald and Willet and both had only short chart careers; in Willet's case it was his only charting song.  In contrast, the three other singers who reached number one for the first time in 1952 would go on to achieve further chart-toppers and be elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame in recognition of their long and successful careers.  Hank Thompson and Kitty Wells each gained the first of three number ones in 1952 and remained top 10 regulars until the late 1960s.  Webb Pierce topped the jockeys chart in March with \"Wondering\", his first charting song.  It was the first of 12 number ones which the singer gained in less than four years, and he achieved more than 80 top 40 entries during his career.  \n## Chart history  \n<image>alt=A dark-haired man wearing a neckerchief, a shirt with fringes dangling from the sleeves, and pants with a guitar pictured on them, smiling broadly while leaning on a guitar\n\n<image>alt=A man wearing a cowboy hat and a light-colored jacket, holding a guitar\n\n<image>alt=A fair-haired man in a dark jacket and light-coloured sweater playing a guitar and singing\n\n\n\nQuestion: Which image shows a man wearing a neckerchief and a shirt with fringes dangling from the sleeves?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Dreams and Nightmares  \nDreams and Nightmares is the debut studio album by American rapper Meek Mill, released on October 30, 2012, by Maybach Music Group and Warner Bros. Records. Mill intended for it to be authentic and more cohesive than his mixtapes, having a stronger connection through both vocals and beats. The album features guest appearances from Kirko Bangz, Rick Ross, Nas, John Legend, Drake, Wale, and Mary J. Blige, among others. Production was primarily handled by Jahlil Beats and Boi-1da, alongside the likes of Tone the Beat Bully and Key Wane. The recording took place from January to September 2012, including sessions in a studio bus on the Club Paradise Tour. Sessions were also held in Los Angeles and Miami, and multiple recordings were included on Mill's ninth mixtape, Dreamchasers 2 (2012). The dreams represent Mill making money as a performer, while the nightmares are based on coming up from his neighbourhood.  \n\"Amen\" was released as the lead single in June 2012, followed by \"Burn\" and \"Young & Gettin' It\" later that year, before \"Believe It\" in early 2013. Music videos were produced for all of the releases, while the lead single and \"Young & Gettin' It\" both charted on the US Billboard Hot 100.  Mill embarked on the Dreamchasers Tour for further promotion in August 2012, performing at 16 cities in the United States. Dreams and Nightmares received generally positive reviews from music critics, who mostly commended Mill's development into mainstream rap. Some praised his rapping, while a few critics highlighted the dreams theme. The album was named to 2012 year-end lists by multiple publications, including Rap Radar and The Source.  \nDreams and Nightmares debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 165,000 copies in the first week in the US. It has since been certified gold in the country by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album reached numbers six and five on the Canadian Albums and UK R&B Albums charts, respectively. In November 2022, Mill held a 10th anniversary concert at the Wells Fargo Center, beginning with footage throughout his career and featuring appearances from the likes of Fabulous, Fivio Foreign, and Rick Ross.  \n## Background and recording  \n<image>Prior to the album's release, Mill announced an appearance from fellow rapper Nas, who gave praise to his work.\nIn late January 2012, Mill announced his debut album to Hot 97 host Angie Martinez, with a release planned for the summer of 2012. The following month, Mill revealed the album's title to be Dreams and Nightmares in a vlog. Mill released his ninth mixtape Dreamchasers 2 on May 7, 2012, in the lead-up to Dreams and Nightmares. That same month, Mill declared backstage to MTV News to expect from the album \"quality music and you're gonna get the real me\", explaining it would not \"be all over the place\" like his mixtapes. He elaborated that he was going to establish a connection, trying to \"perfect my craft a little more\", assuring his flows blend better with the beats and these have more clarity. Mill was hopeful to include guest appearances from fellow rappers French Montana and Rick Ross, yet still insisted some features would be a surprise. In a May 2012 interview for The Juice, he added that the rappers featured would depend on how the unfinished tracks felt: \"If I have a song that sounds like it fits Nicki Minaj the best or it fits T.I. the best, that's the people I would sort of lean towards getting on them songs. But it depends on how the songs fit the person.\"  \nDreams and Nightmares features production on numerous tracks from record producer Jahlil Beats, who was first introduced to Mill via Myspace. He had previously contributed to Mill's Flamers 2: Hottest In Tha City (2009) and Dreamchasers 2, becoming a frequent collaborator of the rapper. Jahlil Beats said of collaborating that their chemistry \"was destined to happen\", emphasizing how well his drums and Mill's flow blend together. Jamaician-Canadian record producer Boi-1da produced the tracks \"Traumatized\" and \"Tony Story Pt. 2\", while production was also contributed by the likes of Tone the Beat Bully, Young Shun, Infamous, The-Agency, and Key Wane. In early August 2012, Hip-Hop Wired reported that the album's release date was postponed from August 28 to late October 2012. That same month, Mill implored to Wild 94.9 that he desired to stay true to hip hop and have a \"classic album\" comparable to the likes of Nas' Illmatic (1994), Jay-Z's Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life (1998), and 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin (2003). Nas voiced his approval of Mill, \"I got my eyes on him. He's the next one to take this shit over.\"  \nIn early October 2012, Mill shared the track list for Dreams and Nightmares, which showed the two bonus tracks. Around the same time, Mill revealed that major musical acts like Nas, Rick Ross, John Legend, and Mary J. Blige were set to be featured. He also announced an appearance from fellow rapper and Maybach signee Wale, who described Mill as being in a \"special moment\" when wanting to make history. At the end of October 2012, Mill was detained by the Philadelphia Police Department on his way to the album's listening party. The department could not disclose the reasoning, though he was angry at having to share handcuffs with the Rolex watch on his wrist for the cover art. Mill explained the conception of Dreams and Nightmares, detailing that the dreams represent \"being on tour and television, gettin' paid for doing what I love to do\", while \"the nightmares was just makin' it to this point, the hard work and bein' in the streets\". He elaborated that there was darker incidents during his younger years in Philadelphia, alluding to acts he considered bad and unspecified violence.  \nIn January 2012, the recording process for the album began. This continued as Mill embarked on the Dreamchasers Tour and promoted Dreamchasers 2, releasing some of the recordings on the mixtape. As him and fellow rapper Nipsey Hussle listened to beats from American-Jamaican musician Sean Kingston in the studio, Mill came up with song lyrics. American record producer Spiff brought in a batch of 80 beats, while Jahlil Beats noted Mill's high level of energy that culminates in \"some crossover records\" and \"a few fast records\". In May 2012, Mill stated that he was recording between two and three songs a day in a studio he had recently installed on his bus for Canadian musician Drake's Club Paradise Tour. The rapper said that although none of the tracks had been made final for Dreams and Nightmares, his collaboration \"Maybach Curtains\" with Nas had a possibility of appearing. Footage of the rappers in a Los Angeles studio that same month showed him playing two tracks from the album that Nas appreciated, including \"Maybach Curtains\". In July 2012, the track was leaked to the internet. A month prior, Mill was joined in his recording bus by major rap acts like Wale, French Montana, and J. Cole. Rick Ross gave studio advice to Mill of making the tracks feel perfect and part of a cohesive record; he responded by freestyling and telling fellow rapper the Game it was \"that feeling\". In early September 2012,  Mill relocated to a Miami studio for the final recording sessions, including the title track \"Dreams and Nightmares\".\n\n## Music and lyrics  \nDreams and Nightmares is a hip hop album, incorporating elements of orchestral and pop music. The album frequently utilizes piano, which The A.V. Clubs Evan Rytlewski called \"a softer template\" than Mill's mixtapes. Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork described Dreams and Nightmares as \"distinct in both voice and sound\", observing it is \"tense and dramatic\" through the variations of piano and Mill's rapping. Some reviews considered the music to be formulaic; PopMatters Matthew Fiander said Mill aims for commercial success over creativity and is accompanied by \"the machinations of Maybach like overdone beats\". David Jeffries from AllMusic depicted the album as disorganized with less care than a mixtape, yet thought that \"sliced off into little bits, this is the glittery gangster feeling\" to be expected for Maybach. Multiple publications noted Mill's loud delivery, with Fiander and the staff of XXL believing that he yells throughout.  \nMill summarized Dreams and Nightmares: \"The dream part is me living as an artist making money touring across the world, and nightmares touches on everything that it took for me to make it from the streets.\" The album features Mill reflecting on his earlier struggles in life, showing how he became credible and juxtaposing these with his current situation. He tells his story of reaching triumph from the struggles, including crime, drug dealing, and growing up in a rough urban area. Mill expresses a desire for money and disregard for the associated fame, albeit acknowledging his wealth is tainted by how it was earnt. He also boasts of his lifestyle, while maintaining his dedication and grit. The rapper ventures between dreams and nightmares, which are represented by his successes and inner demons, respectively.  \n## Songs  \n<image>Rick Ross is featured on numerous tracks, including the single \"Believe It\".\nDreams and Nightmares begins with the title track, which relies on piano stabs and strings. The track has a beat switch in the middle to transition from the dreams to the nightmares portion; Mill changes from celebrating victory to rapping angrily about issues in his past. \"In God We Trust\" features a maximalist beat, over which Mill raps forcefully about killing a man. \"Young & Gettin' It\" contains elements of club and usage of Auto-Tune, with lyrics about the strength to sell drugs from Mill and a hook from fellow rapper Kirko Bangz. Soul elements, hallow chimes, and filtered moans back Mill hypothesizing a conversation warning his father's murderer he will kill him on \"Traumatized\", expressing loss and regret. \"Believe It\" begins with Rick Ross referencing Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber, before Mill touches on struggle and triumph. Rick Ross appears on the next track \"Maybach Curtains\", alongside Nas' guest verse and crooning from Legend. The track features pop and R&B elements, and Mill recalls drug dealing. \"Amen\" maintains these elements and has a gospel beat, alongside Mill and Drake discussing sexual exploitation and excessive wealth.  \nOn \"Young Kings\", Mill recalls the pressure of drug dealing, as well as lamenting his father's death and expressing \"fuck fame\" to focus on his money. \"Lay Up\" is a pop slow jam that sees him reference admiration of his status, featuring Wale showing off to women and an appearance from Rick Ross. \"Tony Story Pt. 2\" serves as a sequel to the track from Mill's 2011 mixtape Dreamchasers and utilizes windshield wipers as percussion, with the rapper telling the story of gunplay leading into the tragedy of death. \"Who You're Around\" features Mill meditating on damaged personal friendships, joined by Blige on the chorus. On \"Polo & Shell Tops\", Mill raps about resorting to selling crack cocaine to earn money and get revenge on others. \"Rich & Famous\" is a pop track, which includes Mill speaking of material wealth and spending time with a woman. On \"Real Niggas Come First\", Mill reminisces on drug dealing. \"Burn\" is an up-tempo number, which sees Mill and fellow rapper Big Sean perform back and forth. \"Freak Show\" is a club number set in a similar tempo, featuring rapper 2 Chainz and DJ Sam Sneaker, with a refrain referencing fellatio.\n\n## Release and promotion  \nAt the start of October 2012, Mill shared the cover art for the album. The artwork uses Mill's gold Rolex watch for symbolizing dreams, alongside handcuffs for nightmares. Complex named the album cover the 18th best of 2012. At the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, Mill performed \"Amen\" and \"Young & Gettin' It\". During the months leading up to October, Mill played the album for Jay-Z and appreciated the feedback from someone of his status, getting along well with him personally. In mid-October 2012, Mill and Rick Ross previewed it at Electric Lady Studios in NYC for rappers such as Jay-Z, Will Smith, and Wale, as well as singers Estelle and The-Dream. Mill declared that he was staying true to his early days with \"In God We Trust\", delivering \"that hard street shit\" unlike much of mainstream rap. At the premiere, Rick Ross said about Mill: \"I'm proud of my homie. Everything he has accomplished, he earned himself.\"  \nOn October 19, 2012, Mill premiered \"Maybach Curtains\". The next week, he appeared on MTV's weekly show RapFix Live to promote Dreams and Nightmares, performing his scrapped second verse from the song. Hours before his appearance, the album leaked online and Mill responded by telling host Sway Calloway, \"I ain't tripping. If people wanna buy your album, they're gonna buy your album whether it's gonna leak or not.\" Dreams and Nightmares was released on October 30, 2012, through Mill's labels Maybach and Warner Bros. The deluxe version was released simultaneously, featuring \"Burn\" and \"Freak Show\". A day after the album's release, Mill held a release party in Atlanta, arriving on time after being detained. On January 27, 2013, a music video for the title track was released, documenting Mill's career up to Dreams and Nightmares.  \n### Singles  \n\"Amen\" was released for digital download and streaming as the lead single from Dreams and Nightmares on June 19, 2012, by Maybach and Warner Bros. A month earlier, the song had been included on Dreamchasers 2. The song's music video was released on June 15, 2012, interspersing footage of Mill and Drake partying late at night with clips of the Club Paradise Tour. \"Amen\" reached number 57 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and it was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for pushing 500,000 certified units in the United States in July 2015. \"Burn\" was released to download and streaming formats in the US as the second single on September 11, 2012, through Mill's labels. Like \"Amen\", the song was first released on the mixtape. An accompanying music video premiered on October 10, 2012, which features Mill and Big Sean accompanied by models and exploding cars inside a warehouse. The song topped the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. \"Burn\" was awarded a gold certification from the RIAA for amassing 500,000 certified units in the US in May 2019.  \nOn September 19, 2012, \"Young & Gettin' It\" was released as the third single from Dreams and Nightmares and the first one not from the mixtape. The song's music video was debuted on September 28, showing Mill and Kirko Bangz partying on a yacht, before changing to Miami. \"Young & Gettin' It\" reached number 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it was certified gold by the RIAA for shelving 500,000 certified units in July 2017.  On February 19, 2013, \"Believe It\" was sent to US urban contemporary radio stations as the album's fourth and final single by Maybach and Warner Bros. An accompanying music video premiered on March 24, beginning with Mill and Rick Ross making a business transaction in the desert and then partying in Las Vegas. The song peaked at number 22 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.  \n### Concerts  \nIn late June 2012, Mill announced his Dreamchasers Tour to promote Dreams and Nightmares, performing at 16 cities across the US. Mill subsequently shared its poster alongside footage of him engaging in activities like performing and driving fast vehicles, accompanied by a list of accolades and the opening caption \"Dream chasing is an occupation\". Tickets were made available on June 30, 2012, via Ticketmaster and Live Nation. Mill posted \"All Access\" footage in August, showing him and his team riding around on vehicles such as dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles. The tour kicked off at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, Colorado on August 2, 2012, while it finished 25 days later at Irving Plaza in New York City (NYC). DJ sets by DJ Drama and Casey Veggies were included on the Dreamchasers Tour, as well as cameos from rappers like Yo Gotti, Bow Wow, Ace Hood, Waka Flocka Flame, and T.I.  \n<image>Mill performed the concert \"Meek Mill + Friends: Dreams and Nightmares Ten Year Anniversary\" at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center in November 2022\nAt the end of October 2022, Mill announced a 10th anniversary concert on Instagram, billed as \"Meek Mill + Friends: Dreams and Nightmares Ten Year Anniversary\". Mill also revealed a promotional poster and that it was set to take place at the Wells Fargo Center in his hometown of Philadelphia on November 26, coinciding with Thanksgiving in the US. Tickets for the event went on sale via the venue's website at 10 a.m. in early November 2022, although the rapper did not disclose any of the guests initially. The musical direction was handled by Gil Smith II.  \nPrior to Mill appearing at the Wells Fargo Center, footage played from the early days of his career with the \"nappy braids that locked\", then his Flamers mixtapes, the release of Dreams and Nightmares, and finally the icon he had widely become. \"Friends\" in the concert's title was represented by the rappers that joined Mill, including Fabulous, Fivio Foreign, Jim Jones, and A Boogie wit da Hoodie. Mill performed a few tracks from his recently released mixtape Flamers 5, as well as popular album tracks such as \"1942 Flows\" (2017) and \"Respect the Game\" (2018). He ended rumours of tensions with Rick Ross by bringing him out to perform \"I'm a Boss\" (2011), while Mill accompanied the rapper as he performed his own tracks. Mill finished the event by performing \"Dreams and Nightmares\", telling the crowd he appreciated their support from his time at the bottom and he raps for Philadelphia.\n\n## Critical reception  \nDreams and Nightmares was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 17 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.0 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.  \nAllMusic's  Jeffries asserted that the album succeeds in the themes of both dreams and nightmares, finalizing it \"is still satisfying and a step forward\" for an album release after mixtapes, \"slicked up and pimped out in a way that's entirely Maybach\". Similarly, Sargent from Pitchfork celebrated the record's transition to the mainstream after Mill's mixtapes for being \"distinct in both voice and sound\" as it shows his strengths, highlighting his emotion and themes. The staff of XXL declared that \"Dreams and Nightmares doesn't break new grounds in hip-hop\", serving as a release for Mill to gain respect \"on the verge of universal acceptance\" like Rick Ross and Wale similarly did.  \nMarcus J. Moore of BBC Music thought Mill's character of \"a decent wordsmith with a gruff disposition\" seemed obvious and the album \"won't break new ground\" in hip hop, feeling somewhat underwhelmed by the compositions and lyrics, yet observing \"a respectable effort that... moves him beyond illicit history\". Edwin Ortiz from HipHopDX said the album proves that \"Mill needs more time before he can rightfully call himself the lieutenant of the MMG army\", concluding it is \"a dream that could be forgotten by mid-day\". Rytlewski was less enthusiastic in The A.V. Club, seeing the album as another addition to the \"already distinguished discography\" of Mill's mixtapes and appearances on Maybach compilations. He grudgingly acknowledged the responsibility of following standards for debuts through the likes of \"sweeping themes\" and reflective lyricism, concluding Mill's execution is competent and the conventional focus only takes him backwards.  \n### Accolades  \nDreams and Nightmares appeared on year-end lists for 2012 of multiple publications. Rap Radar listed the album as the seventh best of the year; Paul \"Big Homie\" Duong believed that Mill continued the success of his Dreamchasers mixtapes and tells \"the prison walls to the hall of fame storyline\" to a top level, concluding \"this is what dreams are truly made of\". The Source named Dreams and Nightmares as the 18th best album of 2012, while journalist Chris Morris picked it as the 10th best hip hop album for North Country Public Radio. The record was named the 15th best hip hop album of the year by Spin. For the 2014 issue of XXL that celebrated 40 years of hip hop, it was listed as one of the five best albums of 2012.  \n## Commercial performance  \nDreams and Nightmares debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 165,000 units and becoming the highest debut of the week. It was held off the top spot by singer Taylor Swift's Red, while the opening sales were only 1,000 apart from Wale's 2011 album Ambition that reached the same position. HipHopDX had predicted that Dreams and Nightmares would reach the top three of the chart, estimating 175,000 to 200,000 first-week sales. It entered the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart at number one.  \nIn its second tracking week, the album sold 41,000 copies, reaching 206,000 units in the US. By July 2015, it had amassed 414,000 units. In May 2016, Dreams and Nightmares was awarded a gold certification from the RIAA for reaching 500,000 certified units in the US. Despite not being released as a single, the title track was certified double platinum by the RIAA for amassing 2,000,000 certified units in the country three years later. The album experience lesser success in Canada, peaking at number six on the Canadian Albums Chart. In the United Kingdom, it reached number five on the UK R&B Albums Chart.  \n## Track listing  \nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.  \nNotes  \n* signifies a co-producer  \nSample credits  \n* \"Amen\" contains an interpolation of \"Minute by Minute\", written by Lester Abrams and Michael McDonald, and performed by The Doobie Brothers  \n* \"Freak Show\" contains a sample from \"Slob on My Knob\", written by Jordan Houston and Paul Beauregard, and performed by Tear Da Club Up Thugs  \n## Personnel  \nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.  \n* Jeremih – uncredited vocals (7)  \n* Finis \"KY White\" – mixing (1, 2, 7, 14)  \n* Fabian Marasciullo – mixing (14)  \n* Chris Athens – mastering (3)  \n* Justin Smith – mastering (3)  \n## Charts  \n### Weekly charts  \n### Year-end charts  \n## Certifications\n\nQuestion: Which artist was featured on the track \"Believe It\" from the album \"Dreams and Nightmares\"?\nChoice list: \nA.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 26th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Chloé Zhao, who wrote the screenplay with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo. It stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. In the film, the Eternals, immortal alien beings, emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their ancient counterparts, the Deviants.  \nIn April 2018, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige announced that a film based on the Eternals was in development and would explore the group as ancient aliens living throughout human history. Ryan and Kaz Firpo were hired to write the script, and Zhao was set to direct in September. She was given significant creative freedom to rewrite the script, taking especial inspiration from Terrence Malick's films, and to use more locations and natural lighting than previous MCU films had. Casting began in early 2019 and Burleigh joined to work on the script ahead of principal photography, which took place from July 2019 to February 2020 at Pinewood Studios and on location in England and the Canary Islands.  \nEternals premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 18, 2021, and was released in the United States on November 5 as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film grossed $402 million worldwide but it underperformed due to its high budget and marketing costs. It received generally mixed reviews, with praise for the visuals, cinematography, performances and score, but criticism for the screenplay and runtime.  \n## Plot  \nIn 5000 BC, ten superpowered beings known as Eternals—Ajak, Sersi, Ikaris, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, Gilgamesh, and Thena—are sent to Earth by Arishem, a Celestial, on the starship Domo. They are charged with exterminating invasive entities known as the Deviants. The last Deviants are apparently killed in 1521, when the group's opinions differ over their continued relationship with humankind. Over the next five hundred years, they mostly live apart, waiting for Arishem's orders.  \nIn the present day, Sersi and Sprite live together in London. After Sersi's partner Ikaris left her without explanation centuries earlier, she is now in a relationship with human Dane Whitman who works at the Natural History Museum. When the trio are attacked by the Deviant Kro, Ikaris arrives and chases the creature away. The three Eternals travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find her dead. Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem.  \nSersi learns that the Eternals' mission was actually to prepare Earth for the Emergence of a new Celestial. Arishem explains that, for millions of years, he has been planting Celestial seeds inside planets where the energy from large populations allows new Celestials to be born. The Deviants were sent to destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life, but when they evolved and began hunting the planets' native populations, Arishem created the Eternals to counter them. With the recent end of the Blip restoring Earth's population,efn|As depicted in Avengers: Endgame (2019) humankind has reached the necessary size to allow the Celestial Tiamut to be born, which will result in Earth's destruction.  \nHoping to delay the Emergence, the Eternals reunite. At Druig's residence in the Amazon rainforest, they are attacked by the Deviants. They kill them all except for Kro, who kills Gilgamesh before fleeing. Phastos proposes they use the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals that would give Druig enough power to put Tiamut to sleep with his mind-control abilities. However, Ikaris is loyal to Arishem and refuses to help stop the Emergence. He reveals that Ajak wanted to stop the Emergence and save humanity, so he led her to the Deviants and allowed them to kill her. Sprite joins Ikaris due to her unrequited love for him while Kingo chooses to leave.  \nMakkari locates the place of the Emergence, an active volcano in the Indian Ocean, where Ikaris and Sprite attempt to stop them. Druig knocks out Sprite, and Phastos restrains Ikaris. Kro arrives and is killed by Thena. Druig is unable to put Tiamut to sleep, and Sersi instead attempts to turn him into marble. Ikaris breaks free of his restraints and goes to kill Sersi, but is unable to due to his love for her. Both he and Sprite join with the others in the Uni-Mind, and Sersi gains enough power to turn Tiamut into marble. Guilt-ridden, Ikaris flies into the Sun. Sersi uses the remaining Uni-Mind energy to turn Sprite into a human, ending her permanent childlike state.  \nThena, Druig, and Makkari depart on the Domo to warn Eternals on other planets of the Emergences. Whitman professes his love for Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, Phastos, and Kingo are lifted into space by Arishem. Displeased with their treason, Arishem says he will spare humanity if the Eternals' memories show that humans are worthy of living. He vows to return for judgment and takes the trio into a singularity.  \nIn a mid-credits scene, Thena, Makkari, and Druig meet the Eternal Eros and his assistant Pip the Troll. In a post-credits scene, an unseen personefn|Identified off-screen as Blade questions whether Whitman is ready to wield the Ebony Blade.  \n## Cast  \n<image>The cast of Eternals at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con (L to R): Madden, Nanjiani, Ridloff, Henry, Hayek, McHugh, Lee, and Jolie\n* Gemma Chan as Sersi:An empathetic Eternal with a strong connection to humanity and the Earth, who can manipulate and transform matter through physical contact. Sersi has been in love with Ikaris for centuries and has a strong connection with Sprite. In the present day, she is a museum curator on Earth and dating Dane Whitman. Producer Kevin Feige said Sersi was the lead character of the film. Director Chloé Zhao said she and Chan were interested in creating the kind of nuanced female superhero that they felt was rarely seen in the genre, and Zhao felt Chan had imbued the character with gentleness, compassion, and vulnerability that would \"invite viewers to rethink what it means to be heroic\". Chan said Sersi was free-spirited and loved being around humans.  \n* Richard Madden as Ikaris:A powerful Eternal who can fly and project cosmic energy beams from his eyes. Speaking to the relationship between Ikaris and Sersi, Madden said the fact that they had loved each other for centuries showed a \"deep level of romance\" between the two. They are on opposing sides of how the Eternals connect to the world, with Sersi having compassion for humans while Ikaris is more disconnected. The biggest struggle for Madden was showing that Ikaris has \"seen everything and done everything\" without the character coming across as bored. Zhao's take on Ikaris was influenced by director Zack Snyder's interpretation of Superman in Man of Steel (2013) which left a strong impression on her for its \"authentic and very real\" approach.  \n* Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo:An Eternal who can create cosmic energy projectiles. Enamored with fame, Kingo becomes a popular Bollywood film star to blend in on Earth. Nanjiani wanted to combine the wisecracking attitude of John McClane from the Die Hard film series with the look of Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan, and also studied Errol Flynn films and some of the original Zorro films to help emulate \"old school Hollywood stars whose characters really enjoyed fighting\". Nanjiani, who is not a dancer, grew up watching Bollywood dance sequences and spent several months training for the film's own such sequence in hopes of capturing the same energy and joy.  \n* Lia McHugh as Sprite:An Eternal who can project life-like illusions. Sprite is in a permanent childlike state, appearing as a young girl despite being thousands of years old. The film explores her struggles with this, including her jealousy of humans who can grow old, know love, and have families. She has an unrequited love for Ikaris which Kingo compares to that of Tinker Bell for Peter Pan. Similarly, Neil Gaiman and John Romita Jr.'s 2006 Eternals comic book miniseries compared Sprite to the never-aging Peter Pan and gave them similar short, red hair, which the film also uses. The film ends with Sprite becoming human and being able to grow old.  \n* Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos: An Eternal and an intelligent weapons and technology inventor. He is the first superhero to be depicted as gay in an MCU film.  \n* Lauren Ridloff as Makkari:An Eternal who can move at superhuman speed. The character is the first deaf superhero in the MCU. After starting to run more in anticipation of the role, she shifted to muscle building in order to have \"the symmetry of somebody who looks like a sprinter\".  \n* Barry Keoghan as Druig: An aloof Eternal who becomes frustrated with the inaction of the other Eternals in human affairs. He can manipulate the minds of others.  \n* Don Lee as Gilgamesh:The strongest Eternal, with a deep connection to Thena. Lee pursued the role in order to be an inspiration to the younger generation as the first Korean superhero, and was able to utilize his boxing training for the role.  \n* Kit Harington as Dane Whitman: A human who works at the Natural History Museum in London as a history professor and is dating Sersi.  \n* Salma Hayek as Ajak:The wise and spiritual leader of the Eternals, who has the ability to heal and is the \"bridge\" between the Eternals and the Celestials. Changing the character from a man in the comics allowed Hayek to lean into Ajak's femininity and make her the \"mother figure\" of the Eternals. Hayek was initially hesitant to work with Marvel, assuming she would have a supporting or \"grandmother\" role.  \n* Angelina Jolie as Thena:An elite warrior Eternal who can form any weapon out of cosmic energy and develops a close bond with Gilgamesh over the centuries. She also suffers from a psychological condition called Mahd Wy'ry. Jolie trained with various swords, spears, and staffs for the role, as well as taking ballet.  \nAdditionally, Bill Skarsgård provides the voice of Kro, one of the Deviants, and David Kaye voices the Celestial Arishem. Harish Patel appears as Karun, Kingo's human valet; Haaz Sleiman and Esai Daniel Cross respectively portray Phastos's husband Ben and son Jack; and Zain Al Rafeea plays a villager who comes across the Eternals when they first arrive on Earth. Harry Styles appears in the mid-credits scene as Eros / Starfox, the brother of MCU character Thanos, while Patton Oswalt voices Eros's assistant Pip the Troll. Mahershala Ali has an uncredited voice-only cameo as Blade in the post-credits scene ahead of starring in his own film.\n\n## Production  \n### Development  \n<image>Director Chloé Zhao promoting Eternals at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con\nMarvel Studios president Kevin Feige said in April 2018 that the studio was actively developing a film based on the Marvel Comics series Eternals, created by Jack Kirby, to be released as part of their Phase Four slate of films. Marvel Studios had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character Sersi in the film. Marvel set Ryan and Kaz Firpo to write the script a month later, with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and Ikaris. In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" by having the Eternals be the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).  \nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for Eternals narrowed to a shortlist that included Chloé Zhao—who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's Black Widow (2021)—Nicole Kassell, Travis Knight, and the pair of Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra. Zhao approached Marvel Studios about making the film as she had been a fan of the MCU. She wanted to work with the studio to bring her own take and world-building to the franchise, and impressed them with a presentation that Feige described as fascinating, with \"reams of visuals\". Zhao worked with producer Nate Moore to develop her pitch. The presentation left Marvel concerned that she might take on a different big-studio project instead of Eternals, forcing them to move quickly to secure her, and Zhao was hired as director in September. Zhao hoped to push the scope of the film further than Marvel's Avengers: Endgame (2019), but also wanted it to have intimacy. Zhao described the film as a melting pot of influences, from Kirby's original work, Neil Gaiman's 2006 run, previous MCU projects, Zhao's fandom of the MCU, and her love of science fiction and fantasy films and manga. Speaking specifically to her love of manga, she hoped those influences would create a \"marriage of East and West\". Zhao cited the TV series Ancient Aliens, the Final Fantasy video game series, the concepts from Yuval Noah Harari's book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, and the films of Terrence Malick as her inspirations for the film.  \nMarvel considered Eternals to be a perfect transition into its next phase of films along with projects such as Captain Marvel (2019), allowing the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals. Moore's initial planning documents for the project including the swapping of genders, sexualities, and ethnicities of some characters from the comic books, with Zhao further advocating for this approach. In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the Eternals due to Kirby's epic, century-spanning story, with the film version spanning 7,000 years and exploring humanity's place in the cosmos. Zhao noted that the Eternals \"have lived among us for so long, they have the same struggles like identity, purpose, faith, personal freedom versus greater good — all the duality and flaws that make us human\". When trying to develop a story that spanned so many years, Marvel realized that the characters would likely be a family unit, with friendship that would \"turn into frenemies, and then turn into enemies, and then come back to friendship\". Zhao also looked to the Earth as an eleventh character in the film, chronicling its journey alongside the Eternal characters. Marvel also wanted to create more ensemble films that were not crossover films, like Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), while introducing relatively unknown characters to audiences as they did with that film's title characters and the Avengers.\n\n### Pre-production  \nThroughout early 2019, Zhao began working on a draft of the script, building upon the multiple drafts submitted by the Firpos. Approximately four months ahead of filming, the script was not finalized, so Moore introduced Patrick Burleigh, who had been part of Marvel's writers program, to Zhao in the hopes he could assist with the writing. Zhao hired him to work on the screenplay, which he did for about three months ahead of filming. Burleigh believed Zhao needed to write on the film as well as direct to \"process the film through her own filter\", and noted her draft showed she was \"trying to make the Terrence Malick version of a Marvel film\"; Zhao citing his film The Tree of Life (2011) as an inspiration. Burleigh called his work with Zhao on the script mostly \"structural\" to find \"the flow of the film\", likening the story to a road trip film.  \nAngelina Jolie joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi, with Kumail Nanjiani and Don Lee cast in undisclosed roles the next month. At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero. In May, Richard Madden entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris, and Salma Hayek had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role the following month. In July, Variety reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and Millie Bobby Brown, but Brown denied that she had been cast.  \nAt the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige officially announced The Eternals with a release date of November 6, 2020. He officially announced the casting of Jolie as Thena, Nanjiani as Kingo, Lee as Gilgamesh, Madden as Ikaris, and Hayek as Ajak, along with Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, and Lia McHugh as Sprite. Zhao looked for actors for each role that could \"find a bit of themselves in their character\". Feige added that one of these actors was portraying an LGBTQ character, with actor Haaz Sleiman later revealing that Phastos is depicted as gay in the film. Sleiman portrays the character's husband, and the pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was important to depict \"how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction in some previous media. Feige said the relationship was \"always sort of inherent in the story\" and he felt it was \"extremely well done\" in the film, while Sleiman said it was a \"thoughtful\" depiction.  \nEternals is set around eight months after the events of Avengers: Endgame, and addresses why the Eternals did not interfere in any past conflicts in the MCU. Both Feige and Moore said the film would have \"major ripple effects\" on the future of the MCU, and at times, it was \"a challenge\" to balance the grounded nature of the MCU with the \"mythic grandeur\" of the Eternals property.  \n### Filming  \nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, principal photography had begun at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. Ben Davis served as director of photography, after doing so on several previous MCU films. Zhao said Marvel Studios allowed her creative freedom to shoot the film on location, \"exactly the way she wanted to shoot\" it. She was able to use a similar style to her previous films, including 360° shots and working with the same camera and rigs as were used for her film Nomadland (2020), which Zhao was set to complete back-to-back with The Eternals. Zhao felt that she \"got lucky in that Marvel wants to take risks and do something different.\" Zhao cited The Revenant (2015) as a primary influence when composing the film's action sequences.  \nGemma Chan and Barry Keoghan were in talks to join the cast in August 2019. Chan previously portrayed Minn-Erva in Captain Marvel, but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film. Since Minn-Erva dies in that film, Chan had felt that it was unlikely she would return to the MCU, but after working on the film she was told by Feige that the studio wanted to \"make better use\" of her in a future project. This led to Chan auditioning for Sersi, one of the last actresses to be considered for the role. Chan later described Sersi as the most difficult role for the film to cast. Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast in the film at the D23 Expo in August, in the roles of Sersi and Druig, respectively, along with Kit Harington as Dane Whitman. Chan said she and Marvel Studios were surprised by how soon after Captain Marvel her new MCU role came, with both assuming that it would have been a project further in the future. Harish Patel was cast at the end of August as Karun, Kingo's manager, and filmed his role from September 2019 until January 2020.  \nBy early November, filming took place in the Canary Islands. The filming cast and crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of Fuerteventura when an explosive device was found there. The device was thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base. Later that month, Zain Al Rafeea joined the cast. In early January 2020, filming took place outside the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in Oxford, England, as well as Hampstead Heath and in Camden in London, under the working title Sack Lunch. Chan said the filming process felt very different from what she experienced on Captain Marvel, explaining that Eternals shot more on location and utilized natural light while Captain Marvel had more studio work and bluescreen. Filming wrapped on February 4, 2020.  \n### Post-production  \nIn March 2020, Scanline VFX, one of the companies working on the film's visual effects, confirmed that they would be working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial Light & Magic, Luma Pictures, RISE, and Weta Digital also worked on the film's visual effects. In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, moving The Eternals release date to February 12, 2021. In August, the film's title was officially shortened from The Eternals to Eternals, and the next month, the release date was pushed back to November 5, 2021. Reshoots had taken place by mid-November 2020.  \nAdditional filming occurred in Los Angeles in early February, also under the working title Sack Lunch. Dylan Tichenor and Craig Wood serve as co-editors of the film. Tichenor said Zhao usually edits her own films and has \"strong opinions\", but on Eternals she was relying on Tichenor and Wood due to the size of the production and the ongoing awards season for Nomadland. Tichenor added that Zhao respected the pair's editing experience and point of view, and they made their first cut of the film without much input from her. They began adjusting the film based on Zhao's feedback, and were still working on the editing in April 2021. At the end of the month, Zhao said editing for the film was in its \"final stretch\", and Jashaun St. John was revealed to appear in the film, after previously starring in Zhao's film Songs My Brothers Taught Me (2015).  \nAt the end of May 2021, with the release of the first teaser trailer and poster for the film, the official writing credits were revealed: Zhao was credited as the screenwriter, both as a solo contributor and as part of a writing team with Burleigh, while Ryan and Kaz Firpo received story credit. Additionally, Gil Birmingham was revealed to have been cast in the film, although he was absent in the final film. In July 2021, Writers Guild of America West presented the film's final writing credits, awarding Ryan and Kaz Firpo screenplay credit along with Zhao and the team of Zhao and Burleigh, in addition to their story credit. Moore believed the studio had \"bit off as much as we could chew\" with the film, creating one that \"felt urgent and present and had a fast pace, but also took time to reflect back over the centuries\".  \nAt the film's world premiere, Matt Donnelly of Variety tweeted that Harry Styles made an appearance in a post-credits scene as Eros, Thanos' brother in the comics, which was not shown in early press screenings of the film. Zhao later revealed that she \"kept tabs on Styles\" since his appearance in Dunkirk (2017), believing that he \"makes me think of Eros as a character\". WWE wrestler Becky Lynch had a role in the film for a planned post-credits scene that was intended to set up a future project. The scene was removed for being reportedly \"too depressing\".  \n## Music  \nRamin Djawadi composed the score for the film, after previously doing so for Marvel's Iron Man (2008). Two songs from the film's soundtrack, \"Across the Oceans of Time\" and \"Eternals Theme\", were released as singles on October 22, 2021, while the full album was released on November 3.  \n## Marketing  \n<image>Select costumes from the film on display as part of the Futures exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution\nThe first footage of the film was released in May 2021 as part of a promotional video from Marvel Studios celebrating their films and a return to movie theaters. Though the footage was limited and \"vague\", Hoai-Tran Bui at /Film still felt it was \"very exciting\". Chaim Gartenberg of The Verge felt one of the biggest moments of the footage was seeing Jolie wielding a sword made of light. He was also encouraged that Eternals appeared to be one of Marvel's first films to \"deliver on their years-long promise of creating films with more diverse casts\". Nerdist Michael Arbeiter said the footage was quick, but felt that it \"manages an air of wonderment\".  \nThe first teaser for the film was released on May 24, 2021. Gartenberg felt the teaser was light on plot elements, with it instead focusing on the \"civilization-spanning scope of the superhero team and its members throughout human history\". He also believed the film was \"a big swing\" from Marvel Studios to entice audiences with a lesser-known comics property, but believed that it would succeed due to its diverse cast of well-known actors and Zhao's status as \"one of the most exciting directors around\". io9 Charlies Pulliam-Moore felt the trailer was a \"multiple millennia-spanning recap of Earth's history\", and said it was unclear how much the larger MCU would impact on the film outside of a brief reference to the Avengers at the end of the trailer. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Nick Romano felt the teaser was a combination of \"thrilling, goosebump-inducing moments\" and some jokes. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club felt the spot teased some fresh angles for the MCU in a similar way to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and he enjoyed the images of Kingo's Bollywood dance, Sprite performing karaoke, and the end scene of the Eternals eating together and joking about the Avengers. After seeing the teaser, Variety Adam B. Vary described the film as \"unquestionably a Chloé Zhao movie\", but wished more action set pieces were featured in the teaser to see how Zhao would approach them in the film. Adele Ankers of IGN discussed the poster that was released at the same time as the trailer, highlighting how the Eternals appear in silhouette against a sunlit background which she described as \"another taste of Chloé Zhao's signature filming style and the use of natural light to illuminate a frame\" that would be seen in the film. Upon release, the teaser quickly became the number one trending video on YouTube and amassed 77 million global views in its first 24 hours. Disney's president of marketing Asad Ayaz said the teaser was designed to just be an introduction to the characters and tone and not give much of the film away, adding the marketing team would be \"very judicious\" on when more material would be revealed, while also using the releases of Black Widow and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings before Eternals to help expose audiences to the characters.  \nThe final trailer was released in August 2021, with Ethan Shanfeld and Manori Ravindran of Variety feeling it was \"more serious in tone\" than the teaser with the Eternals \"grappling with the prospect of emerging after centuries living apart in order to help humans\". Entertainment Weekly Devan Coggan felt that the trailer was the \"best glimpse yet\" of the film and gave a \"sense of the vast scale and scope of the film\", while answering \"one important question\" about the absence of the Eternals during the conflict against Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Aaron Couch at The Hollywood Reporter said the trailer \"reveals much of the film's plot as well as its characters' powers, teasing the answers to key questions about who the Eternals answer to, their relationship to Earth and why they ultimately didn't intervene\" in the conflict against Thanos.  \nIn October 2021, Lexus released a commercial promoting the film and its Lexus IS 500 sports sedan starring Nanjiani as Kingo, with frequent MCU directors Joe and Anthony Russo guiding its development and Framestore working on the visual effects. Lexus created ten concept cars based on the ten Eternals characters from the film. The LS 500h and NX are featured in the film. Beginning on November 20, 2021, select costumes from the film were part of the Futures exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution's Arts and Industries Building, which ran through July 2022. Behind-the-scenes content looking at the evolution of the film's visuals as well as an augmented reality experience were also included in the exhibit.\n\n## Release  \n### Theatrical  \nEternals had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 18, 2021, and was screened at the Rome Film Festival on October 24. The film was released theatrically in many European countries on November 3, and in the United States and the United Kingdom on November 5 in RealD 3D and 4DX. In September 2021, Disney announced that the film would have an exclusive theatrical release for a minimum of 45 days. Eternals was previously set for release on November 6, 2020, before it was shifted to February 12, 2021, and then to the November 2021 date, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.  \n#### Censorship  \nIn May 2021, a Chinese state media report excluded Eternals, as well as Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, from its list of upcoming MCU films releasing, which Variety noted \"added to rumors\" that the films would not be released in China, especially since Zhao had become \"an unexpected persona non grata\" in the country after she was scrutinized by Chinese netizens over her remarks in a 2013 interview with Filmmaker magazine in which she described China as \"a place where there are lies everywhere\". By September 2021, Deadline Hollywood reported it remained \"an open question\" if the Chinese government or Zhao would attempt to \"rehabilitate\" the situation, but it \"seems likely\" the film would not be released in China following the country's response to Nomadland as well as Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings likely not being released in the country either following backlash to comments made by star Simu Liu in 2017.  \nThe film was not released in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman due to the depiction of a gay couple. Theaters in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt were set to show an edited version of the film which is missing all the love scenes.  Angelina Jolie criticized the countries' decision to ban the film, saying: \"I'm sad for those audiences. And I'm proud of Marvel for refusing to cut those scenes out. I still don't understand how we live in a world today where there's still people who would not see the family Phastos has and the beauty of that relationship and that love. How anybody is angry about it, threatened by it, doesn't approve or appreciate it is ignorant.\" Lebanese actor Haaz Sleiman, who played Phastos' husband Ben in the film, also voiced the same reaction towards the matter: \"They stood their ground and said, 'Nope, we are not going to compromise the integrity of our film.' It made these Arab countries looks so ignorant and pathetic. I have no respect for those governments. They have displayed to the world that they are not only a disgrace to humanity, but to God. Hopefully this will inspire the Saudi people, the Kuwaiti people and the people in Qatar to fight back.\" Marvel later agreed to cut any kind of love scenes, including the gay couple kiss for the film's release in Indonesia, which received praise by the Indonesian Film Censorship Board (LSF).  \n### Home media  \nEternals began streaming on Disney+ on January 12, 2022, with the option to view the theatrical version of the film or an IMAX Enhanced version. Audio commentary and additional bonus features for the film were added to Disney+ in March 2022. It was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on February 15. The home media includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.  \nAccording to Samba TV, Eternals was watched by 2 million U.S. households during its first five days on Disney+. Eternals was also the top streaming film for viewers in the United States for the week ending January 16, 2022, according to Whip Media's TV Time.  \n## Reception  \n### Box office  \nEternals grossed $164.9million in the United States and Canada, and $237.2million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $402.1million. The film's opening weekend earned $162 million globally, which was the second-largest worldwide opening weekend in the COVID-19 pandemic for a Hollywood film, of which IMAX contributed to over $13.6 million.  \n#### Pre-sale tickets and projections  \nAdvanced ticket sales for Eternals were estimated to be $2.6 million in its first 24 hours, outpacing those for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings ($1.4 million) and Black Widow ($2 million) during the same time frame, while AMC Theatres had the largest first day sales of 2021 for the film. In November, Fandango reported that pre-sales for Eternals were second-largest of 2021, behind Black Widow. In October, Boxoffice Pro initially projected that the film would earn $82–102 million within its opening weekend, and around $210–280 million in total domestic box office. At the end of the month, Boxoffice Pro modified their projections to $67–92 million for the film's opening weekend, and around $165–215 million in total domestic box office, due to mixed early critical reception. According to Deadline Hollywood, Eternals was expected to earn $75 million within its domestic opening weekend, and around $150 million globally.  \n#### Performance  \nIn the United States and Canada, Eternals earned $30.7 million in its opening day, which included $9.5 million from Thursday night previews, marking the third-largest opening day of the pandemic, behind Black Widow and Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Its opening weekend earned $71.3 million from 5.5 million theater admissions, making it the top film of the weekend. IMAX accounted for over $7.6 million of the weekend. This marked the fourth-largest opening weekend of the pandemic. The domestic opening weekend gross was lower than various pre-release projections. Deadline attributed this to the film's overall mixed reception from critics and audiences. In its second weekend, Eternals remained the top film, grossing over $27.5 million. Eternals became the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2021 in the United States.  \nOutside of North America, Eternals earned over $90.7 million within its opening weekend from 46 markets. It was number-one in nearly all of these markets. The international opening weekend gross had exceeded various pre-release projections. IMAX contributed to $6 million of the opening gross, from 58 countries. The film scored the largest opening of the pandemic in Italy, Brazil, and Hong Kong. In South Korea, Eternals earned $14.4 million, marking the largest debut for a Hollywood film amid the pandemic. In Russia, the film earned an opening of $5.4 million through six days. In its second weekend, Eternals earned $48 million from 49 markets, a drop of 49%. It remained number one in many of these territories. The following weekend, the film earned $22.7 million. It was the top film of the weekend internationally, remaining the top film in many territories, including all markets across Latin America, except for Mexico. As of November 28, 2021, the film's largest markets were South Korea ($26.4 million), the United Kingdom ($18.7 million), France ($14.9 million), Mexico ($14.3 million), and Brazil ($11.1 million).  \n### Critical response  \nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of score based on count reviews, with an average rating of average. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An ambitious superhero epic that soars as often as it strains, Eternals takes the MCU in intriguing—and occasionally confounding—new directions.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Upon release, it became the lowest-rated MCU film on both websites and the first installment to be classified as \"rotten\" on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest grade for an MCU film, and PostTrak reported 78% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.  \nCharlotte O'Sullivan of the Evening Standard described the film as \"lavish\" and \"ambitious\", and praised the fight sequences as \"astounding, beautifully paced and crammed with detail\". Robert Abele of TheWrap commended the cinematography and felt \"an earnestness to the operatic stakes\". Oliver Jones of the Observer called it \"full of wonder and romance and fueled by an agenda and audacity all its own\". Owen Gleiberman was disappointed over Zhao's missing filmmaking style that shaped her films The Rider (2017) and Nomadland (2020) to \"embrace the straight-up expository conventionality of Marvel filmmaking\", but felt that the film was a \"squarely fun and gratifying watch\". Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times thought \"it's got some pretty slow spots midfilm and it's desperately in need of a bit more wit... what it does have is a palpable, artful mood; this is a movie full of superheroes who spend time thinking and feeling, and of special effects that aren't just zippy but often delicately elegant\".  \nLinda Marric of The Jewish Chronicle described it as \"a mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just about saved by some half decent performances\"; Nicholas Barber of BBC Culture called Zhao's direction \"workmanlike\"; and Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent said that it \"strives for the same expansive soulfulness\" as Nomadland \"but discovers there's room enough only for the occasional burst of it\". Brian Truitt of USA Today praised Zhao's \"penchant for naturalistic environments\", but wrote that the narrative \"struggles to juggle its many subplots and tries to do too much\". Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press criticized the dialogue and fight scenes, but praised the visual effects and Nanjiani's performance. Shirley Li of The Atlantic felt that \"Zhao's delicate examination of her characters outshines Eternals duller and more convoluted moments\".  \nRobbie Collin wrote the film was \"constantly engaged in a kind of grit-toothed authenticity theatre, going out of its way to show you it's doing all the things proper cinema does, even though none of them bring any discernible benefit\"; Kevin Maher felt \"a strange self-sabotaging energy at the heart\"; and Steve Rose of The Guardian missed \"the breezy wit of Marvel's best movies... like coming into Avengers: Endgame cold without having seen any of the preceding installments\". K. Austin Collins of Rolling Stone felt that the film was \"good at telling us where to look, at impressing us with its manufactured sense of grandeur\", but lacked \"any credible sense of what's actually worth seeing\". Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times had a \"depressing realization that you've just seen one of the more interesting movies Marvel will ever make, and hopefully the least interesting one Chloé Zhao will ever make\". Brian Lowry of CNN thought \"the movie's structural flaws offset its stunning visuals and strong performances\". Kyle Smith of National Review was harsher, describing it as \"one of the dumbest, cheesiest, most trite, and least human\" of the MCU films.  \nThe mixed reception surprised some commentators, given the MCU's positive track record and the acclaim of Zhao's previous work. Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"much of the criticism of Kirby's work\", which was divisive for its subject matter and relationship to the wider Marvel Universe, \"has followed Zhao in her adaptation.\" He compared the divisive response to that of Zack Snyder's DC Extended Universe films Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), writing that they and Eternals share \"a deconstructive approach to superheroes and force them to question their purpose in the world, through meditative and melancholy narrative beats, and a tragic yet hopeful ending.\" This approach, he felt, subverted critics and audiences' expectations, which made them review the film more harshly. Zhao addressed some of the criticisms of the film, believing some of the divisiveness came from everyone \"having an existential crisis\" because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the film being an \"existential crisis, both for humanity and God\". She also felt the reactions to how the film incorporated her filmmaking sensibilities with Marvel's were \"a testament to how much we had merged with each other; how uncomfortable that might make people feel\".  \n### Accolades  \nThe film was given the Seal of Authentic Representation from the Ruderman Family Foundation for Ridloff's role as Makkari. The seal is given to films and series that feature actors with disabilities who have at least five lines of dialogue. Eternals was also one of 28 films that received the ReFrame Stamp for 2021, awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame for films that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring.  \n## Documentary special  \nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The special on this film, Assembled: The Making of Eternals, was released on Disney+ on February 16, 2022.  \n## Future  \nIn October 2021, Zhao said she was open to making a sequel. The next month, Kaz and Ryan Firpo expressed interest in making a prequel series for Disney+ that would focus on one Eternal in a different time period each episode, such as an episode about Thena in Ancient Greece and one about Kingo in 1890s Mumbai where he balances his life as a film star with Mahatma Gandhi's campaign for India's independence from British rule. They also felt there were opportunities to continue the film's story by further exploring Dane Whitman and showing the Eternals confronting the Celestials. Chan said in January 2022 that she would reprise the role of Sersi in the future. Feige was asked about Styles's future in the MCU that July and said Marvel Studios was excited to further explore the characters Eros and Pip as part of the MCU's more cosmic stories. A month later, Oswalt said a sequel had been confirmed by Marvel Studios and Zhao was returning to direct. In October, Moore said Marvel intended to bring back the Eternals characters in the future of the MCU. Nanjiani said the following month that he was unaware of a sequel and believed Oswalt was mistaken, but expressed interest in reprising his role as Kingo. Don Lee's talent agency indicated in December that he would reprise his role as Gilgamesh in an Eternals sequel. Oswalt clarified his statements in February 2023, saying a sequel was not in development at that time and that he had been misled.\n\nQuestion: Which character from the film \"Eternals\" has the ability to move at superhuman speed and is also noted as the first deaf superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Hunting wasp  \n<image>Pompilidae, Tachypompilus ignitus, a typical spider-hunting wasp, has paralysed a female Huntsman spider, and is dragging it up a wall to the intended shelter\n\n<image>Sphecidae, Ammophilinae, Eremnophila aureonotata transporting a paralysed prominent caterpillar to the nest she has excavated\n\n<image>katydid paralysed by a Sphecid wasp, and left outside the tunnel while the wasp performs a final inspection of the interior.\n\n<image>European hornet, Vespa crabro germana, butchering a bee before carrying the worthwhile portions back to the colony for the larvae.\nHunting wasps are members of various taxa of the insect order Hymenoptera. Their habits and affinities vary in many ways, but all practise parental care of their larvae in that they capture prey, usually insects, to feed their larvae. Whether solitary or social, most species construct some form of protection or nest in which they hide the prey and in which the larvae can feed and pupate in reasonable security.  \nMost solitary hunting wasps sting their prey in such a manner as to paralyse it without killing it. As a result it remains fresh for the young to eat. In contrast carnivorous social wasps generally feed prey piecemeal to the larvae as soon as they bring it back to the colony, so there is no need for preservation of the material. A minority of solitary hunting wasps, such as certain Bembicinae, also butcher their prey before feeding it to the larvae.\n\n## Overview  \nHunting wasp is not a biological taxon, but rather describes certain ecological strategies that occur within the Hymenoptera. All hunting wasps are members of the Aculeata, within the Apocrita, but not all Aculeata are hunting wasps.  Nor are the hunting wasps a single clade within the Aculeata; they almost certainly have evolved independently several times, sometimes probably several times within the same family.  Some superfamilies of the Hymenoptera (e.g. Chrysidoidea) include a few taxa that might fairly be called hunting wasps, but no superfamily includes only hunting wasps.  \n### Distinction between hunting wasps and \"solitary wasps\"  \nIn searching literature for \"hunting wasps\" it is prudent to include \"solitary wasps\" in the index terms. The two expressions have been used largely indiscriminately, especially in the very early days of modern entomology. Very few references to \"hunting wasps\" occur before about 1850, whereas references to \"solitary wasps\", though not plentiful, are not unusual.  \nCritically viewed, the terms are not strictly interchangeable. Not all solitary wasps are hunting wasps, nor are all hunting wasps solitary. The term \"solitary wasps\" simply describes those Hymenoptera (especially aculeate Hymenoptera) that are not social, particularly not eusocial. However, it never has been common practice to refer to parasitic Hymenoptera as \"solitary\", even though they definitely are nothing like eusocial, and secondly, some obligately social, even eusocial, Hymenoptera are hunting wasps in the sense of being predominantly predatory (e.g. Vespa and Polistes species). Thirdly, some solitary wasps, such as the Masarinae, are in no sense \"hunting wasps\". (But to avert confusion, consult the article on Euparagia.)  \n### Taxonomy and biology  \nThe taxa considered here are no more than a subset of those detailed in the article on the Apocrita. Nor are they listed here in the same sequence as in that article, but have been rearranged for convenience in discussing hunting wasp biology.  \nIn comparing the various hunting wasp taxa listed here, it is of fundamental importance to bear the following point in mind: supposing that members of one taxon exhibit adaptations to a given life history or biological strategy, and that another taxon has similar adaptations apparently more sophisticated, that need not in itself imply that either is descended from, or relevantly related to, the other. The reason for mentioning such taxa in close context is purely for suggestive illustration. Where the ancestral record of the more sophisticated strategy is unavailable, it often may be reasonable to observe that intermediate stages resembling the mechanisms of extant forms could be perfectly viable. For example, it seems plausible that a digger wasp such as a member of the Sphecidae might have had an ancestor that simply hid prey in available tunnels in much the same way that some Bethylidae still do, but it does not follow that the extant digger Sphecidae are descendants of the Bethylidae.  \nBearing this in mind, and that each of the superfamilies under discussion includes families other than those listed here, families that are in no way hunting wasps, consider the following, consulting the links and references for detailed discussion of the biology:  \n* Superfamily Chrysidoidea  \n* *Family Bethylidae  \n:The Chrysidoidea are not normally regarded as other than parasitoids, parasites, and kleptoparasites. Nor are they seriously considered as hunting wasps in this article, but some members of the family Bethylidae do have very suggestive patterns of reproductive biology. Though the details vary, these members of largely parasitoidal wasp taxa hunt their prey, paralyse them in various ways, including malaxation, drag them off, and conceal them before laying eggs on them. Many variations on the theme occur in the family.  Observation of such members of the Bethylidae provides material of great evolutionary interest. It strongly suggests that various forms of parasitoidal behaviour within the Hymenoptera independently provided preadaptation for the development of typical hunting wasp behaviour.  \n* Superfamily Apoidea  \nAlthough it had long been realised that bees were in essence a natural grouping of wasps that fed primarily on nectar and pollen, it took the development of molecular biology to demonstrate the actual grouping of true bees with the following families of definitive hunting wasps.  \n* *Family Ampulicidae  \nThese cockroach wasps are a popular example of a primitive mode of hunting wasp behaviour; they do not build a secure nest for their prey plus its egg, but conceal it in the most convenient crack or burrow, in which respect their behaviour resembles that of some of the Bethylidae.  \n* *Family Crabronidae  \nA very large family with varied habits and a wide range of prey species. Crabronid species in some taxa concentrate on flies, others on bees, others on cicadas, but the overwhelming majority build tunnels, whether single or branched, with one or more larvae inside.  \n* *Family Sphecidae  \nThese are a widely varied family, including the digger wasps and mud daubers  \n* Superfamily Vespoidea  \n* *Family Pompilidae (spider wasps)  \n* *Family Tiphiidae  \nThese are generally large wasps that hunt subterranean insects, usually beetle larvae. Commonly they do little to conceal the paralysed prey, but lay the egg on it underground.  \n* *Family Vespidae  \nAnother large and varied family. They include the social wasps such as paper wasps and hornets. These are hunting wasps in the sense that they hunt animal food, generally insects, but they do not subtly paralyse them; instead they more or less butcher them and carry the most nutritious portions back to the colony to feed the young progressively. Other Vespidae include the solitary potter wasps, that are classical examples of hunting wasps of the kind that build their nests out of mud. The Masarinae or pollen wasps are the major exception in the family in that they do not hunt at all, but instead feed their larvae pollen and nectar, as many members of the superfamily Apoidea do.  \n## History in literature  \nThe hunting wasps have long been known and have attracted the attention of generations of naturalists, but the term \"hunting wasp\" hardly appeared in literature published before the mid 19th century. Authors more often used the term \"solitary wasp\".  \nProbably the most notable early books on the subject were the French collections of essays by Jean Henri Fabre, which later were translated into English by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos in the early 20th century. There were earlier publications, usually informal, including some by deservedly prominent authors, such as the Peckhams, whose working lives overlapped that of Fabre.  \nHowever, most works before the late 19th century tended to be isolated observations and now require cautious interpretation of the species concerned, partly because most authors were amateurs, and partly because very little work had yet been accomplished along the lines of modern taxonomy. This is no reason to disrespect the authors of the time; even a century later, advances in molecular biology have led to an upheaval in Hymenopteran taxonomy that, however necessary, is a source of cognitive dissonance in workers brought up in the 20th century tradition, and who, for example, never would have thought of classifying hunting wasp taxa among the Apoidea.\n\nQuestion: Which image shows an example of a social wasp, rather than a solitary hunting wasp, engaging with its prey?\nChoice list: \nA.

They are on a basketball court, surrounded by media, official in black, and spectators.  \nThe Australian women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, played in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. The team of twelve included nine Paralympic veterans with fifteen Paralympic Games between them: Bridie Kean,  Amanda Carter, Sarah Stewart, Tina McKenzie, Kylie Gauci, Katie Hill, Cobi Crispin, Clare Nott and Shelley Chaplin. There were three newcomers playing in their first Paralympics: Amber Merritt, Sarah Vinci and Leanne Del Toso. Carter returned to the Gliders' lineup after being sidelined by a crippling elbow injury at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. The Gliders had won silver in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, but had never won gold.  \nThe first stage of the Paralympic competition was the group stage, a round-robin tournament. The Gliders faced a formidable task just to make the finals, as their pool included Brazil, Great Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Canada had beaten the Gliders in 2010, and the Netherlands was rated as one of the competition's best teams. After a narrow victory over Brazil, and an easier one against Great Britain, the Gliders were again defeated by Canada, but won their final match against the Netherlands to finish at the top of their pool. The Gliders went on to win the quarterfinal against Mexico and the semifinal against the United States, but lost to Germany in the final, winning silver.  \n## Background  \nPrior to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, the Australian women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, had won silver at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, and bronze at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, but had never won gold. The announcement of the membership of the Paralympic team was made on 5 July 2012. The team of twelve included nine veterans with 15 Paralympic Games between them: Bridie Kean,  Amanda Carter, Sarah Stewart, Tina McKenzie, Kylie Gauci, Katie Hill, Cobi Crispin, Clare Nott and Shelley Chaplin. Amber Merritt, Sarah Vinci and Leanne Del Toso were  newcomers competing at their first Paralympics. Kean, aged 25, was selected as their captain.  \nThe oldest team member was Amanda Carter, aged 48, who was coming back for a fourth Paralympic games having competed in the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona, the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta and the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, at which she had been sidelined by a crippling elbow injury. She returned to the Gliders' lineup in 2009. The youngest, who had not even been born when Carter had played in Barcelona, was 19-year-old Amber Merritt. British-born Merritt was originally a swimmer, but had been recruited into basketball by Paralympic Hall of Fame coach Frank Ponta. Merritt had averaged 20 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the Gliders' World Challenge series against Japan, Germany and China in Sydney in July 2012, including a game against Germany in which she scored 21 points and eight rebounds. Another young player from whom much was hoped was Cobi Crispin, who had been named Australian Women's Wheelchair Basketball International Player of the Year in 2011, and had since posted impressive performances in the May 2012 Paralympic World Cup in Manchester and the Gliders World Challenge.  \nSource: Basketball Australia; International Games as at 29 August 2012 from Official Results Book, p. 4152.  \n## Group stage  \nThe first part of the competition was the group stage. The Gliders' pool included Brazil, Great Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Canada had defeated them in the bronze medal game at the 2010 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Birmingham in July 2010. The Gliders' head coach, John Triscari, admitted Canada and the Netherlands would be hard to beat:  \n### Brazil  \nReport:  \ncenter|1=Key: Pts = points, Rebs = rebounds, Asts = assists  \nCobi Crispin in the match against Brazil  \nThe Gliders' first game was on 30 August in front of a crowd of 3,288 at the Basketball Arena in Olympic Park in Stratford, London; a venue also known as \"The Marshmallow\". The Gliders had not played Brazil in four years, and what little they knew about them came from watching videotapes.  \nThe scores were tied fifteen times, and at no point were the Australians more than five points in front. With six minutes to go in the final quarter, the Gliders were up by only two points, with the score 45–43. Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she extended her team's lead to 47–43. A technical foul saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game. Brazil then struck back, scoring five unanswered points to tie the score again at 48–48, but Merritt scored one from the paint to put the Gliders back in front. She followed by taking a defensive rebound and then another shot to make it 52–48. Brazil scored once more, but time ran out, and the Gliders won, 52–50. Leading scorers for the Gliders were Crispin with 18 points and Merritt with 16.  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball – Group A Preliminary – Australia vs Brazil – Statistics  \n### Great Britain  \nReport:  \nThe Gliders' next match was against Great Britain, and was held at the North Greenwich Arena, which could accommodate a larger crowd than the Marshmallow. A crowd of 5,331 saw a low-scoring affair. The Gliders concentrated on defence, and led by only 11–5 at quarter time. By halftime, they had extended their lead to 25–11. The third quarter went badly for Team Great Britain, which only scored three more points to Australia's 14, making the score 39–14 at three-quarter time. The final quarter was Great Britain's best, but the score was still 51–24. Merritt and Crispin were again the Gliders' top scorers, with 10 and 8 points respectively, but they moved the ball around, and every Glider except McKenzie scored at least two points. Gary Peel, the British coach, \"preparing to unleash his best impression of Sir Alex Ferguson's hairdryer on his beleaguered team\", was scathing about their performance. \"They know that's not the way we play\", he said, \"and I'm disappointed for the crowd and them because they are tons better than that. It was an absolutely disgraceful effort out there. It really was bad.\"  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball – Group A Preliminary – Australia vs Great Britain – Statistics  \n### Canada  \nReport:  \n<image>alt=Wheelchair basketball players move across the court. Four are from Australia and one from Canada.\nThe Gliders returned to the Marshmallow the next day for a match against Canada, another team considered a strong chance for a medal, in front of a capacity crowd of 7,200. The Gliders squandered early opportunities, and Canada won the first quarter 20–12. Strong defensive play by Nott and Gauci helped the Gliders reverse this in the second, and left Canada with only a one-point 33–32 lead at half time. The second half saw Canada slowly increase their lead, keeping tied with Australia 4–4 in the first half of third, 6–4 in the last half of the third, 6–4 in the first half of the fourth, and 8–6 in the last half of the fourth. Australia's top players were Crispin, who had 13 points and 15 rebounds; Merritt, who earned 16 points; and Chaplin, with eight points, five rebounds and seven assists. The loss raised the prospect that Australia might not make the finals at all, but Crispin remained confident that they could.  \nTriscari identified the Gliders' poor shooting as their critical problem. \"That was a really tough game,\" he said, \"and full credit to Canada, but we can't beat top teams in the world when we only shoot at 34%, that was the key statistic.\" Merritt said that she had \"the utmost respect for Canada. They're a great team, but we'll refocus on the game tomorrow and go out and play like we know we can, the Australian way.\"  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball – Group A Preliminary – Australia vs Canada – Statistics\n\n### Netherlands  \nReport:  \n<image>We focused on stopping a lot of their big players, particularly Beijer, from getting into the keyway, and the girls did a sensational job. Gert Gertjan van der Linden is very hard to coach against because he throws a lot of stuff at you. Tonight, he was the one having to make the changes. Another day, it will probably be me.\nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball – Group A Preliminary – Netherlands vs Australia – Statistics\n\n## Finals  \n### Quarterfinal – Mexico  \nReport:  \nBridie Kean in the match against Mexico  \nThe loss to Canada meant that the Gliders had won three out of four games, the same number as Canada and the Netherlands. Since Australia had lost to Canada by 7 points and defeated the Netherlands by 9, and the Netherlands had defeated Canada by 11 points, a tiebreaker on points differential gave Australia 9 – 7 = +2, Netherlands 11 – 9 = +2, and Canada 7 – 11 = -4.  Canada therefore finished third, while Australia, tied with the Netherlands, was placed ahead of them based on defeating them in their match. As a result, the Gliders topped their pool, and received a quarterfinal berth against Mexico, which had managed to qualify despite only winning one game. Triscari was confident, but was not taking the match lightly. He cautioned the media: No game's easy, you know. We finished on top, so the crossover with the other side is in our favour. But they are by no means easy. We only beat Brazil by two points and Brazil only beat Mexico by two in the PanAm (Parapan championships) play-offs for third and fourth, so it's going to be tough.  \nThe Gliders planned to dominate Mexico early, playing as aggressively against them as they had played against the Netherlands. Australia's first shots at goal were taken by Kean from the free-throw line, but she missed both. Mexico's Lucia Vazquez Delgadillo then opened the scoring to give Mexico a two-point lead, which turned out to be their biggest of the game. Gauci then put points on the scoreboard for the Gliders. Mexico turned the ball over, and Crispin got her first from the paint, assisted by Gauci, which was repeated on the next play, with Stewart providing the assist this time. Mexico scored, but the Gliders responded with another shot from Crispin. On the next play, Gauci stole the ball and charged down the court, but failed to make the shot. Nott then took a defensive rebound, leading to Crispin scoring again. She was also fouled, but missed the resulting free throw. Shortly thereafter, Stewart drew another foul, and made both shots to bring the score to 14–4.  \nAmanda Carter in the match against Mexico  \nThe Gliders put Mexico under intense defensive pressure. Mexico had six team turnovers to the Gliders' one, and wound up with 19 turnovers in total to Australia's 6. Australia scored 18 points from turnovers, compared to 6 for Mexico. Gauci, a two-point player, took a three-pointer to take the score to 17–8. Mexico was unable to recover from Australia's high scoring from  Merritt, who ultimately scored 14 points with 70 per cent shooting, and Crispin, who scored twelve points with 67 per cent shooting. The teams went into the quarter-time break with the score 21 points to 10. Mexico fell further behind in the second quarter. Amanda Carter immediately stole the ball from Mexico, which let Merritt score two points. A few minutes later, Carter, assisted by Chaplin, scored a basket from the paint, and was fouled in the process. A successful free throw made the score 36–16. Another steal by Merritt led to a fast break, bringing her contribution to ten points, and the score to 38–16. At the halftime break, the score was 44–20.  \nIn the third quarter, a team turnover and a series of missed shots by Hill, Kean and Crispin allowed Mexico to outscore Australia by one point, leaving the score at 50–27 at the end of the quarter. The final quarter saw Australia's Del Toso miss a shot at one end, and Mexico's Floralia Estrada Bernal miss one at the other. Stewart also missed, before a Mexican turnover led to the first score of the quarter, by Stewart. Mexico's Rocio Torres Lopez scored in response. Another shot by Stewart missed, but Carter took an offensive rebound, and scored. Turnovers by Kean and Del Toso allowed Mexico to put four points on the board, but successive fouls sent Kean to the free-throw line to score three points in response.  \nMerritt brought the score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game drew to a close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to capitalise on the opportunities, continuing to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball – Quarterfinal – Australia vs Mexico – Statistics  \n### Semifinal – United States  \nReport:  \n<image>Match against USA. Amber Merritt takes a shot. Team USA's Rose Hollermann attempts to block.\nIn the semifinal, the Gliders had to beat the reigning champions, Team USA, in front of a small crowd of 4,428 at the North Greenwich Arena. Team USA had first possession and earned the first points of the game, but both teams' shooting was poor, and the score was only 10–12 at quarter time. The second quarter started with Merritt scoring twice to give Australia the lead 14–12. Team USA turned the ball over to the Gliders several times, but they were unable to capitalise on their strong defence, leaving the score tied at 26–26 at half time. In the third quarter, an early goal by Gauci from outside the paint gave the Gliders the lead. A series of steals gave the Gliders additional shots, most of which they missed, but Team USA gave up a series of turnovers, and their shooting was worse than their rivals', resulting in a 10–0 run by the Gliders. Team USA were unable to score at all until the last minute of the quarter. A hurried goal with seconds to go by Hill saw the Gliders leading 38–28. Team USA would ultimately post 28 turnovers to Australia's 17, and the Gliders would score 12 points from turnovers to Team USA's three. Triscari warned his players, \"They will come back! We have to stop them!\"  \nIn the final quarter, the Australian defence remained strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, who played the entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with four out of five attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40–37 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, in the face of the Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball in the bucket, but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball – Semifinal – Australia vs United States – Statistics\n\n### Gold medal match – Germany  \nReport:  \nThe Gliders would have to defeat Germany in front of a capacity crowd of 12,985 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal. Australia had narrowly defeated the German team 48–46 in the Gliders World Challenge in Sydney a few months earlier, and at that point had beaten them three of the previous four times they had played.  \n<image>Match against Germany. Sarah Stewart takes possession, watched by Germany's Annika Zeyen, Marina Mohnen, Gesche Schünemann, Edina Müller and Maria Kühn, and Australia's Clare Nott.\nOnce again, Stewart took the opening tip. A defensive rebound by Kean after Germany missed two free throws resulted in the Gliders scoring first, with Gauci assisting Crispin. The Gliders used the same game plan that had defeated the United States, employing a strong defence against a normally high-scoring team.  At first, they were successful; with three minutes to go in the quarter, despite several missed shots, Australia was ahead 10–4. In the last minutes, Germany scored ten points that gave them a 10–14 lead at quarter time.  \nIn the second quarter, Germany extended their lead to ten points, but Kean scored a point from a free throw, and then, with seconds left on the clock, stole the ball, enabling Crispin to score, so the Gliders were only seven points behind at half time. The Gliders won the third quarter, but only by 9–8. They still had six points to make up, with strong defences from both teams. Gauci scored the most in this game, with 15 points, including a three-pointer, with five assists and four rebounds. In the end, the Gliders lost by fourteen points, 44–58.  \nTriscari felt that the Gliders did not put enough pressure on the Germans, and that their shooting was not accurate enough. In particular, they scored a dismal one point from twelve attempts from the free throw line. Basketball Australia CEO Kristina Keneally praised the Gliders' efforts. \"The Gliders have been nothing short of brilliant at the Paralympic Games,\" she said, \"and this Silver Medal is just reward for their outstanding performance. This is the Gliders' fourth consecutive Paralympic Medal – a remarkable achievement. All of the players, coaches and support staff have done a fantastic job and we can’t wait to greet them on their return home.\"  \nAmanda Carter and Shelley Chaplin with their medals  \nIn 2013, Keneally announced a four-year development program for the Gliders that included the appointment of a full-time head coach for the first time, based at the National Wheelchair Centre of Excellence at the New South Wales Institute of Sport in Homebush, New South Wales. In May 2013, Tom Kyle was appointed the Gliders' new head coach.  \n\"We have had the opportunity to play Germany a fair bit in our preparation so our game plan was to have strong defensive pressure and take it from there\", Kean told the media. \"It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more.\"  \nIt was not to be. The Gliders did not qualify for the 2016 Rio Paralympics after finishing second to China at the 2015 Asia Oceania Qualifying Tournament.  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball – Gold Medal Game – Statistics  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball – Statistics\n\n\nQuestion: In which image is the Australian wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, playing against the Netherlands?\nChoice list: \nA.

It formed early on October 29 along a cold front to the southeast of the Carolinas. As it moved up the East Coast, its associated snowfall broke records in at least 20 cities for total accumulations, resulting in a rare \"white Halloween\" two days later.  \nThe storm arrived just two months after Hurricane Irene caused extensive power outages and property damage in the Northeast; with the 2011 New England tornado outbreak also causing damage in Western Massachusetts. It dumped snow on trees that were often still in leaf, adding extra weight, with the ground in some areas still soft from a preceding warm, rainy period that increased the possibility trees could be uprooted. Trees and branches that collapsed caused considerable damage, particularly to power lines, with estimates of storm costs ranging between $1 billion and $3 billion. In all, 3.2 million U.S. residences and businesses in 12 states experienced power outages, with the storm also impacting three Canadian provinces.  \nSome customers in Connecticut did not get power back until early November; many outages lasted 11 days. Many communities chose to postpone celebrations of Halloween from two days to a week later as a result, or cancel them entirely. Delays in restoring power led to the resignation of the chief operating officer of Connecticut Light & Power amid widespread criticism of the company's mishandling of both the nor'easter and Irene.  \n## Meteorological history  \n<image>alt=Snow falls in the backyard of a light brown house and garage. In the upper foreground are branches with leaves, mostly red but with some remaining green. A rubber inflatable jack o' lantern is in the lower right corner.\nEarly on October 28, 2011, a ridge over Canada advected an unseasonably cold air mass across the Mid-Atlantic states and New England; at the same time, a surface low-pressure area began developing along the coast of Louisiana. A cold front moved eastward from the Ohio Valley and exited the East Coast of the United States, developing another low pressure area off the coast of the Carolinas on October 29. The remnants of Hurricane Rina had also been absorbed into the developing system. At the same time, an area of precipitation extended from South Carolina through Pennsylvania, mostly falling as rain with some snow observed at higher elevations. By late that morning, the system was producing precipitation over much of the Mid-Atlantic and New England.  \nAs the system moved to the northeast through the day, it produced widespread snow and winds near hurricane-strength north of the cyclone's warm front over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Winds as high as abbr=on were observed in Massachusetts, and the National Weather Service, issued a Hurricane Force Wind Warning for the Gulf of Maine and other high seas off New England. Overnight into October 30, the storm passed south of Nantucket, and it moved over Nova Scotia later that day with a barometric pressure of abbr=on. As it did so, the associated precipitation diminished over New England and moved into Atlantic Canada. As the system moved out into the Atlantic Ocean, it reached a minimum barometric pressure of abbr=on as it passed to the east of the island of Newfoundland late on October 31. By the early morning of November 1, the system had fully moved out to sea. The storm then hit the UK as Cyclone Quinn.\n\n## Preparations  \nBefore the storm was at its strongest, local National Weather Service offices issued winter storm warnings from northwestern Virginia through central New England, as well as winter storm watches from central Maryland through central Maine. Officials anticipated peak snowfall totals to be from cm across much of the region. All warnings were canceled after the storm moved away from the region.  \nalt=A group of small tents in a park with green trees, concrete sidewalks and falling snow, some of which has begun to accumulate on the tents  \nEarly on October 29, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation activated their fleet of salt trucks. In eastern Pennsylvania, the most recent significant snowstorm during October was in 1972. Utility crews prepared additional crews in the event of power outages.  The Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area closed a road due to the storm's threat. Connecticut governor Dan Malloy opened the state's Emergency Operations Center in Hartford, which included members of the transportation, health, and energy departments. Officials opened 41 shelters in Connecticut. Occupy Wall Street protesters pledged to remain in Lower Manhattan's Zucotti Park despite the weather, obtaining coats and blankets.  \n## Snowfall totals and records  \nPrecipitation began falling in North Carolina and Virginia late on October 28. By early the next day, measurable snowfall had been reported from West Virginia through Maryland, and eventually as far north as Maine. The deepest snowfall reported was  abbr=on, at Peru, Massachusetts. At least 20 cities reported record-breaking totals, and the peak of abbr=on in West Milford, New Jersey broke that state's record for highest snowfall in October. Newark, New Jersey's largest city, also broke its all-time October snowfall record with abbr=on. Central Park in Manhattan observed abbr=on, also a record. In fact, this was New York City's 3rd October snowfall on record.Hartford, Connecticut's state capital, observed a record abbr=on, and the highest total in the state was abbr=on in Farmington southwest of Hartford; this, too, broke the state record for an October snowfall.  \nIn Massachusetts, the nor'easter brought wind gusts peaking at abbr=on in Barnstable and, unofficially, abbr=on in Provincetown.  \nAn automated marine weather station at Mount Desert Rock off the coast of Maine recorded a top gust of abbr=on. In Concord, New Hampshire this became the largest 24 hour snowstorm on record.  \n}  \nMaine  \n0  \n160,000  \nMaryland  \n0  \n43,000  \nMassachusetts  \n6  \n420,000  \nNew Brunswick  \n3  \n3,500  \nN/A  \nNew Hampshire  \n0  \n315,000  \nNew Jersey  \n8  \n700,000  \nNew York  \n3  \n300,000  \nNova Scotia  \n0  \n40,000  \nPennsylvania  \n8  \n500,000  \nPrince Edward Island  \n1  \n3,000  \nRhode Island  \n0  \n20,000  \nVermont  \n0  \n7,500  \nVirginia  \n0  \n>4,000  \nWest Virginia  \n0  \n43,000  \nTotal  \n39  \n>3,389,000  \n## Impact  \nThe nor'easter storm became the 14th multibillion-dollar weather-related disaster of 2011, breaking the three-year-old record of nine. Across the Northeast, the combination of high winds and wet, heavy snow downed trees, most of which retained their leaves, did extensive damage. In New York City, a thousand trees were estimated to have fallen in Central Park, far more than had been damaged by Hurricane Irene two months earlier, just as had been reported in Connecticut. The New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx reported that 2,200 trees in the Thain Family Forest, its old-growth forest and the only one remaining in the city from the era prior to European colonization, were damaged. Downed trees caused widespread power outages, leaving over 3 million people without power. In Central Park workers put a priority on making the park safe for the annual New York City Marathon the following weekend.  \n### Fatalities  \nTraffic accidents killed at least six people. Two were electrocuted by downed power lines. Overall, there were 39 deaths.  \n### Transportation  \nThe storm affected transportation across the Northeast. Two rail services were closed in the New York area, and Amtrak service across the region was either delayed or canceled. NJ Transit suspended service on the Morris and Essex Lines until November 1 due to downed wires and branches, and even then was only able to restore service as far west as Lake Hopatcong. North of New York City, Metro-North suspended commuter rail service on the Harlem Line north of North White Plains, leaving passengers marooned on a train at Southeast for 11 hours when fallen trees blocked the tracks in both directions. Service was also suspended on the Port Jervis Line and the New Canaan, Danbury and Waterbury branches of the New Haven Line. Service on the Port Jervis Line and electrified portions of the Harlem Line was restored on Monday; bus service replaced trains between Southeast and Wassaic and on the Danbury and Waterbury branches for the rest of the week.  \n<image>alt=A downed tree with green and yellow leaves suspended by wires next to snow-covered railroad tracks.\nThe storm also disrupted air travel from Pennsylvania through Connecticut. Officials at Newark International Airport canceled all flights after 4 pm on October 29, and flights out of New York's two major airports were delayed by up to five hours. Some flights bound for New York were diverted to Hartford. Several JetBlue flights departing from Bradley International Airport there were stranded on the tarmac for up to seven hours due to the hazardous conditions.  \nSome roads were also affected. Along the Jersey Shore, the nor'easter produced coastal flooding that left Ventnor Heights isolated. Officials closed a portion of the Black Horse Pike in West Atlantic City due to flooding. Further north, the flooding closed five New Jersey state highways in Monmouth and Ocean counties.\n\n### Sports  \nSporting events on Saturday, mostly college and high school football games, were also impacted. Penn State officials limited parking at its home game in State College to 1,500 spaces due to the inclement weather. It was the first Nittany Lions home October football game with measurable snow since record-keeping began in 1896. At West Point, New York, Army defeated Fordham 55–0 in its first home game played in snow since 1985. On Long Island where a windswept mixture of heavy snow and rain fell, a match between Plainview – Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School and Valley Stream Central High School was cancelled after 15 players were treated for hypothermia, prompting the former school district to reconsider game cancellation policies. At another football game on Long Island 10 players were checked and some treated for the condition.  Several players at Farmingdale High School reported extreme fatigue for several weeks following playing in the storm.  \n### Halloween  \nMany traditional Halloween activities were affected by the storm. In communities without electricity, where tree limbs and wires were down, trick-or-treating was delayed until days when it was expected to be back and repairs had made the streets safer. This also occurred in communities where electricity was still fully or partially on but the streets still may have been unsafe. In Sleepy Hollow, New York, a popular destination for the holiday since Washington Irving's classic short story, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is set there, Halloween events were canceled due to the storm and its aftermath. On the other hand, another popular Halloween destination, Salem, Massachusetts, location of the 1692 witch trials, was unaffected due to its minimal snowfall.  \n<image>alt=Children receiving small treats from a table with a shiny orange covering and two small pumpkins on it. One child to the right is in costume as a green turtle. There are adults behind them wearing heavy coats and hats. In the rear is a large brick building with snow on the roof\nSome families were able to compensate for the lost Halloween. They took their children to trick-or-treat in other communities that still had electricity. Residents of Glen Rock, New Jersey, organized a \"trunk-or-treat\" party at the local high school's football field, where children went around to parked sport-utility vehicles. Since many schools had snow days, and there was little to distract children without electricity, many parents insisted on going ahead with the holiday. \"You can't cancel Halloween,\" said a woman in Fairfield, New Jersey. \"The kids are all hyped up. They had no school because there's no electricity and this and that.\" A boy in Lexington, Massachusetts said he now planned to \"buy some candy and eat it myself.\"  \nAt UMass Amherst, the storm caused a power outage over a traditional party weekend at the college that lasted throughout most of the night on Saturday, October 29. While power was largely restored by Sunday, October 30, the campus canceled classes on October 31, and the UMass Campus Center served as a rest location for students and area residents who were still without power. Amherst College saw similar conditions, with the university newspaper reporting that students were taking refuge from power outages in Valentine Dining Hall, with one student describing the response as similar to hurricanes in her home state of Florida.  \nProposals in some communities to hold Halloween the following weekend, or whenever conditions returned to normal, met with protest from some parents. Some considered the October 31 date to be immutable and non-negotiable, so children would have to wait for 2012. \"I don't have control over the calendar, so Halloween is on Halloween, which is the 31st\", said Pat Murphy, mayor of New Milford, Connecticut. She noted the town had managed to celebrate the holiday that day on its village green despite considerable storm damage and continued power outages. Others had already allowed their children some trick-or-treating, and did not want them to indulge in candy a second time within the week.  \nMany school districts were forced by the storm to use up their remaining allotted snow days for the school year, after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee had required some be used near the beginning of the year. The Weston, Connecticut, public schools had already used nine snow days as of November 2, five more than its schedule allowed. Since more snow days would inevitably be used during the upcoming winter, they predicted that  vacation periods planned for later in the year would have to be shortened or canceled, or the school year would have to be extended.  \nThe storm came at a critical time for high school seniors preparing college applications for early decision, and 76 colleges and universities moved those deadlines back to compensate. In Connecticut, Weston High School, which had power, opened its library for students wishing to study or work on their applications; movies were shown in the auditorium.  \nalt=A satellite image of the northeastern United State. A swath of snow covers the ground from the Appalachians in western Virginia through Pennsylvania, northern and central New Jersey, the New York City metropolitan area and Hudson Valley into New England. There are patches of cloud on either side.\n\n### Electrical outages  \nApproximately 1.7 million customers in the Northeast were still without electricity three days after the storm. Temperatures in the region warmed up to above F during the day, but went down to near freezing at night. As powerless houses grew cold, residents bundled up and kept under blankets, went to stay or visit with others who had electricity, or used their car heaters to temporarily warm-up. Some, frustrated by long blackouts after other recent storms, considered leaving the region or moving to cities where power lines were underground.  \nAbout half a million households in New Jersey lost electricity, prompting a state of emergency declaration from governor Chris Christie. He had himself suffered outages both at his personal residence in Mendham and the governor's mansion, Drumthwacket, in Princeton.  \nIn Connecticut, Governor Dannel Malloy declared a state of emergency late on October 29, after 830,000 people lost power, breaking the record set after Hurricane Irene. In the Danbury area, outages were so prolonged that seven school districts had to cancel classes for the following week. A state of emergency was also declared in Massachusetts, which allowed for the activation of the state's National Guard as well as other emergency measures. Due to the power outages and downed trees shortly before Halloween, at least three towns in the state advised delaying trick-or-treating. In New Hampshire, officials opened seven shelters for people who lost heating during the storm. The early snowfall allowed for the opening of ski resorts in Vermont and Maine.  \n<image>alt=A snow-covered road with one small tree down across it, in early morning light. On either side are trees, many still in leaf, heavy and bent with snow.\nAt a November 1 press conference, Governor Malloy estimated that damages in Connecticut would exceed $3 billion. Two days later, close to 700,000 homes and businesses remained without power. A week after the storm, almost 150,000 customers of the state's two utilities had not yet had power restored. Customers still suffering outages continued to cope as best they could, by sleeping at the homes of friends who had already had their electricity restored, taking showers at work and storing perishable foods outside. Power was not restored to all the customers who had lost it in the storm until November 9.  \nMany Connecticut residents were angry with the state's electric utilities, particularly Connecticut Light & Power (CL&P), which serves most of the state, for the long delays in restoring service. By the weekend after the storm, in comparison, most customers in other affected states had already gotten their electricity back. Malloy said they had \"missed their own target\" and ordered an investigation into their preparation and restoration efforts to be led by James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Clinton Administration. An Avon man complained he had not seen any crews in his area since the storm. Some commentators felt Malloy was being too lenient with CL&P, noting that the company had cut its maintenance budget in the preceding year and that smaller public utilities, such as that serving the city of Norwich, had experienced far less power loss and for far less time despite CL&P's customers paying the highest rates in the contiguous United States. Similar complaints had been made after the company had taken a long time to restore service after Hurricane Irene, and three weeks after the nor'easter, Jeff Butler, the company's CEO, resigned.  \nalt=An image showing a large bluish cloud over the Northeastern United States, with the deeper shades of blue representing the greatest snowfall  \nA month after the storm, Malloy released Witt's report, which concluded that \"CL&P was not prepared for an event of this size\". The utility had planned for a worst-case scenario in which 100,000 customers lost power, only one-eighth of those actually affected by the nor'easter. While the report noted that such a storm had not hit in 25 years when the company's emergency plan was drawn up in June, it nevertheless faulted CL&P for merely telling its emergency crews to be on call that weekend, instead of having them wait at predetermined locations. As a result, it was harder to mobilize them when the effects turned out to be far worse than they anticipated despite warnings from the NWS using terms such as \"historic\" and \"catastrophic\" prior to the storm.  \nThe report also said that CL&P did not ask for crews from neighboring states until after the storm, at which point other New England utilities were also seeking help from them. \"Because of that poor preparation, it's not surprising that they didn't, or that they couldn't, respond with enough boots on the ground when the worst-case scenario was compounded by a factor of eight\", said Malloy. The report did praise some aspects of CL&P's response, such as its short call wait times, speedy repairs by crews once they reached their job sites and the absence of death or serious injury among responding utility crews.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image shows an activity that some families used as a substitute for traditional trick-or-treating during a storm that disrupted Halloween celebrations?\nChoice list: \nA.

In 1989 the business of Barton Transport was purchased.  \nIn 1998 Wellglade purchased the Kinchbus business in Loughborough. In January 2010 TM Travel of Sheffield was purchased. In January 2012 Wellglade took over the bus operations of Felix Bus Services.  \nIn December 2011 Tramlink Nottingham took over the running of the Nottingham Express Transit tram network. In April 2012 Centrebus Bowers Coaches operation and services operated from the Dove Holes depot of Wellglade's Trent Barton were combined to form High Peak Buses.  \nDuring September 2022, it was announced that current managing director Jeff Counsell will retire in February 2023 and will be succeeded by Tom Morgan who is the current commercial director for Wellglade Group.\n\n## Active Subsidiaries and Interests  \n### Trent Barton  \nTrent Barton operates services from Bakewell in the north to Coalville in the south as well as Ashbourne, Burton upon Trent, Chesterfield, Derby, Ilkeston, Mansfield, and Nottingham. It was formed when the Trent Buses and Barton Transport operations were merged.  \n### First Leicester  \nThrough their Trent Barton operations, Wellglade Group acquired a 6% shareholding of First Leicester in 1993, First Bus UK are the majority shareholder in the operations.  \n### Kinchbus  \nKinchbus is a bus operator based in Loughborough. It was originally an independent company established by Gilbert and Janet Kinch.  \nKinchbus operate some local services around Loughborough along with their Kinchbus2 route between Barrow-upon-Soar and Loughborough, Skylink from Leicester to Derby via Loughborough and East Midlands Airport.  \nKinchbus use the slogan 'Loughborough's Finest' which is advertised across their fleet of buses. Following the collapse of Nottingham based Premiere Travel on 24 January 2013, Kinchbus reinstated their service 9 between Loughborough and Nottingham which was the first route to have the new refreshed version of the current livery and logo which have been in place since 2007.  \n### Notts and Derby  \nNotts + Derby operates a small number of local bus services, school buses and contract and private hire work in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. They operate a fleet of vehicles, most of which previously operated with Trentbarton and Nottingham City Transport.  \n### TM Travel  \nTM Travel is a bus operator based in Halfway, Sheffield, operating bus services in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire. It was founded in 1995 as a family-owned operation with one bus.  School bus services and National Express services were later introduced.  The company moved into scheduled bus service operation in 1999, winning a contract from Derbyshire County Council.  A local route in Bolsover was launched a year later.  In 2004 TM Travel took over a route between Sheffield and Chesterfield previously run by Thompson Travel.  A number of South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive contracts were won over the following few years and the fleet increased in size to over 100 vehicles, prompting a move from Chesterfield to Halfway.  As of March 2008, TM Travel was the largest independent coach and bus operator in Derbyshire, employing 120 staff, with all operations (including maintaining the fleet of vehicles) handled in-house.  As of September 2017, the TM fleet consists of 66 buses.  The company was acquired by WG in January 2010.  \n### Nottingham Express Transit  \nIn March 2011 the Tramlink Nottingham consortium which Wellglade holds a 12.5% shareholding in, was awarded the Nottingham Express Transit 2 contract by Nottingham City Council. In December 2011 Tramlink Nottingham took over the running of the tram network.  \n### High Peak Buses  \nIn April 2012 Centrebus and Trent Barton entered a 50/50 joint venture. This saw Centrebus owned Bowers Coaches and Trent Barton's Buxton area services combined to form High Peak Buses based at the latter's Dove Holes depot.  \n### Kleanline  \nWellglade also owns cleaning service provider Kleanline.  \n## Inactive Subsidiaries and Interests  \n### Midland General  \nThe Midland General Omnibus Company was incorporated in 1920 as a company in the Balfour Beatty group with a depot at Langley Mill. In 1972 the company's operations were merged with those of Trent and the Midland General fleetname ceased to be used.  \nThe name was resurrected when Bargain Bus routes BB2 to Cotgrave and BB4 to Long Eaton were started in Nottingham in competition with Premiere Travel's services. These were withdrawn after Premiere Travel decided to withdraw their services.  \nThe Black Cat and Ilkeston Flyer services acquired from Felix in January 2012 were to be operated by Midland General. In practice buses of the Notts + Derby fleet operated both services and the Midland General name has disappeared from the timetables.  \n### Felix Bus Services  \nIn January 2012 Wellglade purchased some assets from Felix Bus Services. Felix already shared two routes with Trent Barton, these being Black Cat and Ilkeston Flyer. Despite the appearance of the Midland General name in timetables, the former Felix journeys were operated by Notts + Derby.\n\nQuestion: Which image shows a vehicle that is NOT part of the Wellglade Group's fleet as per the description provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Analyze the given context and associated images, draw inferences from the combination of both, and provide responses to posed questions.\nContext:\n# African Wildlife Foundation  \nThe African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) is the leading international conservation organization focused exclusively on Africa's wildlife and wild lands.About AWF  \nAWF's programs and conservation strategies are designed to protect the wildlife and wild lands of Africa and ensure a more sustainable future for Africa's people. AWF protects Africa's wildlife, its wild lands, and its natural resources.  \nSince its inception in 1961, the organization has protected endangered species and land, promoted conservation enterprises that benefit local African communities, and trained hundreds of African nationals in conservation.  \n## Early years  \nRussell Train, founder of the AWF  \nThe African Wildlife Leadership Foundation (AWLF) was founded in 1961 by Russell E. Train, a wealthy judge and hunter, and member of the Washington Safari Club. Other founding members from the Safari Club were Nick Arundel, a former United States Marine Corps combat officer and journalist; Kermit Roosevelt Jr. of the CIA; James S. Bugg, a businessman; and Maurice Stans, later to become Richard Nixon's finance chairman.Virginia Assembly...2009  \nTrain was worried that European park managers would be replaced by unqualified Africans in conservation work as African countries gained their independence. Twenty African countries became independent in 1960 and 1961.  \nTrain wrote \"In Tanganyika alone, the government recently ordered 100 percent Africanization of the game service by 1966!... Replacement of European staff by untrained, unqualified men spells disaster for the game\".  \nHe felt that it was urgent to train Africans to become wildlife professionals.  \nThe first major grant of the AWLF was $47,000 to help found the College of African Wildlife Management at Mweka, Tanzania in 1963.  \nThe college was organized by Bruce Kinloch, Chief Game Warden of Tanganyika, as a pioneer institution for the training of African wildlife managers.Eyeball to eyeball...  \nFunding for Mweka was also provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Frankfurt Zoological Society, with facilities donated by the government of Tanganyika.  \nBy 2010, the college had trained over 4,500 wildlife managers from 28 African countries and 18 non-African countries.Last Stand...  \nIn 1963, AWLF started a scholarship program to bring young Africans to American universities where they could study biology and wildlife management. The AWLF built a conservation education center in the same year, situated at the entrance to the Nairobi National Park. In 1967, the AWLF provided $50,000 to finance construction of a Research Institute in Tanzania. In 1970, the AWF established a school for wildlife management in Garoua, Cameroon, giving instruction in French.  \nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the AWLF continued to finance students, and also assisted conservation projects, often giving supplies such as tents, vehicle spare parts, water pumps, and photographic equipment rather than cash.Conserving Wildlife - 14 years  \nIn 1969, the AWLF took the lead in a campaign supported by other conservation groups to protect rhinoceroses. In 1974, the foundation began a program to study cheetahs.Conserving Wildlife - 14 years  \nIn 1983, the AWF dropped \"Leadership\" from its name. Train was disappointed with the change, believing that the organization had lost sight of its original mandate. In his view, it had become just another conservation organization, giving funding to westerners to conduct research on animals.  \nHowever, research such as Dian Fossey's work on gorillas and Cynthia Moss's work on elephants, both supported by the AWF, was clearly useful.  \nThe foundation struggled to raise money.  \nIn 1968, the annual budget was less than US$250,000.Conserving Wildlife - 14 years  \nIn 1988, the year in which the AWF launched a campaign against elephant poaching, the foundation had a staff of six and an annual budget of just $2 million.  \nWhen the AWF turned 30 in 1991, the board of trustees continued to be dominated by prominent and wealthy Americans, many of whom served on other non-profit boards.  \n## Recent thrusts  \nIn more recent years, the AWF has modeled its program around three objectives: empowering people, conserving wildlife, and protecting land. Empowering people involves conservation enterprises that provide benefits and incentives to local communities, sponsoring training of African conservationists and working with government to define conservation policy.Empowering People  \nConserving wildlife involves research into species and how these species interact with people, the basis for creating programs from which both humans and animals can benefit.Conserving Wildlife  \nThe main thrust, however, is on protecting land, ensuring that large open landscapes are available for wildlife.  \nThis involves supporting existing protected areas, creating private land trusts and working with local community groups on protecting special sites. Starting in 1998, land protection efforts focused on landscape-level conservation approaches. Protecting Land  \nThe foundation had income of US$19,333,998 in the fiscal year ended 30 June 2009. Of this, $8,582,555 came from public sector support, $5,815,839 from corporate and foundation support, $5,224,931 from gifts from individuals and $1,360,424 from legacy gifts.  \n$17,395,456 was spent on programs, $1,524,764 on fund raising, and $1,262,056 in administration.  \nProgram funding broke down as $14,174,224 on conservation programs, $2,392,989 on public education and $828,243 on membership programs.BBB Wise Giving...  \n## Priority landscapes  \nAWF used to call the landscapes that it supports \"heartlands\"; now, the organization employs a \"priority landscape\" approach.  \nHeartlands include:The African Landscape  \n## Priority Landscapes  \nPriority Landscapes include:  \n### Bili Uele  \nThe Bili-Uele Protected Area Complex is found in the remote north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, along the border of the Central African Republic. The region consists of savanna mosaic north of the Uele River and lowland primary forest to the south. Both regions support exceptional biodiversity, including forest elephants, lions, as well as the last remaining undisturbed population of the eastern chimpanzee. An estimated 35,000–65,000 eastern chimpanzees are found in this complex. However, very little is known about the Bili-Uele area, and few organizations are working there.  \n### Congo  \n<image>Group of bonobos\nThe Maringa-Lopori-Wamba Landscape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo one of the least developed and most remote parts of the Congo Basin.  \nThe inhabitants are among the poorest in Africa, depending on natural resources to meet their basic needs.  \nMost of the people live by slash-and-burn agriculture, and rely on bushmeat such as porcupine, sitatunga, and forest hog for protein.  \nCash crops include maize, cassave and groundnuts.  \nThe growing population is placing more stress on the environment, and there is risk of a revival of logging that could harm the ability of the land to sustain the people and could jeopardize both biodiversity.  \nSince 1973 a Japanese team has been researching the bonobo population near the village of Wamba in 1973.  \nHowever, research was discontinued after political disorders started in 1991 followed by civil war in 1997, resuming only in the mid-2000s.  \nThe IUCN Red List classifies bonobos as an endangered species with conservative population estimates ranging from 29,500 to 50,000 individuals.Pan paniscus: IUCN  \nThe AWF has led efforts by local and international groups to develop a sustainable land use plan for the MLW Landscape.  \nThe plan aims to ensure that the economic and cultural needs of the inhabitants are met while conserving the environment.  \nThe approach combines AWF's Landscape Conservation Process and the Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) Program Monitoring Plan.  \nA variety of tools are used including surveys, interviews with local people and satellite image interpretation.Dupain et al. 2008\n\n### Etosha-Skeleton Coast  \nThe Etosha-Skeleton Coast landscape, in the northern part of Namibia, is home to Etosha National Park and its vast salt pan, woodland, and savanna ecosystems. The landscape is home to a diverse range of wildlife, from the black-faced impala to the desert-dwelling oryx to more commonly known animals such as the elephant, wild dog, lion, and cheetah. Possibly, most importantly, to the west of the park lies the Skeleton Coast, where herds of elephants roam. African Wildlife Foundation is scaling up social venture capital investments through its subsidiary, African Wildlife Capital (AWC), which invests in socially and environmentally responsible businesses, such as the Grootberg Lodge in the Khoadi-Hoas community conservancy. These businesses must comply with conservation covenants, ensuring that they are sustainable and improving livelihoods for people and habitats for wildlife.  \n### Faro  \nAt the core of the Faro landscape in northern Cameroon is Faro National Park, located close to the Nigerian border. Not only does this park host the largest population of hippos in Cameroon, it is also home to elephants, black rhinos, cheetahs, hyenas, and other wildlife. AWF is lending support to counter-poaching park rangers in Faro and building a contingent of community scouts on the park's borders to provide a needed buffer between outsiders and the park.  \n### Great Fish River  \nThe Great Fish River Nature Reserve is located in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. The 45,000-hectare reserve, which lies in the Great Fish River valley, is home to an important and increasingly vulnerable population of critically endangered black rhino.  \n### Kazungula  \nAerial photo of Kazungula (centre right) on the Zambezi River  \nThe two white rhinos at Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in May 2005  \nThe floodplains of the Zambezi River are surrounded by a mosaic of miombo and mopane woodlands and grasslands that include important wildlife migration corridors.Kazungula Landscape  \nThe Victoria Falls, the largest in the world, are between Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in Zambia and Victoria Falls National Park in Zimbabwe.  \nThe Falls and surrounding area are designated a World Heritage Site.  \nHowever, the environment is threatened by growing and haphazard development of tourism, and lack of funding to the park authorities.Mosi-Oa-Tunya  \nThe AWF has established the ha Sekute Conservation Area in this region in partnership with the Sekute Chiefdom, holding two elephant corridors.Kazungula Landscape  \nAWF helped wildlife authorities settle four new white rhinos in Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in Zambia, joining the last surviving white rhino in the country, a bull.  \nOn 17 January 2011 it was reported that two of the female white rhinos had given birth to calves, which seemed healthy.Exciting News...  \nThe area is also home to endangered black rhinos.Kazungula Landscape  \nIn 2011 a cluster of modern new buildings for the Lupani community school were opened in Kazungula, built by the AWF at a cost of US$250,000.  \nThe new school has six classrooms, offices and five teachers' houses with three bedrooms each.2011  \n### Kilimanjaro  \n<image>Elephants grazing in Amboseli swamps, north of Kilimanjaro\nDisney released the movie African Cats in April 2011. The Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund gave AWF a portion of the proceeds from the first week's ticket sales for use in protecting the Amboseli Wildlife Corridor. Their \"See 'African Cats,' Save the Savanna\" program served both to promote the movie and to raise money for conservation.Disney's African Cats\n\n### Limpopo  \n<image>Buffalo Bend on the Mwenezi River, Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe\nThe Limpopo Landscape includes areas of Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.  \nIt includes savanna, woodland, rivers and floodplains.  \nFauna include sable antelope, rhinos, hippos, and many species of birds, insects and aquatic life.Limpopo Landscape  \nThe AWF has started the Leopard Conservation Science Project in this landscape.Revealing the Leopard  \nThe AWF is particularly involved in the Banhine National Park in Mozambique, which covers sqmi.  \nUntil recently this park had little or no infrastructure or staff to ensure that the environment was protected.  \nThe AWF has built a conservation research center, which it is marketing to the international scientific community.  \nFees from researchers will pay for staff to run the center and to manage the park.Strengthening Banhine  \nThe Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP) is a sqmi park that is being established to connect the Kruger National Park in South Africa, the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique, the Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe and other protected areas.  \nIt is almost the size of the Netherlands and more than three times larger than the Yellowstone National Park.  \nThe GLTP is home to many of the species most popular with tourists, including lion, white and black rhinoceros, giraffe, elephant, hippopotamus and buffalo.  \nThe AWF says the megapark will result in \"creating new jobs and fortifying a tourism base not yet meeting its full potential\".Great Limpopo Transfrontier  \nThe AWF is a major sponsor of the project that is setting up this park.Seven Elephants...\n\n### Maasai Steppe  \nTarangire National Park in Tanzania, East Africa  \nThe ha Manyara Ranch Conservancy is near to Lake Manyara in Tanzania.  \nThis is a pioneering conservation and tourism project supported by the African Wildlife Foundation, the Tanzania Land Conservation Trust and the Manyara Ranch Conservancy. While not a park, the conservancy is frequented by resident and migrating wildlife including elephant, lion, buffalo, leopard and the more common plains game. Rarely seen in the parks but a common resident on the Conservancy is the lesser kudu.Making Conservation Our Business  \n### Mau Forest Complex  \nWithin Kenya's Rift Valley, sits the Mau Forest Complex. It is the largest indigenous montane forest in East Africa and serves as a critical water catchment area for the country, providing a source of water for many of Kenya's wildlife and people. African Wildlife Foundation, together with the Kenya Forest Service, the Community Forest Association, and other stakeholders, is reforesting areas of the Mau Forest with indigenous trees.  \n### Parc W  \n<image>West African giraffes near Kouré, Niger\nThis sqmi region is located around the point where Niger, Burkina Faso and Benin meet.  \nIt consists of three national protected parks that form a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the trans-national W National Park, as well as several adjacent reserves and buffer zones.  \nThe complex includes savanna woodlands, gallery forests and flooded plains where the Mekrou and Niver rivers meet.  \nIt is home to large and diverse wildlife populations including the largest population of elephants in the region and the only remaining West African giraffes.Parc W Landscape  \nMitochondrial and nuclear DNA research shows that this is a distinct and genetically healthy subspecies that diverged from the Rothschild's giraffe about 350,000 years ago.World's rarest giraffe  \nIn Parc W, AWF and other International NGOs such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature, World Wide Fund for Nature and Africa 70 play a central role in communication, education and organization of local communities and their leaders, and help collect socio-economic and technical data.Strategie Nationale  \nAWF is helping fund tree nurseries in Niger and Burkino Faso for replantings to provide fodder for the giraffes.Parc W Landscape Conservation threats are human population growth and desertification. AWF partners in the region include the Association pour la Sauvegarde des Girafes du Niger, Centre National de Gestion des Réserves de Faune (CENAGREF), Benin and the Ministries of the Environment in Burkina Faso and Niger.Parc W Landscape\n\n### Ruaha  \nThe Ruaha area will intersect with an agriculture corridor that the Tanzanian government wants to develop in southern Tanzania. The proposed corridor will overlap many different ecosystems, possibly undermining their ecological integrity and impacting wildlife areas. AWF is scaling up social venture capital investments through its subsidiary, African Wildlife Capital (AWC), which invests in socially and environmentally responsible agricultural and other businesses—such as the Rungwe Avocado Co.—that must comply with conservation covenants to secure and maintain investment. These AWC-invested businesses not only aim to benefit wildlife, but also benefit small-farm holders.  \n### Samburu  \n<image>Grevy's zebras in Samburu National Reserve\nThe national parks, private ranches, and communal lands of the Samburu Landscape support some of Africa's most impressive wildlife. The Grevy's zebra and reticulated giraffe, species that are found only north of the Equator in Africa, roam in the Samburu Landscape among the acacia grasslands. The unique conservation challenges faced in Samburu are forest/habitat degradation due to logging and farming and cattle-carnivore conflict.  \nAWF has implemented solutions to address these challenges, including partnering with Starbucks Coffee Trading Co. to train coffee growers in sustainable and more productive practices, providing wildlife scouts with monitoring technology, and working with Samburu warriors to protect endangered predators.\n\n### Virunga  \n<image>Mountain gorillas in Virunga National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo\nThe Virunga landscape is an area of volcanic highlands around the point where Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo meet, Virunga is home to the last 700 mountain gorillas in the world.  \nIt includes the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda, where AWF opened a visitor center in July 2006.  \nThe Virunga ecosystem is highly diverse, and also shelters chimpanzees, golden monkeys, forest elephants, and many species of birds, reptiles and amphibians.  \nThe region is overpopulated, intensely poor and politically unstable, placing severe threats on the environment.Virunga Landscape  \nThe AWF helped Dian Fossey study Rwandan mountain gorillas in the 1960s.  \nAWF President Robinson McIlvaine later said that \"There would be no mountain gorillas in the Virungas today... were it not for Dian Fossey's tireless efforts over many years\".Celebrating AWF's 40th  \nMcIlvaine initiated formation of a consortium to protect the threatened Rwandan mountain gorillas while he was president of the AWF between 1978 and 1982.Robinson McIlvaine  \nMore recently, the AWF coordinated fundraising and construction of a lodge overlooking the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, home of about half the world's population of mountain gorillas.Clouds Mountain Gorilla Lodge  \nAccording to Farley Mowat in his book Woman in the Mists, in the late 1970s Fossey asked McIlvaine to temporarily serve as secretary-treasurer of the Digit Fund while he was AWF President.  \nShe had created the fund to finance patrols against poachers seeking to kill mountain gorillas. McIlvaine partnered with the International Primate Protection League, the Digit Fund, and his own AWF asking for funds, to be made out to the AWF.  \nThe Digit Fund received none of the money. When McIlvaine suggested to Fossey that the Digit Fund could be folded into AWF, Fossey declined and McIlvaine resigned as secretary-treasurer of the fund.  \nThe AWF is a co-sponsor of the International Gorilla Conservation Program (IGCP) in Virunga, the others being Fauna & Flora International (FFI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Among other activities, the IGCP works with Virunga Artisans, which markets handmade products of artisans who live near the Volcanoes, Mgahinga and Bwindi National Parks.About Virunga Artisans  \nA census of mountain gorillas in the Virunga Massif in March and April 2010 showed that there had been a 26.3% increase in the population over the past seven years, an encouraging sign that conservation efforts were succeeding.2010\n\n### Save Valley  \nThe Save Valley landscape was once dominated by a large livestock operation that pushed out native wildlife and degraded much of the ecosystem. During recent decades, cattle fences and livestock have been removed, and the landscape has seen a resurgence of wildlife and a recovery of the wild habitats.  \nThe Save Valley Conservancy, in Zimbabwe's southern lowveld area, forms part of the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park. Lions, buffalo, leopard, elephant, and other game, including black and white rhinos, live in this area. AWF supports Save Valley Conservancy's anti-poaching efforts and works with government partners to ensure the protection of Save's wildlife, namely its rhino populations.  \n## Organization  \nThe African Wildlife Foundation headquarters are in Nairobi, Kenya with offices in South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Washington, DC.  \nThe organization is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  \nAs of 2009 there were 36 members of the Board and 132 paid staff.  \nFunds are raised through direct mail, grant proposals, Internet appeals, planned giving, cause-related marketing, and membership appeals.BBB Wise Giving...  \nThe executive heads of the foundation have been:AWF's History  \nThe AWF is a member of International Conservation Caucus Foundation's Conservation Council.Conservation Council It is also a member of EarthShare, a national federation that supports leading American environmental and conservation charities.Who We Support  \n## Citations  \n## General and cited references  \n* fix-attempted=yes\n\nQuestion: Which of the following African wildlife conservation areas is known for being the last refuge for the endangered mountain gorillas?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Microsoft Lumia  \nMicrosoft Lumia (previously the Nokia Lumia) is a discontinued line of mobile devices that was originally designed and marketed by Nokia and later by Microsoft Mobile. Introduced in November 2011, the line was the result of a long-term partnership between Nokia and Microsoft—as such, Lumia smartphones run on Microsoft software, the Windows Phone operating system; and later the newer Windows 10 Mobile. The Lumia name is derived from the partitive plural form of the Finnish word lumi, meaning \"snow\".  \nOn 3 September 2013, Microsoft announced its purchase of Nokia's mobile device business, with the deal closing on 25 April 2014. As a result, the Lumia line's maintenance was transferred to Microsoft Mobile. As part of the transition, Microsoft continued to use the Nokia brand on Lumia devices until October 2014, when it began to officially phase out the Nokia name in its promotion and production of smartphones in favor of Microsoft branding. In November 2014, Microsoft announced the first Microsoft (non-Nokia) branded Lumia device, the Lumia 535. In October 2015, Microsoft announced the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile, the Lumia 950, Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550. The most recent Lumia smartphone, the Lumia 650, was announced by Microsoft on 15 February 2016.  \nSales decreased sharply after the introduction of Windows 10 in 2015 and Microsoft briefly stopped selling Lumia devices from the Microsoft Store at the end of 2016—by which time sales were estimated to have dropped below one million units—although availability was restored at the beginning of 2017. In October 2017, Microsoft's corporate vice president, Joe Belfiore, confirmed that Microsoft would no longer sell or manufacture new Windows 10 Mobile devices. The existing devices would receive bug fixes and security updates only, ending for the latest devices in December 2019.  \n## History  \nFrom 1998 to 2012, Nokia was the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world, which included early smartphones built on its Symbian platform. However, in recent years, its market share declined as a result of the growing use of touchscreen smartphones from other vendors, such as Apple's iPhone line and Android-based products. In 2010, its market share had declined to 28%, and in April 2012, Samsung Electronics (a prominent user of Android) ultimately overtook Nokia as the largest mobile phone vendor in the world. Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop vetoed the idea of producing Android devices, believing the company wouldn't be able to suitably differentiate its Android products from that of other vendors. In an employee memo, Elop infamously described the company as being on a \"burning platform\", blaming the \"war of ecosystems\" between iOS and Android as part of Nokia's overall struggle, and asserting that the company needed to make major changes to its operation.  \n### Partnership between Microsoft and Nokia  \nThe Nokia Lumia logo, used prior to the post-acquisition rebranding by Microsoft  \n<image>Nokia Lumia 800, the first Lumia device\nIn February 2011, Stephen Elop and Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer jointly announced a major business partnership between Nokia and Microsoft, which would see Nokia adopt Windows Phone as its primary platform on future smartphones, replacing both Symbian and MeeGo. The deal also included the integration of Bing as the search engine on Nokia devices, and the integration of Nokia Maps into Microsoft's own mapping services. Nokia had planned to use the MeeGo platform as part of its future plans prior to the announcement, although the company announced that it would still release one MeeGo device in 2011. Aligning with Microsoft had been considered a possibility by analysts due to Elop's prior employment with the company.  \nNokia unveiled its first Windows Phone 7-based devices, the mid-range Lumia 710 and high-end Lumia 800, on 26 October 2011 at its Nokia World conference. Motivated by requests from the U.S. carrier AT&T for an LTE-enabled device, Nokia quickly developed the Lumia 900 as a follow-up, first unveiled at the 2012 International CES. The Lumia 900 received heavy promotion by the carrier as a flagship device, but its launch was dampened by a software bug that prevented the device from connecting to certain mobile data networks, forcing AT&T to issue credits to those who purchased the device. Upon its launch in April 2012, the Lumia 900 was listed as a top seller on Amazon.com, but online sales began to taper off by May. While not revealing further details, a Nokia representative stated that the company was \"pleased with the consumer reaction, as well as the support we have received from AT&T\", while AT&T's mobility chief Ralph de la Vega stated that the Lumia 900 had \"exceeded expectations\".  \nIn early 2012, Nokia released the Lumia 610, a new entry-level device taking advantage of the lower system requirements introduced by Windows Phone 7's \"Tango\" update. These new low-end devices were intended to improve Windows Phone adoption in emerging markets such as China. In June 2012, both Nokia and Microsoft received much criticism after it was revealed that the Windows Phone 7 Lumia devices will not be upgradable to Microsoft's second generation Windows Phone platform, Windows Phone 8. It has been said that those devices won't be upgraded because Windows Phone 8 uses an entirely different kernel (Windows NT). The original Lumia range instead received a different update called Windows Phone 7.8.  \nLater in September 2012, Nokia unveiled the Lumia 820 and the Lumia 920, its first two devices to use Windows Phone 8. Both featured NFC, with the Lumia 820 embedding a microSD card slot, and an optional Wireless Charging Shell for Qi wireless charging. The Lumia 920 also notably featured Qi wireless charging, and a \"PureView\" camera with optical image stabilization. While Nokia received criticism when it was revealed that a demonstration video of its image stabilization technology was, in fact, filmed using a professional camera, the Lumia 920 was a commercial success for the company.  \nA Nokia Lumia 520  \nAt MWC 2013, Nokia introduced two more Windows Phone 8 devices: the mid-range Nokia Lumia 720 and the budget Nokia Lumia 520, the latter of which has become the highest selling Windows phone device ever. In 2013, Nokia also introduced the Lumia 925, a revised version of the 920 with a slimmer build incorporating aluminium, and the Lumia 1020, which features a 41-megapixel camera based on technology from its Symbian-based 808 PureView. On 22 October 2013, Nokia extended the Lumia brand into the tablet market with the unveiling of the Lumia 2520; running Microsoft's Windows RT operating system, it was the company's first tablet since the Nokia Internet tablet range. Some critics believed that the usage of Windows RT rather than full Microsoft Windows 8.1 led to bad sales, as most major Windows tablet makers have used Windows 8.1 in favour of Windows RT. Alternatively, others have claimed that the device's failure was due to its heavy weight and high price. Lumia 2520 was discontinued in early 2015.  \nAlthough sales of the Lumia line had exceeded those of BlackBerry in the same period, Nokia still made an operating loss of €115m, with revenues falling 24% to €5.7bn following the second quarter of 2013. Over the past nine quarters,date=May 2017 Nokia sustained €4.1 billion worth of operating losses. In Q3 2013, Lumia sales hit 8.8 million worldwide; over three times higher than the same period the year before; and double the figure in North America compared to the previous quarter. At the same time, overall Windows Phone market share hit double figures in several countries in Europe and other regions.\n\n### Acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business  \nNokia Lumia 1020 with 41 MP rear camera  \nOn 3 September 2013, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Nokia's mobile phone business (including rights to the Lumia and low-end Asha brands) in an overall deal of over US$7bn. Stephen Elop stepped down as Nokia's CEO and returned to Microsoft as its head of devices as part of the deal, which closed in early 2014. While Microsoft will license the Nokia name under a 10-year agreement, the company will only be able to use it on feature phones: those running the Series 30, Series 30+ and the Series 40 mobile operating systems based on Java ME and MediaTek technology, respectively. These changes resulted in future Lumia models being first-party hardware produced by Microsoft.  \nCodenames for Lumia phones developed from late 2013 were based on James Bond movies, including \"Moneypenny\" (which became Nokia Lumia 630) and \"Goldfinger\" (which would be the cancelled Lumia \"McLaren\").  \n#### Android prototypes  \nOn 13 September 2013, the New York Times writer Nick Wingfield revealed that Nokia had been testing the Android operating system on its Lumia hardware. It was one of two known Android projects at the company; the other was running the OS on low–end Asha hardware, which resulted in the Nokia X family of devices. Despite the testing, the Android-based Lumia handsets were never released and only altered Asha devices were brought to the market.  \nIn July 2014, Microsoft announced that it would discontinue the majority of its Nokia-branded devices, including the Asha, S30, S40, and X platforms, in favor of low-cost Lumia devices inheriting their design. This left S30+ as Microsoft's only remaining Nokia-branded phone platform until it was sold to HMD Global in May 2016, who, the following February, would announce the first Nokia-branded true Android phone, the Nokia 6, in January 2017.  \n### Under Microsoft ownership  \n<image>Microsoft Lumia 535, the first Microsoft branded Lumia device\nEven after the acquisition of Nokia's mobile device business by Microsoft, several Lumia devices were unveiled by Microsoft Mobile in September 2014 that still carried the Nokia name, including the Lumia 830 and Lumia 735. In July 2014, it had been reported by evleaks that Microsoft was attempting to license the Nokia name in a co-branding scheme, which would have possibly seen future devices branded as \"Nokia by Microsoft\". As a part of the change of ownership, the social network pages have also been rebranded as Microsoft Lumia rather than Microsoft Mobile; this sought to emphasize the Windows Phone over other Nokia mobile phones while also updating social network pages of Windows Phone to the new Microsoft Lumia branding. To reflect this change, Nokia Conversations was also rebranded as Lumia Conversations, and NokNok.tv to Lumia Conversations UK. However, the rebranding has not been consistent, as the Nokia Army was renamed the Spartan Nation and the support site for legacy phones, accessories, various Nokia-branded devices, and services, originally Nokia Discussions, was renamed the Microsoft Mobile Community. The Lumia Beamer was the last Lumia-branded application to have its URL changed from Nokia to Lumia, signifying the end of the transitional term during which Microsoft was allowed to use Nokia.com and related sites.  \nHowever, in October 2014, Microsoft officially announced that it would phase out the Nokia brand in its promotion and production of Lumia smartphones, and that future Lumia models would be branded solely with the name and logo of Microsoft. In November 2014, Microsoft announced its first self-branded phone, Microsoft Lumia 535. Rebranding the Lumia line did not affect sales, though some critics believed that it might negatively influence consumers' decisions due to Nokia's established reputation for durability compared to the relative infancy of Microsoft's brand in the consumer phone space. The Nokia Lumia 638 was the last Lumia product to bear the Nokia brand, and was only released in India in December 2014.  \nIn November 2014, a post by a Microsoft Twitter account stated that all Nokia and Microsoft Lumia smartphones running Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 would receive updates to Windows 10; however, following the official unveiling, Microsoft denied this, stating that they instead were targeting the \"majority\" of Lumia phones and that not all phones would receive the update or support all of its features. Later, Microsoft confirmed that low-end devices with 512 MB of RAM (including the Nokia Lumia 520, which represents 24.5% of all Windows Phone devices sold), would also get the Windows 10 upgrade, but reaffirmed that not all of its features would be supported on these devices. Additionally, Microsoft stated on January 16, 2015, that low-end Windows Phone 8.1 phones will not get some Lumia Denim features.  \nIn July 2015, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft had a planned restructuring of Microsoft Mobile, which includes the Microsoft Lumia range. This would reportedly include a write down of approximately US$7.6 billion on the acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business and a layoff of around 7,200 employees. It was also reported that Microsoft would release fewer first-party devices each year. As part of a larger restructuring, the Microsoft Devices & Studios engineering group was merged with the Operating Systems Engineering Group to form the larger Windows & Devices Engineering Group. In July 2015, it was announced that the head of Surface, Panos Panay, would head the new Microsoft devices unit, which would include the Microsoft Lumia as well as various other Microsoft hardware products such as the Band, HoloLens, and Xbox.  \nIn October 2015, Microsoft launched the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile: the Lumia 950, Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550. In February 2016, the Lumia 650, which also runs Windows 10 Mobile, was launched. Sales of Lumia devices declined between fiscal years 2015 and 2016, with phone revenue decreasing by $4.2 billion or 56%. When Microsoft announced the acquisition in September 2013, 7.3 million devices were sold in the quarter, but this shrunk to 1.2 million at the quarter ending June 2016. Since the Lumia series make up 95% of total Windows Phone/Windows 10 Mobile sales, the operating system market share also shrunk along with it. Throughout 2016 Microsoft slowed down production volumes of Lumia devices, and it was speculated that the series would be discontinued by the end of 2016.  \nShortly after the discontinuation of the Elite X3, HP's attempt to bring Windows 10 Mobile to a niche market, Microsoft's corporate vice president Joe Belfiore confirmed that Microsoft would no longer sell or manufacture new mobile devices. The existing devices would receive bug fixes and security updates only.\n\n## Lumia updates  \nNokia and Microsoft Mobile have released several updates unique to Lumia devices which feature a combination of firmware and software updates. The latter of these includes imaging improvements, new technology support, feature updates, and bug fixes. Because Lumia devices exclusively use Windows Phone, major operating system updates are often bundled with the firmware updates upon release.  \nSimilar to how Windows Phones receive operating system updates, Lumia update releases are dependent on carriers who decide if and when devices are to receive them. However, operating system updates are not subject to these constraints if users are part of Microsoft's Windows Insider or Preview for Developers programs.  \n## List of Lumia devices  \nAll devices in the Lumia line were smartphones (including one tablet computer) running Microsoft Windows software. All the smartphones were full-touch in a candybar form. There were no QWERTY devices, although there were reports in 2012 that Nokia was working on such device similar to the Nokia Eseries. An alleged prototype device with full keyboard was leaked in 2017.  \n### Numbering convention  \nThe first digit (or the first two digits for devices with four-digit model numbers) indicates the device's family, with larger numbers generally denoting a higher-end device. Under Nokia, numbers larger than 10 indicated a phablet (e.g. 1320, 1520) or tablet (2520). Following the sale of the Lumia line to Microsoft, four-digit model numbers were discontinued, with larger models instead being denoted by an \"XL\" suffix (e.g. 950 XL).  \nThe second digit indicates the generation of the device, based on the operating system it originally shipped with:  \nThe third digit is used to distinguish between variants in the same family and generation. 0 indicates the base model, while other numbers indicate either a minor upgrade (e.g. 920 and 925), a 4G-capable variant (e.g. 730 and 735) or a regional or carrier-specific variant.  \nAn optional \"C\" or \"T\" suffix indicates a variant produced exclusively for the Chinese market.  \n### Nokia-branded Lumia devices  \n### Microsoft-branded Lumia devices  \n## Comparison of Lumia smartphones  \n## Sales  \nGraph of quarterly global sales (million units)  \nImageSize  = width:auto height:250 barincrement:60  \nPlotArea   = left:50 bottom:15 top:10 right:18  \nAlignBars  = justify  \nPeriod     = from:0 till:11  \nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical  \nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:0  \nPlotData=  \ncolor:skyblue width:47 align:center  \nbar:Q4.2011 from:start till:1 text:1  \nbar:Q1.2012 from:start till:2 text:2  \nbar:Q2.2012 from:start till:4 text:4  \nbar:Q3.2012 from:start till:2.9 text:2.9  \nbar:Q4.2012 from:start till:4.4 text:4.4  \nbar:Q1.2013 from:start till:5.6 text:5.6  \nbar:Q2.2013 from:start till:7.4 text:7.4  \nbar:Q3.2013 from:start till:8.8 text:8.8  \nbar:Q4.2013 from:start till:8.2 text:8.2  \nbar:Q1.2014 from:start till:8 text:8  \nbar:Q2.2014 from:start till:7.4 text:7.4  \nbar:Q3.2014 from:start till:9.3 text:9.3  \nbar:Q4.2014 from:start till:10.5 text:10.5  \nbar:Q1.2015 from:start till:8.6 text:8.6  \nbar:Q2.2015 from:start till:8.4 text:8.4  \nbar:Q3.2015 from:start till:5.8 text:5.8  \nbar:Q4.2015 from:start till:4.5 text:4.5  \nbar:Q1.2016 from:start till:2.3 text:2.3  \nbar:Q2.2016 from:start till:1.2 text:1.2  \nbar:Q3.2016 from:start till:1 text:1\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the devices shown in the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Regional Committee of Communists in Macedonia  \nThe Regional Committee of Communists in Macedonia was the provincial communist organization in Vardar Macedonia from 1939 to 1943.  \n## History  \n<image>Shatorov was the leader of Macedonian communists in 1941. He was killed under unknown circumstances in September 1944. There are indications he was eliminated by Tito's order as a politically inconvenient leader.\nAt the beginning of 1939, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia decided that Vardar Macedonia should form a regional committee. Svetozar Vukmanović was sent to Skopje in August of that year, and the local committee was organised under his leadership on 8 September. Blagoje Orlandić, another Serb, was chosen as secretary.  \nAfter organising a large demonstration in Skopje in December, Orlandić was arrested and sentenced to one year in prison. In February 1940, a new regional-committee leadership was elected at a meeting; Metodi Shatorov was elected secretary. In June, a national regional-committee program was drawn up. A September 8, 1940 conference was held near Skopje, at which a political resolution was drafted and new leadership was elected. Under Shatorov's leadership, the Macedonian regional committee followed Communist International (Comintern) policy and maintained close ties with Georgi Dimitrov.  \nAfter the Bulgarian  takeover of Vardarska Banovina in April 1941, the Macedonian communists fell into the Communist Party of Bulgaria's sphere of influence under Sharlo's leadership. When the directive to organise an armed resistance movement in all regions of occupied Yugoslavia was issued, Sharlo disobeyed the order. He told the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) that the situation in Macedonia did not permit immediate military action; propaganda should precede the formation of military units. Sharlo refused to define the Bulgarian forces as occupiers (contrary to instructions from Belgrade), however, and called for the incorporation of the local Macedonian Communist organisations into the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP). The Macedonian regional committee refused to remain in contact with the CPY, and joined the BCP. Sharlo refused to distribute a CPY proclamation calling for military action against Bulgarians.  \nBecause of the conflict within the Macedonian CPY regional committee, there was no resistance movement in Vardar Macedonia. The Comintern supported a policy of non-intervention at the beginning of World War II, arguing that the war was an imperialist conflict between national ruling classes. When the Soviet Union was attacked by Nazi Germany, however, the Comintern issued a directive ordering the formation of communist resistance movements in all European fascist-occupied territories and the Macedonian regional committee (RC) began organizing resistance. The RC (headed by Shatorov) immediately ordered the formation of partisan units – the first of which was formed in the Skopje region on 22 August 1941 – and attacked Bulgarian guards on 8 September in Bogomila, near Skopje. With the help of the Comintern and Joseph Stalin, the Macedonian Communists were attached to the CPY. Soon after this, Shatorov lost his popularity in the CPY and was discredited. Consequently he moved to Sofia, where he began working as one of the Bulgarian resistance movement leaders.\n<image>Svetozar Vukmanovic welcomes Macedonian and Greek Partisans in 1943 in occupied Greek Macedonia. Under his leadership, the pro-Bulgarian Regional committee was disbanded and pro-Yugoslav Macedonian Communist Party was founded.\nCPY loyalists were next appointed as leaders of the RC, with Lazar Koliševski secretary; in September 1941, Koliševski was sent to Skopje. The new leadership began forming partisan detachments. Armed insurgents from the Prilep partisan detachment attacked Axis-occupied zones in Prilep, including a Bulgarian police station, on 11 October. This date is considered the symbolic beginning of the Macedonian resistance. In November, Koliševski was arrested and sentenced to death by a Bulgarian military court. He wrote two appeals for clemency (to the Bulgarian tsar and the defence minister), insisting on his Bulgarian origin. Koliševski's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was imprisoned in Pleven, Bulgaria. The Prilep detachment was active until December, when it split into three groups: the first in Skopje, the second in Tikveš, and the third in Bitola.  \nSharlo's leadership was terminated, but elements of his policy were preserved by some of the local communist activists. After the arrest of Lazar Koliševski, the new executive body of the Macedonian RC continued to share Shatorov's pro-Bulgarian ideas and re-established contact with the BCP. Bane Andreev of Veles, Macedonia's new party secretary, expressed this ideology. He thought that the Macedonian people believed in Bulgaria's role as liberator, and no Macedonian wanted to fight Bulgarian soldiers; Macedonians should answer the Bulgarian mobilisation call and join the Bulgarian army. Josip Broz Tito, however, disagreed. Bane Andreev was arrested by Bulgarian police in the spring of 1942, worsening the struggle between pro-Bulgarian and pro-Yugoslav factions; Cvetko Uzunovski created a provisional regional committee which attempted to take over the pro-Bulgarian faction, with little success.  \nAlthough several Macedonian partisan detachments were formed through the end of 1942 which fought Bulgarian, Italian, German and Albanian occupation forces (and despite Sofia's mismanaged administration), most Macedonian communists were not yet lured to Yugoslavia. Between 1941 and 1943, Tito sent five emissaries to Macedonia to persuade his poorly-disciplined comrades; their efforts had limited success, however, and the regional committee was under the de facto control of the BCP. At the beginning of 1943, the Montenegrin Svetozar Vukmanović (\"Tempo\") was sent as an assistant to Macedonian partisan headquarters to change that. Tempo tried to organize an energetic resistance and was tasked with setting up a Macedonian communist party within the Yugoslav party. Some of his objectives were to destroy the influence of the BCP in Macedonia and to fight any form of autonomism.  \nVukmanović had to Macedonianize the struggle and give it a new ethnic-Macedonian facade. One of his main achievements was that wartime pro-Bulgarianism receded into the background of pro-Yugoslavism. He capitalised on the increasingly-contradictory attitudes of Bulgarian authorities, which adopted a policy of centralisation in 1942 (contradicting their initial agenda of respecting Macedonian autonomy). Yugoslav communists proclaimed as their aim the unification of Macedonia's three regions (Yugoslav, Greek and Bulgarian), attracting Macedonian nationalists. Tempo began to organise armed resistance to Bulgarian rule in earnest. Under Yugoslav pressure, the regional committee was dissolved and replaced by the Communist Party of Macedonia (KPM, part of the Yugoslav Communist Party). Formed on 19 March 1943 in the Albanian occupation zone in Tetovo, its first central committee was composed primarily of pro-Yugoslav communists. Yugoslav communists recognized a separate Macedonian nationality to stop the fears of the local population that they would continue the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# Mad Max (2015 video game)  \nMad Max is an action-adventure video game based on the Mad Max franchise. Developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, it was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in 2015. Feral Interactive published the game's Linux and macOS versions. In the game, players control Max Rockatansky as he progresses through the wasteland building a vehicle, the \"Magnum Opus\", to do battle with a gang of raiders, led by Scabrous Scrotus, and to reach the storied \"Plains of Silence\", where he hopes to find peace. Mad Max emphasizes vehicular combat, in which players can use weapon and armor upgrades on their car to fight enemies. It is set in an open post-apocalyptic wasteland consisting of deserts, canyons, and caves.  \nTwo other Mad Max games, developed by Cory Barlog and Interplay Entertainment respectively, were in production before the announcement of this game, but neither of them were successfully released. Although Mad Max is not based on the film series, it was inspired by its universe, and franchise creator George Miller was consulted during the game's pre-production. Avalanche Studios found developing a vehicular-combat video game a challenge because of their inexperience with creating that type of game. Announced at E3 2013, the game was re-tooled during development and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were canceled.  \nOriginally planned for release in 2014, it was released in September the following year, several months after the theatrical release of Mad Max: Fury Road, the fourth film in the series. Mad Max received overall mixed reviews from critics. Although the game's environment, direction, vehicular combat, and graphics were praised, its quest design and story were criticized. The game became the eighth best-selling retail game in the United States in September 2015.  \n## Gameplay  \nleft  \nMad Max is an action-adventure game set in an open world post-apocalyptic environment caused by resource shortages and ecocide. It emphasizes vehicular combat, in which the player is the eponymous Mad Max. According to its publisher, up to 60 percent of the game focuses on driving. Some weapons and tools, including flamethrowers and turbo boosts, are mounted directly onto the Magnum Opus, while others, such as a harpoon and sniper rifle, are used in conjunction with the vehicle by Chumbucket, Max's assistant, or Max himself. Max's Magnum Opus, with its V8 engine and powerful ramming ability, can destroy enemies' vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game changes to slow motion to allow the player to toggle between targets. Although Mad Max primarily uses a third-person perspective, the player can switch to first-person view when fighting enemies while driving the Magnum Opus. Chumbucket repairs the car when instructed to do so or when the player exits.  \nTo encourage exploration, the Magnum Opus can be upgraded with materials scavenged from the desert, by hijacking enemies' cars or collecting their car parts. An enemy can jump on top of the Magnum Opus to make it explode, but the player can avoid that by surrounding the car with hazards such as spikes. The player can access the garage screen throughout the game, allowing them to customize the Magnum Opus. Max's garage can change and modify the car's engine, chassis, wheels, body work, paint job, and its \"shell\". Upgrading one aspect of the car will negatively affect other aspects; upgrading the engine will allow Max to drive faster, but handling will be more difficult. The sound produced by the engine changes when the player changes, adds, or remove parts of the Magnum Opus. Max, his armor, and weapons are customisable; the player can unlock new skills and upgrades for him as he progresses through the game and earns experience points. Max is also customisable, with his clothing, appearance, fighting skills, and weapons being modifiable. Griffa, a wasteland wanderer, also offers Max tokens which can be used to upgrade his abilities.  \nAlthough the game has many choices (such as playing stealthily or aggressively), it emphasizes action over stealth. Mad Max features a variety of weapons, including Max's iconic shotgun, but ammunition is scarce and the game emphasizes melee combat over firearms. One weapon is the explosive Thunderstick, which can be lanced into an enemy's chest. The game has a free-flow combat system combining professional wrestling attacks and boxing techniques, similar to Warner Bros.' previous Batman: Arkham video-game series (in which indicators on enemies' heads remind the player when to strike, counter or make finishing moves). Attacks by Max during his \"frenzied\" state are more powerful than usual.  \nMad Maxs landscape consists of canyons, caves, deserts, and abandoned wastelands. The game's world is divided into several regions, with each having its own backstory and landscape. Unique landmarks and ruins can be discovered in each region. Side activities such as races, time trials, invading enemy fortresses, and eliminating enemy convoys can be found in each region. A region's threat level is lowered by completing these activities, facilitating its navigation. Each region has a boss, who can be found and defeated in their base. Some of the game's strongholds are friendly, and eliminating hostile strongholds gives Max additional quests and rewards. These strongholds can be upgraded, offering Max different benefits such as helping Max to collect scraps when the game is turned off, or restoring Max's health and shotgun ammo upon visits. Max can ascend in a hot-air balloon (permanently attached to the ground) to look for new objectives and locations. After seeing the objectives through binoculars, they are highlighted on the map. Max can be guided by Chumbucket in strategically completing his objectives. Max is accompanied by a dog companion who can help players detect land mines. Max has limited climbing abilities, and objects that he can climb are highlighted in yellow.  \nMost resources in the game are scarce except for gasoline, which is needed for driving. The player can collect one jerrycan at a time, storing it in the back of the Magnum Opus, and can find collectibles (history relics) throughout the game. The relics are primarily photos and notes of the wasteland before the apocalypse. Food and water are vital to Max's survival; the player can collect them in the wasteland and use them to replenish their health. Max can also eat small animals, such as rodents, and maggots from decomposing corpses, to replenish his health, and areas where he can find food and supplies have crows flying around them. As initially described, the player would be able to venture into the Big Nothing, an uncharted, volatile area of the wasteland with dangerous sandstorms and no food or water in which rare parts for the Magnum Opus could be found (according to Avalanche, the \"Big Nothing\" made the game map infinite) but ultimately this was not a feature of the final gameplay. A dynamic day-night cycle, a weather system and a variety of environmental hazards are included in the game, whose terrain is affected by weather and natural disasters.  \n## Plot  \nIn search of fuel, highway patrol officer-turned-survivalist Max Rockatansky (Bren Foster) journeys to the Plains of Silence. He runs into the War Boys led by Scabrous Scrotus (Travis Willingham), son of Immortan Joe (Fred Tatasciore) and ruler of Gastown. The War Boys run Max off the road and steal his car and supplies, leaving him to die in the desert. Max chases them and challenges Scrotus to a duel on the Land Mover. Scrotus sics his war hound on Max, but after Max fends off the dog, Scrotus throws it off the Land Mover in disgust. Max then stabs Scrotus in the head with his own chainsaw, but Scrotus kicks Max off the Land Mover.  \nBefriending the abandoned dog, Max obtains a weapon and clothes from a dead Wastelander. In the desert, Max finds a hunchbacked mechanic named Chumbucket (Jason Spisak) who calls him the Saint. Chumbucket leads Max to Scrotus and the War Boys and tells him that he is building a car, the Magnum Opus, but it lacks critical parts; Max agrees to search for them. Max must first liberate Wasteland leaders' territories from the War Boys: Jeet (Josh Keaton), whose stronghold is in an old lighthouse, and Gut Gash (Liam O'Brien), whose followers believe that they will be protected from a flood in their ship stronghold built on the remains of an oil tanker. He must penetrate a massive gate protected by War Boys, using the Magnum Opus outfitted with an exploding harpoon. Max and Chumbucket must then save Pink Eye (Adrienne Barbeau), a woman whose mechanical skill rivals Chumbucket's, from an invasion of her silo base led by Stank Gum—one of Scrotus' Top Dogs.  \nSearching for a V8 engine for the Magnum Opus, Max learns about a race in Gastown with a Big Chief V8 as a prize. After winning the race against Stank Gum (Yuri Lowenthal) and defeating the fighter Tenderloin in a Thunderdome duel, Max receives the engine and the concubine Hope (Courtenay Taylor). His victory is short-lived; Scrotus recognizes Max and attacks him. After he is shot with a crossbow and thrown down a mine shaft, Max is saved by Hope, who takes him to the Organic Mechanic and Scab (Orion Acaba)—also known as the Bloodbag. While Max is undergoing surgery, he has a hallucination that his wedding to Hope is officiated by Chumbucket and a man with a dog's head. When he wakes up, he and Hope steal the Big Chief; they drive to the temple of Deep Friah (Robin Atkin Downes), a friendly fire cultist.  \nAt the temple, Hope asks Max to find her daughter, Glory (Madison Carlon), who had fled to Buzzard territory. He travels to the Underdune and rescues Glory from the Buzzards. Returning, he discovers that Chumbucket took the Magnum Opus to his old home. Max follows him in one of Deep Friah's cars, but learns that Scrotus and Stank Gum tortured Chumbucket, who revealed Hope and Glory's location and their ties to Max. Max kills Stank Gum, rushes back to the temple and finds Hope hanged to death and Glory tortured on the floor. Glory dies in his arms, and Max swears vengeance against Scrotus.  \nHe returns to Gastown and learns Scrotus' location from Scab. Max and Chumbucket find Scrotus driving around the Purgatory Flatlands, and use the Magnum Opus to crash the Land Mover, which is pushed to the edge of a cliff. Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car at the start of the game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. Max enters the Interceptor and places a picture of his family on the dashboard as he heads off.  \n## Development  \n<image>George Miller provided input during the game's pre-production period.\nA video game set in the Mad Max universe was mentioned by franchise creator George Miller in a 2008 interview. Miller joined God of War II director Cory Barlog to develop the game after Barlog left Sony Computer Entertainment. The project was originally intended as a tie-in with a Mad Max animated film which would be released simultaneously. The film's production was suspended to allow adequate production time for the game. After Barlog announced in 2008 that a publisher for the game was being sought, no further information about the project was forthcoming. In 2010, Barlog was a consultant for Avalanche Studios, leaving in 2012 for Crystal Dynamics. A Fury Road tie-in video game was in development by Interplay Entertainment, but was scrapped when Electronic Arts acquired the franchise's video-game rights for $20 million.  \nOn 14 February 2013, a blurry screenshot of the game was released by Avalanche Studios founder and CEO Christofer Sundberg. The game was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 on 10 June at Sony's press conference, with a scheduled 2014 release for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. Although Sundberg said during the expo that Miller and Barlog's project was not the Mad Max game announced by Avalanche, he later said that Barlog had worked on a Mad Max game at Avalanche. Despite the unclear relationship between the projects, according to the game's design director, Miller had collaborated with Avalanche during the game's pre-production in mid-2011. Despite having Miller to offer input, Warner Bros. was inclined to give much creative freedom to Avalanche. Full production of the game began before May 2012.  \nIn April 2014, Avalanche announced that Mad Max would be delayed until the following year, making it one of the titles released during Avalanche's \"biggest year since its inception\". The game was retooled during development. Despite its release that year, the game is not directly connected to 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road and was not intended to be a tie-in; its setting and story are original. This decision was made because the game's publisher, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, believed that a standalone game was more beneficial to players than a \"play-the-movie game\" after the success of its Batman: Arkham series. Locations which have appeared in the films, such as Gas Town and Thunderdome, are featured in the game. Unlike previous Avalanche games, such as Just Cause 2, the game's tone is more mature and its narrative is emphasized.  \nSimilar to the films, Max seldom speaks or expresses emotion; his thoughts are reflected by his actions. The team aimed at developing a complex character and personality for him. According to the game's director, Max is traumatized by past experiences (such as losing his family); this makes him \"insane\", \"unstable\", and \"mad\". These qualities are reflected in the game's \"rage\" mode, in which Max inflicts additional damage on enemies. Chumbucket, Max's mechanic and companion, is obsessed with the Magnum Opus; according to the game's lead writer, he \"has a pseudo-religious/sexual relationship with engines\". Scabrous Scrotus, the game's main antagonist, is a warlord designed as a \"bloodthirsty monster that only can find solace from his own pain through the suffering of others\". Enemies' faces are painted and scarred; according to game director Frank Rooke, their appearance \"is kind of the approach of how this civilization merged into this kind of state\".  \nLead designer Emil Krafting said that gameplay was the top priority during development. Like the Just Cause series, Mad Maxs developer aimed to give players autonomy by providing tools to create their own events. The studios intended to build a dynamic world, creating \"a seamless series of events\". The game was inspired by the atmosphere of the Mad Max universe, rather than a particular film in the series. According to Avalanche, they did not plan to be influenced by other post-apocalyptic video games such as Fallout, Rage, and Borderlands since most of those games were inspired by the original Mad Max. The company said that the game's vehicular combat posed a challenge because of their inexperience with that type of game. The car customization system was designed to increase the game's fun factor and give players more freedom.  \nleft  \nThe game's world was inspired by the Just Cause series, which features large sandboxes for players to explore. Avalanche Studios CEO Christofer Sundberg hoped that players would compare Mad Maxs desert setting to the western setting of Red Dead Redemption. The game world is scaled according to gameplay density and frequency; the development team emphasized creating a world with choices and distractions, rather than focusing on size. Designed as dead, threatening, and hostile, it is also exciting and engaging (encouraging exploration). One challenge faced by the developers was building a wasteland with a variety of environments, since Mad Max is Avalanche's first post-apocalyptic game. They spent most of their time designing ground and terrain variations to minimize repetition in the landscape. Since the game is set in a desert, the team used vibrant colors for the sky. Avalanche Studios sent a team to a Costa Rican jungle to inspect local landscapes and environments in preparation for creating the world of Mad Max, particularly its sky. Like the films, the game does not identify the apocalypse; its developers wanted to give \"a sense of mystery\" to the wasteland so players could imagine how the wasteland evolved. Garages allowing players to upgrade and repair their cars were originally intended to be featured in the game. The idea was later scrapped, since the studio thought the element \"interfered with gameplay\".  \nMad Max is powered by Apex Engine (formerly known as Avalanche Engine), an in-house proprietary engine developed by Avalanche and also used in Just Cause 2. According to lead graphics designer Alvar Jansson, new graphical features were introduced to the engine during the development of Mad Max and it was designed and optimized for open-world games. The team also worked on improving the world's draw distance and ensuring that gameplay across the three major platforms have no significant difference.  \nGaming journalists invited to preview a private gameplay demonstration at E3 2013 noted that Max had an American accent, rather than the Australian accent of the film series, and fans protested his new American voice; Avalanche Studios later confirmed that he would have an Australian accent. Donal Gibson, the brother of the original Mad Max star Mel Gibson, expressed interest in taking the lead role in the video game adaptation. However, Australian actor Bren Foster, who previously starred in The Last Ship and Days of Our Lives, was chosen for the role. The game's setting is described as \"wasteland creole\", with elements of a number of civilizations, so its characters have a variety of accents.\n\n### Release  \n<image>Promotion at Gamescom 2015\nMad Max was released on 1 September 2015 in North America and the United Kingdom, 2 September in Australia, 3 September in New Zealand and 4 September in Europe for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It was announced on 3 May 2015 that the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions had been cancelled due to hardware restrictions, but a Linux port was announced. The game was released for Linux and macOS on 20 October 2016.  \nPlayers who pre-ordered the game could receive the Ripper, an additional Magnum Opus design. The Ripper, a steelbook, collector's box, mini-license plate and Blu-ray copy of Mad Max: Fury Road were included in the Post-Apocalypse Edition. PlayStation 4-version purchasers could access a Road Warrior Survival Kit, with twelve hood ornaments for the Magnum Opus, exclusively until 30 November 2015. To promote Mad Max, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment sponsored launch events. In Australia, the company invited artists to create artwork on their vehicles with dust. They joined Uber for a Seattle promotion in which Uber users could access a free ride \"straight from the post-apocalypse\". The offer was free, since \"dollars are worthless in the wasteland\".\n\n## Reception  \n### Critical reception  \nMad Max received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.  \nIts story received a mixed response. Brandin Tyrrel of IGN found the story surprising and genuine, despite most of the action occurring later in the game. Tyrrel wrote that the characters have different personalities and distinct qualities, and considered them the \"true star\" of the game. According to Chris Carter of Destructoid, the game's story engages the player. Leon Hurley of GamesRadar found the overall story weak and \"barely existing for the majority of the game\", but thought the game's climax was exciting. Matt Bertz of Game Informer also criticized the story, calling it thin and light, and called the voice actors' performances uneven.  \nMad Maxs world design received generally positive reviews. According to Brandin Tyrrel, it captured the films' savage tone and the game's sandbox was a \"gorgeous\" setting for players to explore. GamesRadar's Leon Hurley praised the game's scale, which he compared to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Martin Robinson of Eurogamer compared its scale favorably to Avalanche's previous Just Cause game series, and opined that Avalanche had successfully combined the Mad Max universe with an open-world game design. Matt Bertz praised the game's inhospitable atmosphere, commending Avalanche for adding a variety of styles and a vibrant sky to an otherwise-boring sandbox. Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers echoed Bertz, calling each region unique and distinct. Bloodworth also praised Avalanche for its efforts in crafting the world. Peter Brown of GameSpot praised Mad Maxs natural disasters, writing that it set a new standard for in-game weather effects. Philip Kollar of Polygon criticized the game's layout, writing that every location in the game feels identical and its bland environments discourage exploration.  \nTyrrel considered the vehicular combat one of the game's best elements, adding a layer of creativity. Brown praised the car action, calling it intense, complex, and unpredictable, but criticized the over-simplistic and shallow on-foot combat. Carter compared the game's vehicular controls to the best racing games, and commended its handling. He also praised the car mechanics, writing that it has offered players a cinematic experience. Tyrrel liked the additions to the game's combat (such as the introduction of weapons and the Fury mode), writing that they added depth to the combat. Hurley praised the game's progression system, which he found satisfying, and the balance between vehicular and on-foot combat. Bloodworth wrote that the melee combat used a \"tried-and-true system\" which worked well, despite awkward camera angles. Kollar criticized the boss fights, which he thought lacked variety.  \nOther gameplay aspects received mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised the customization system for Max and the Magnum Opus, since the customization impacts the gameplay and makes the overall experience more rewarding; Kollar echoed this. Brown criticized the game for failing to offer much challenge or a sense of accomplishment to players. He called the health system a redundant addition in which resources, such as water and food, play an insignificant role and can be neglected by players. Brown also criticized the scrap-collecting system, writing that it frustrated most players and slowed the game's pace. However, Robinson wrote that those elements reflect the barbarian nature of the wasteland. He praised its world design (which he thought echoed the films), describing it as \"a world of twisted metal and sudden violence that's there to be survived rather than conquered\". Bloodworth criticized the game's stronghold system, which he called repetitive. Brown criticized the game's lack of a climbing system, which hinders movement; this was echoed by Carter.  \nMad Maxs quest design also received mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised the content and activities scattered across the world, calling the activities engaging for most players. However, he disliked the repetition which dragged down their replay value. Hurley found it easy for players to become confused in the game's early stages, since the objectives are unclear. Brown criticized the structure of several quests which force players to use a certain method, removing freedom and creativity. Chris Carter of Destructoid wrote that the game brought nothing new to the genre, and its quests and features were too similar to typical Ubisoft open-world design.  \nThe game had some technical problems when it was released. Tyrrel noted an unstable frame rate and occasional texture pop-up, and Kollar identified audio problems.  \n### Sales  \nMad Max was the second-best selling game in the United Kingdom in its first week of release on the United Kingdom software retail chart, only behind Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, which was released the same day. According to the NPD Group, it was the eighth-best selling game in the United States in September 2015.\n\nQuestion: Which notable figure from the Mad Max franchise provided input during the pre-production period of the Mad Max video game?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Bernard Dujon  \nBernard Dujon in 2002  \nBernard Dujon is a French geneticist, born on August 8, 1947, in Meudon (Hauts-de-Seine). He is Professor Emeritus at Sorbonne University and the Institut Pasteur since 2015. He is a member of the French Academy of sciences.  \n## Early life and education  \nBernard Dujon grew up as a teenager in the Paris suburban area and went to school at Maisons-Lafitte, where his parents settled in 1958. He became interested in biology very early and at the age of eleven started collecting biological material from his natural environment, plants, fossils, insects, shells, etc. He became in 1965 a laureate of the./Https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concours%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral Concours Général des Lycées, a nation-wide yearly contest, at the same time he was obtaining his baccalauréat. He started a degree of biology at the Faculté des Sciences de Paris the same year. He graduated in the top 1% of students and was offered the opportunity to compete for an oral exam at the prestigious Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS rue d'Ulm), was ranked first and admitted there the following year (1966). He therefore became a normalien at the early age of 19, when most of the students attracted by this career are still preparing in specialized schools for this written and oral competition. There, he attended lectures at the Faculté de Sciences for two years, before choosing Genetics as a specialization during his third year. After a master's degree in Genetics from Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris (1968), he received a Diploma of Advanced Studies (DEA) in Advanced Genetics (1969). Subsequently, instead of preparing the agrégation, that would have ensured a permanent position in the education system, he decided to follow doctorate studies under the supervision of Piotr Slonimski, a Polish-French geneticist, at the CNRS campus of Gif-sur-Yvette, in the southern parisian suburban area. At the same time, he was recruited as a junior scientist by the CNRS (1970), allowing him to complete his PhD thesis, while earning a salary to support his family. He eventually obtained a Doctorate in Natural Sciences, specializing in Genetics, in 1976, from the Pierre and Marie Curie University.  \n## Functions in science and education  \nHe was a trainee, then attaché, chargé and research master at the CNRS from 1970 to 1983, then a Professor at the Pierre and Marie Curie University from 1983 to 2015, at the same time part-time assistant professor at the Ecole Polytechnique (1984-1988). From 1989 to 1992 he was Head of Laboratory at the Institut Pasteur, then Professor from 1993 to 2015. He was the head of the Unité de Génétique Moléculaire des Levures from 1989 to his retirement in 2015.  \nAmong the other functions occupied during his career, he has been appointed scientific deputy director general of the Institut Pasteur from 2006 to 2008, by the director general, Alice Dautry, and from 1997 to 2011 he was a senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France. He is Emeritus Professor at the Institut Pasteur.  \n## Scientific achievements  \nBernard Dujon scientific work focuses on the genetic material of eukaryotic organisms, its organization, dynamics, functioning and evolution.  Most of his work has used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as experimental material, but he also got interested in studying other yeasts of biotechnological or medical interest, such as Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida glabrata.  \n### The early years : discovery of the first homing endonuclease  \n<image>Bernard Dujon (second from the left) and François Jacob (right) attending a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory meeting in the 1980s.\nIn Gif-sur-Yvette, Bernard Dujon started to study a strange genetic phenomenon, linked to mitochondrial genetics, whose study was still in infancy. When crossing two haploid yeast species carrying different mitochondrial mutations, conferring the resistance to erythromycin or to chloramphenicol, allele segregation did not follow mendelian rules and recombinants appeared in mysterious proportions. At that time, no one had any idea of the genetic content of mitochondria, except that it contained DNA. Bernard Dujon was studying a particular mitochondrial locus, called omega, that could be present as two different alleles, omega+ or omega-. Genetic crosses between yeast cells carrying different alleles led to highly distorted inheritance in the progeny, since almost all cells ended up carrying the omega+ allele! In 1974, he proposed a model in which gene conversion of the omega- allele to omega+ was achieved by homologous recombination, replacing one allele by the other, copying in the process the flanking erythromycin and chloramphenicol mutations.  \nAt about the same time, recombinant DNA technologies and restriction enzymes were discovered. In 1977, independent researches by Fred Sanger on one side and by Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam on the other, led to the invention of two different methods to sequence DNA. Later the same year, introns were discovered. Thermal denaturation studies with François Michel, another student of Piotr Slonimski, suggested that omega could be an intron. Bernard Dujon contacted Walter Gilbert at Harvard University about the possibility to come to his lab for a short post-doctoral period, in order to sequence the omega locus. He moved to Harvard the following year and in 1979 achieved the sequence of what would become the first mobile intron to be described. But the most surprising result was not that omega was indeed an intron, but that it contained an open reading frame, putatively encoding a 235 amino acid protein with no homology to any known protein. At that time, no intron was supposed to be coding. Could it be that the encoded protein played a role in the intron mobility between omega- and omega+ strains?  \nBack to Gif-sur-Yvette in 1981, Bernard Dujon set up a small team in an old lab space lent by Piotr Slonimski. François Michel rapidly joined him and later on Alain Jacquier, Hugues Blanc, Pierre Dehoux and Laurence Colleaux, as well as sabbatical visitors such as Walt Fangman from the University of Washington. They discovered that the omega intron was present in other yeast species collected in Harvard. Following the sequencing of several other introns, François Michel discovered that these introns could be folded into stem-loops whose structures (if not their sequences) were conserved. This suggested that they could be directly involved in the splicing mechanism by defining exon-intron junctions. In addition, they discovered that two different intronic structures existed, defining what they called group I and group II introns, a nomenclature still in use today. They published their models of intron folding in Biochimie in 1982 and this article quickly became a reference for researchers in the field.  \nBut the precise function of the omega-encoded protein was still unknown. Bernard Dujon decided to adapt the mitochondrial gene to the universal genetic code in order to be able to express it in a heterologous system. At that time, it was a real tour de force, since oligonucleotide synthesis and in vitro mutagenesis were uncommon and not available in Gif-sur-Yvette. Fortunately, Bernard Dujon met Francis Galibert, who was working at the Hôpital Saint Louis in Paris and who just came back from Fred Sanger laboratory to set up his own lab. At that time, he was the only one in France to be able to synthesize oligonucleotides. With the help of Francis Galibert's oligonucleotides, Bernard Dujon modified 26 of the 235 codons of the omega reading frame to adapt it to the universal genetic code. Synthesis of the resulting protein in Escherichia coli, in the presence of a plasmid carrying the omega-sequence showed without any ambiguity, in 1985, that the omega protein was a double-strand DNA endonuclease, as was predicted by the model 12 years ago. This nuclease took afterwards the conventional name of I-SceI, the first intron homing endonuclease discovered, first of its kind but dozens of others would rapidly follow.  \nIn 1987, a call for a yeast geneticist was published by the Institut Pasteur. Bernard Dujon applied and left Gif-sur-Yvette to move to Paris. In this new scientific environment, he used I-SceI to the purpose of making unique double-strand breaks in complex genomes, such as mouse, plants or the human genome, in collaboration with many scientists worldwide. In collaboration with the laboratory of Jean-François Nicolas at the Institut Pasteur, Arnaud Perrin and André Choulika (who would later become two founding members of the biotech company Cellectis) were able to do the first gene replacement in mouse cells using I-SceI, at the same time Maria Jasin in United States was doing similar experiments in human cells.\n\n### The yeast genome project  \nThe \"yeast teams\" of the Institut Pasteur in 1995. Pierre Legrain (second from the right) and Alain Jacquier (not on this picture) set up their own yeast laboratory in 1995, as the first \"bud\" of Bernard Dujon (left) laboratory. Several young researchers and students on this picture have since set up their own laboratory.  \nIn 1988, André Goffeau, a Belgian yeast geneticist from the University of Louvain-la-Neuve convinced the European Commission to support the complete sequencing of the yeast genome. Under his management, 30 European laboratories collaborated to this endeavor. Their goal was to sequence 10 kb of DNA in two years of time, in order to complete chromosome III sequence, one of the smallest ones. Later on, they were joined by other labs worldwide to help sequencing the 15 other chromosomes. Bernard Dujon took an active part in this project and was one of the leading figures of the yeast program. He coordinated the sequencing of two chromosomes out of sixteen (XI and XV) and the map of a third chromosome (VII) was made by Hervé Tettelin, André Goffeau's student, using the I-SceI chromosome fragmentation technology developed in the meantime. The yeast genome sequence was completed in 1995 and published one year later. During the course of this project, it was discovered that one third of the sequenced genes had no homologue in any database (the so-called \"orphans\"). The extremely high level of gene redundancy, due -at least in part- to an ancient whole-genome duplication in the ancestor of Saccharomyces species, led to a new era in biology. Genomics, freshly born as a new science, will be studying entire genomes, instead of individual genes, and try to understand genome organization and evolution.  \n### The Génolevures program  \nBernard Dujon laboratory at the departemental retreat in Normandy, in 2002. From left to right (standing): Bernard Dujon, Romain Koszul, Ingrid Lafontaine, Martine Rambaud, Stefan Pellenz, Jeanne Boyer, Christophe Hennequin, Emmanuel Talla, Agnès Thierry, Odile Ozier-Kalogeropoulos, Fredj Tekaia, Gilles Fischer, Cécile Fairhead. From left to right (sat): Guy-Franck Richard, Emmanuelle Fabre.  \nWhile Bernard Dujon was participating to the EUROFAN program, aiming at determining the function of all discovered genes, he started a completely different approach, based on yeast comparative genomics. Odile Ozier-Kalogeropoulos and her Master student, Alain Malpertuy, had produced 600 sequence reads of a yeast of biotechnological interest, Kluyveromyces lactis. This allowed them to identify hundreds of new genes by direct comparison with the S. cerevisiae genome. By analogy with Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) that were widely used at that time as a proxy to estimate the number of different human genes and their expression tissues, Alain Malpertuy coined these sequences Random Sequence Tags (RST) and the acronym was subsequently kept for further similar studies.  \nFollowing an informal discussion with Jean Weissenbach, head of the Génoscope, the largest sequencing center in France, Bernard Dujon contacted two French geneticists who were known to be interested in non-conventional yeast species: Jean-Luc Souciet at the University of Strasbourg and Claude Gaillardin at the National Center for Agronomy (INRA) in Grignon. Together, with several French laboratories sharing similar scientific interests, they decided to sequence to low coverage 13 yeast species representing the various branches of the Saccharomycotina (formerly known as Hemiascomycetes), some of them of biotechnological or medical interest. At the end of the year 1998, the Génoscope offered 50 000 sequence reads for this project, 40 millions of nucleotides, roughly corresponding to 0.2-0.4 X coverage of each of the 13 genomes. Altogether, 20 000 new genes were discovered and allowed to compare sequence divergence, synteny, gene redundancy and functions among these 13 species and between them and S. cerevisiae. These yeasts revealed at the level of their genomes, large evolutionary distances between them. Their comparison made possible to develop new theories on the molecular mechanisms of evolution of eukaryotic genomes which, thanks to the power of genetics in S. cerevisiae, can be directly subjected to experimentation. Results were published in a special issue of FEBS Letters, edited by Horst Feldman and appeared in press just a few days before the end of the 20th century.  \nBernard Dujon and one of his PhD students, Stefan Pellenz, at the Institut Pasteur in 2004.  \nFollowing this project, a landmark for subsequent yeast comparative genomics studies, the CNRS offered to support the French consortium, under the name Génolevures (levure being the French word for yeast). Note that the financial support was limited to coordination, but did not cover sequencing nor subsequent data analysis. The Génolevures consortium sequenced to completion four yeast genomes, Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis, Debaryomyces hansenii and Yarrowia lipolytica. Numerous functional and comparative studies were made from these sequences, including genes involved in replication, recombination and repair, mating and meiosis, short and long tandem repeats, tRNA genes, introns, pseudogenes, telomeres and subtelomeres and evolution of the genetic code. These results were published in Nature, as well as in several other scientific journals.  \n### The origin of genes and chromosomal amplifications  \nSequencing yeast genomes led to the discovery of many new genes of unknown function, phylogenetically unrelated. This led to the question of their very origin. Bernard Dujon tried to tackle this problem by setting up an experimental system to study the evolution of tRNA genes. During the course of these experiments, he discovered that yeast strains in which an essential amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase had been replaced by its homologue from Yarrowia lipolytica, a distantly related yeast, were severely unfit. However, normal growth revertants appeared in the culture at a high frequency. Whole-genome sequencing of these mutants showed that the chromosomal segment containing the foreign tRNA synthetase had been amplified by a rolling circle mechanism, creating a variety of aberrant chromosomal structures under constant evolution. While looking for tRNA duplication, Bernard Dujon discovered the amplification of its cognate tRNA synthetase.  \n### Interspecific hybridizations  \nFascinated by interspecific hybridizations that spontaneously occurred frequently in nature, Bernard Dujon last scientific project was to create artificial yeast species resulting from forced hybridization between two known yeast species and to study genome evolution of these new hybrids. This was the PhD project of Lucia Morales, last of the many students trained by Bernard Dujon over the course of his long career. Making these hybrids at the bench proved to me much more challenging than initially expected, suggesting that laboratory conditions may not favor interspecific hybridizations between distant yeast species.  \n### Bernard Dujon legacy  \n<image>Bernard Dujon (left) and his colleagues (Eric Westhof), wearing the \"Habit vert\" of the Institut de France.\nBernard Dujon retired in 2015, at the age of 68 and became Emeritus Professor. Over the 26 years during which the Unité de Génétique Moléculaire des Levures was operating, more than 120 people have worked there, 250 scientific publications were produced shared with more than 800 colleagues all over the world and 22 PhD thesis and Habilitations à diriger des recherches were defended. As Bernard Dujon put it at the end of his retirement talk, in March 2016: \"Scientific research was a successful globalization.\"  \nMany of his former students or post-docs have continued in biological research or related fields, many of them obtaining positions in academic research and starting their own lab in France or abroad (alphabetically): Guillaume Chanfreau (UCLA), Laurence Colleaux (Institut Imagine), Alain Jacquier (Institut Pasteur), Romain Koszul (Institut Pasteur), Emmanuelle Fabre (Hôpital Saint Louis), Cécile Fairhead (Université Paris-Saclay), Gilles Fischer (Sorbonne Université), Bertrand Llorente (Université Aix-Marseille), François Michel (Gif-sur-Yvette), Anne Plessis (Université Paris Diderot), Emmanuel Talla (Université Aix-Marseille), Hervé Tettelin (University of Maryland) and Teresa Teixeira-Fernandes (Sorbonne Université).\n\n### Scientific books  \nBernard Dujon is the author of a vulgarization book on genetics, as well as of a textbook entitled Trajectoires de la génétique. He recently published a recollection of his scientific -and personal- life in FEMS Yeast Research.  \n## Honors and awards  \nHe is a member of Academia Europaea (since 2000), a member of the French Academy of sciences (since 2002), and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Inventors since 2017.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Music of Portal 2  \nPortal 2 is a physics-based puzzle-platform game created by Valve and released on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Linux in April 2011, followed by a Nintendo Switch version in June 2022. The game, set in the desolate, labyrinthine Aperture Science facility, challenges the player to navigate test chambers created by the artificial intelligence GLaDOS, using a portal gun, a device able to create portals that link two points in space like a wormhole. The game expands on the original Portal by adding new puzzle elements, such as paint that imparts properties to surfaces, plates that can launch the player and objects over distances, tractor beams and bridges made of light.  \nThe game's music includes original scores composed by Valve's Mike Morasky, and two original songs provided by Jonathan Coulton and the band The National. The bulk of the music was released as a freely-available download across three volumes, entitled Songs to Test By, and later in a four-disc retail Collector's edition that included music from Portal.  \n## \"Want You Gone\"  \n<image>Jonathan Coulton, who provided the song \"Still Alive\" for the first Portal, was asked to compose the game's final credits song, \"Want You Gone\".\nJonathan Coulton's song \"Still Alive\", which is sung by GLaDOS (voiced by Ellen McLain) over Portals end credits, was considered a large part of Portal's success; in designing Portal 2, Valve desired to incorporate more music into the game, including further involvement from Coulton. Coulton wrote a new song for the game's ending credits, \"Want You Gone\", also written from GLaDOS's viewpoint. Coulton had discussed with Erik Wolpaw about whether an ending song would be necessary, and how they could create \"an emotional moment\" comparable to \"Still Alive\", back in 2009 when Portal 2s ending was not yet determined. Other options were considered, such as several \"joke songs\" and false endings for the game. Ultimately the game's finale, where GLaDOS effectively \"breaks up\" with Chell, was set by the last quarter of 2010, and Coulton played the game as it had been developed to that point to generate ideas. Elements of the ending, such as Chell being told to leave Aperture with the door slamming behind her, led to the development of main chorus line \"I used to want you dead, but now I only want you gone.\" Coulton wrote the lyrics and composed the song over the course of several days, with John Flansburgh assisting on electronic drums, and traveled to Valve's headquarters in January 2011 to record it with McLain.  \nIn addition to its inclusion in the Portal 2 soundtrack, a version of \"Want You Gone\" as sung by Coulton appears on his 2011 album Artificial Heart.\n\n## \"Exile Vilify\"  \n<image>The band The National worked with Valve to create the haunting \"Exile Vilify\" used in conjunction with one of the dens of the Rat Man within the game.\nThe indie rock band The National provided another original song, \"Exile Vilify\"; its lyrics were composed by the group and reviewed by Valve to ensure they fit with the tone of one of the Rattmann's dens, where it appears in-game. The National had expressed an interest in doing music for Valve to Bug Music, their publishing label, which the label forwarded on to Valve in discussing other music opportunities for the game. Valve and Bug Music identified that The National would fit well into Portal 2, as their \"raw and emotive music evokes the same visceral reactions from its listeners that Portal does from its players\" according to Bug Music's spokesperson Julia Betley. The song is considered by Paste to be a \"haunted, piano-lead ballad\" similar to the band's song \"Think You Can Wait\"  used in the film Win Win. \"Exile Vilify\" is not included in the freely downloadable Portal 2 soundtrack, but instead was released as a digital single by the band.  \nAfter the game's release, Valve and The National ran a contest encouraging users to create their own music video for \"Exile Vilify\", offering as prizes Valve merchandise and a guitar signed by members of the band. Of 320 videos submitted, Valve ultimately awarded two videos first prize. One video featured a sock puppet that \"had nothing to do with Portal\" but \"managed to beautifully capture the spirit of the song\", while the other provided an animated retelling of the Lab Rat comic.\n\n## Original music  \nValve's Mike Morasky was the lead composer for the game's backing music. In keeping with the theme from Portal, Morasky wanted to create music that kept an \"old future through a new lens\" approach, such as by using minimalist electronic piano or mangled chiptunes. He also wanted to create music that would sound like it would have been composed by a computer, citing the use of \"stiff arpeggios, math-like voice leading, odd rhythm patterns and whole tone scales\" as a means to achieve this. Morasky also incorporated the briefly-seen singing turrets—all voiced by McLain— in the piece \"Cara Mia Addio!\" after recalling that she was a former opera singer, and used snippets of her singing to create something that still sounded synthetic. Except for McLain's vocals, all the music is based on synthesized or sampled sounds, and even with McLain, her voice was resampled to make it sound like a computer. McLain wrote \"GLaDOS' Song\" (possibly better known as \"Don't Say Goodbye\") from the character's point of view, showing GLaDOS' more sentimental connection to Chell. She intended it to be an Easter egg, though it was not used in the game. Jagger Gravning of Vice later had her record the song with her husband John Patrick Lowrie, and Lowrie uploaded it to YouTube in 2015.  \nMorasky created procedurally generated music, which is generated in real time based on the player's actions. This type of music system was based on the previous success of incidental music used in the Left 4 Dead series, and was developed to create a generalized platform for reuse in future Valve productions. Such music is generated by the player's interaction with various puzzle objects in the test chambers, such as launching from an Aerial Faith Plate. Morasky designed the procedure to build out the music more as the player completed more of each puzzle. Morasky also saw this as a means to provide experimentation to the player, exploring both space and timing of events to alter the composition of the music.  Morasky claims that one piece of music \"only repeats itself every 76,911 years, 125 days, 7 hours, 56 minutes and 30.3 seconds\". Morasky designed this dynamic music as a reward for successfully completing puzzles.  \n## Songs to Test By  \nSongs to Test By is the three-volume soundtrack for Portal 2, containing nearly all of the music from the game.  The soundtrack was released freely to the Internet volume-by-volume between May and September 2011.  Along with the soundtrack, Valve included several Portal 2-themed ringtones.  \n### Soundtrack listing  \nAll tracks are written by Mike Morasky unless otherwise noted.  \nA retail four-disc collection, Portal 2: Songs to Test By (Collector's Edition), was released on October 30, 2012 through Ipecac Recordings. Three of the discs include the music already available (listed above), while the fourth disc includes songs from Portal. A mini-comic, \"Turret Lullaby\", is also included.  \n## Reception  \nKym Dillon of IGN used the soundtrack of Portal 2, amongst a few other soundtracks, as an example how a game can use both source music (music that is part of the game environment) and underscoring (music that is only for the player) to create atmosphere in games; Dillon also mentions that he \"especially\" liked the game's soundtrack. Alyssa Grimley of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised Morasky's composing of the soundtrack and called it an \"understated genius\". She also praised Jonathan Coulton's song \"Want You Gone\" for the way in which it reflects the changed spirit of GLaDOS when compared to \"Still Alive\" from the first game. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku listed Portal 2 as possessing one of the best musical scores in video games for 2011, praising both the composed songs and the dynamically-generated elements.  \nFor the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, both \"Want You Gone\" and \"Exile Vilify\" were nominated for \"Best Song in a Game\", while the soundtrack was nominated for \"Best Original Score\". Portal 2s soundtrack was awarded for \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\" at the 15th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. The game was awarded the \"Best Audio\" 2012 Game Developers Choice Awards. The Game Audio Network Guild awarded Portal 2 with the \"Best Interactive Score\" (along with Kinect Disneyland Adventures), and \"Best Original Vocal - Pop\" for \"Want You Gone\".\n\nQuestion: Which artist or band was involved in creating an original song for the game Portal 2's ending credits?\nChoice list: \nA.

British troops occupying the Togolese capital of Lomé on the coast, had advanced towards a wireless station at Kamina, mi inland on hills near Atakpamé. The only routes inland were by the railway and road, which had been built through dense and almost impassable jungle.  \nTwo trainloads of German troops steamed south to engage the British and delay the Anglo-French invasion but were ambushed at Agbulovhoe, suffered many casualties and fled, leaving mi of the railway to the north intact. After a halt of three days to accumulate supplies, the British advance resumed with support from French lang|fr|Tirailleurs Sénégalais. The German colonial forces were capable of only one more defensive action at the Affair of Khra on 22 August. The Germans blew up the wireless transmitter at Kamina on the night of 24/25 August and the colony was surrendered the next day.  \n## Background  \n### Strategic developments  \nAn Offensive Sub-Committee of the British Committee of Imperial Defence was appointed on 5 August and established a principle that command of the seas was to be ensured. Territorial objectives were considered if they could be attained with local forces and if the objective assisted the priority of maintaining British sea communications, as British army garrisons abroad were returned to Europe in an \"Imperial Concentration\". Attacks on German coaling stations and wireless stations were considered to be important, to clear the seas of German commerce raiders. Objectives at Tsingtau, Luderitz Bay, Windhoek, Duala and Dar-es-Salaam were considered and a German wireless station in Togoland, next to the British colony of Gold Coast (now Ghana) on the Gulf of Guinea, was considered vulnerable to attack by local forces.  \nThe high-power wireless transmitter had been built at Kamina and controlled German communication in the Atlantic Ocean, by linking a German transmitter at Nauen near Berlin with German colonies in west Africa and south America. At the outbreak of war, the German acting-Governor of Togoland, who had 152 paramilitary police, 416 local police and 125 border guards but no regular army forces, had proposed neutrality to the British and French colonial authorities under the Congo Act 1885 and then withdrawn from Lomé and the coastal region, when the British demanded unconditional surrender. The acting-Governor, Major Hans-Georg von Doering had sent an un-coded wireless message to Berlin disclosing his plan to retreat to Kamina, which had been intercepted by the British and led to offensive operations against Kamina being authorised by the Colonial Office on 9 August. Anglo-French expeditions from northern Dahomey, Nigeria and the Gold Coast began on 12 August.  \n### Tactical developments  \nOn 6 August 1914, the British and French governments summoned the German authorities in Togoland to surrender; Anglo-French forces invaded the colony and occupied Lomé unopposed on 7 August and by 12 August, the southern portion of the colony was under Anglo-French control. In northern Togoland British and French troops, police and irregulars occupied Yendi and Mango on 14 August. In the south, the lang|de|Polizeitruppen had withdrawn to the wireless station at Kamina, about order=flip inland. As British and French forces advanced towards Kamina, the German commanders, acting-Governor Major Hans-Georg von Doering and the military commander, Captain Georg Pfähler attempted to delay the Allied advances by blowing bridges. The main British and French thrusts came from the south, where well built roads and railways from the coast made movement easy for both sides. To harass the West African Rifles of the West African Frontier Force (WAFF), German commanders filled two trains with  200 German soldiers and sent them south to raid the Allies on 15 August 1914.  \n## Engagement  \n<image>Gulf of Guinea, showing the location of Togo and the modern states of Ghana and Benin (formerly Dahomey)\nBy 14 August the British had reached Tsevié unopposed and patrols reported the country south of Agbeluvoe clear of German forces. The main British force assembled at Togblekove and \"I\" Company (Captain H. B. Potter) was sent forward by road to Agbeluvoe, followed by the main body on 15 August. When the main force reached Dawie, civilians reported that a train full of Germans had shot up the station at Tsevié earlier that morning. At Tsevié the British found that the train had steamed north and hurried on to support \"I\" Company. \"I\" Company had heard the train run south at 4:00 a.m. while halted on the road near Ekuni. A section was sent to cut off the train and the rest of \"I\" Company pressed on to Agbeluvoe. A local civilian guided the section to the railway, where Lieutenant H. S. Collins and the section piled stones and a heavy iron plate on the tracks, about m north of the bridge at Ekuni, a village about km south of Agbeluvoe and then set an ambush.  \nA second train, carrying Captain Georg Pfähler, commander of the German forces in Togoland, stopped in front of the obstacle and managed to reverse before the ambushers reached it. The rest of \"I\" Company had heard the train pass, set another ambush and riddled the engine with bullets as it travelled past at full steam. The British parties rendezvoused and advanced to Agbeluvoe, where another road and rail block was established. Both trains were south of Agbeluvoe and the convoy of carriers with \"I\" Company's supplies was harassed by German attacks for two hours before they arrived at the British position. The position at Agbeluvoe had been attacked several times from the south; more attacks overnight were repulsed. As the main British force drew close, the Germans retired towards their train and eventually surrendered. The main force under Colonel F. C. Bryant had been engaged by a German party on the afternoon of 15 August at the Lila River, where the Germans blew the bridge and then retired to a ridge where they fought a delaying action holding up the British until 4:30 p.m. Three German dead were left behind; the British lost one man killed and three wounded. When the advance resumed the British reached Ekuni and found twenty railway carriages, which had been derailed by the obstruction near the bridge.\n<image>Dahomey–Togo boundary. LOC 85697543\nMany of the German soldiers reportedly took off their uniforms, threw down their guns and ran into the bush at the sight of the British ambush. The remaining Germans retreated northwards to Agbeluvoe where further fighting ensued, in which Pfähler was killed.2003 A German prisoner wrote an account in September, which described the German force at Agbeluvoe as two companies of local soldiers, commanded by Pfähler. An attempt to break through the \"I\" Company road and rail block collapsed when the Togolese troops refused orders and then began shooting in all directions. Six Germans were killed including Pfähler, after which the troops fled; the remnants failed to contact Kamina and news of the disaster was eventually delivered by a German train driver who had been fired on at Agbeluvoe.  \nNext morning Baron Cordelli von Fahnenfeldt, who had designed the wireless station at Kamina and the German explosives expert were captured; the column set off for Agbeluvoe, no news having arrived from \"I\" Company. Slight opposition was met half way to the station and much abandoned equipment was found. Firing was heard until about km from Agbeluvoe, where most of the  200 German troops from the trains were found to have been captured, along with two trains, wagons, a machine-gun, rifles and much ammunition. The Germans who escaped proved too demoralised to conduct demolitions and km of track were taken undamaged. The British lost six killed and 35 wounded, some of whom had injuries which raised suspicions that the Germans had used soft-nosed bullets, which was later discovered to have been partly true, as some hurriedly incorporated reservists had used their civilian hunting ammunition.\n\n## Aftermath  \n### Analysis  \nThe Germans lost a quarter of their troops in the attempt to use the railway to harass British forces to the south. It was considered a great failure and defeat for the Germans in Togoland. Although it may briefly have delayed the British northward advance, which was not resumed until 19 August, the Affair of Agbeluvoe had no lasting effect on the advance of the Allies. The wireless station at Kamina was demolished by the Germans, which cut off German ships in the South Atlantic from communication with Europe and influenced the Battle of the Falkland Islands (8 December 1914). On 26 August, eleven days after the battle, Doering surrendered. The German force of  1,500 men comprising one German and seven Togolese companies, had been expected to be most difficult to defeat, given the terrain and the extensive entrenchments at Kamina. A German prisoner later wrote that few of the Germans had military training, the defences of Kamina had been too large for the garrison to defend and were ringed by hills. The Germans were not able to obtain information about the British in the neighbouring Gold Coast (Ghana) and instructions by wireless from Berlin only insisted that the transmitting station be protected. In the first three weeks of August, the transmitter had passed 229 messages from Nauen to German colonies and German shipping. Defence of the transmitter had wider operational effects but Doering made no attempt at protracted resistance.  \n### Casualties  \nThe British suffered  83 casualties and the German forces  41 casualties at the Affair of Agbeluvoe.  \n### Subsequent operations  \nOn 22 August the Affair of Khra was fought by the Anglo-French invaders and the Germans on the Khra River and in Khra (Chra) village. The German forces had dug in and repulsed the Anglo-French attack. A new attack on 23 August found that the Germans had retired further inland to Kamina. By the end of the campaign, six of seven provinces had been abandoned by the Germans, bridges had not been blown and only the Khra river line among the three possible water obstacles had been defended. The speed of the invasion by several British and French columns, whose size was over-estimated and lack of local support for the colonial regime, had been insuperable obstacles for the German colonialists. Togoland was occupied by the British and French for the duration of the war.\n\nQuestion: Which event is depicted in the descriptions of the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

A prequel to Chase's HBO crime drama series The Sopranos, it takes place during the 1960s and 1970s in Newark, New Jersey. The film follows a violent gang war from the perspectives of mobster Dickie Moltisanti and his teenage nephew, Tony Soprano, in the midst of the city's 1967 riots. It stars Alessandro Nivola as Dickie and Michael Gandolfini as Tony, the character originated by his father in the series, with Leslie Odom Jr., Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, Billy Magnussen, Michela De Rossi, John Magaro, Ray Liotta, and Vera Farmiga in supporting roles. This marks Liotta's final release performance before his death the following year.  \nWarner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema obtained the rights to produce The Many Saints of Newark alongside HBO Films. The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Fall Preview on September 22, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 1, along with a month-long simultaneous release on the HBO Max streaming service. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances of Gandolfini and Nivola, though some criticized the script. During its theatrical release, the film grossed $13 million against a budget of $50 million, but it was a streaming success on HBO Max and contributed to a spike in viewership for The Sopranos.  \n## Plot  \nIn 1967, a young Tony Soprano travels with his mentor, Dickie Moltisanti, to welcome home Dickie's father, \"Hollywood Dick\" Moltisanti, and his new Italian bride, Giuseppina. Moltisanti is a soldier in the DiMeo crime family, which also consists of Johnny Soprano and his brother Junior, Silvio Dante, Paulie Walnuts, Pussy Bonpensiero, and \"Buddha\", Pussy's father. After a black taxi driver is assaulted and robbed by white police officers, riots break out in Newark. Dickie's black associate, Harold McBrayer, kills a looter and is forced to flee to North Carolina to escape criminal charges. Before leaving, he gets $500 (r=-2) from Dickie as a gift.  \nAt a carnival, Tony sees Johnny and Junior arrested for engaging in violence during the riots. Johnny is sentenced to four years in prison for assault with a deadly weapon. During an argument, Hollywood Dick kicks Giuseppina down a flight of stairs. When Dickie finds out, he confronts him. An argument leads to a physical altercation where Dickie kills his father in a fit of rage; he covers up the murder by dumping the body in a warehouse and burning down the building.  \nGuilt-ridden, Dickie visits his father's twin brother, Sally, who is serving a life sentence in prison for killing another made man in his own family. He also begins seeing Giuseppina as his comare. In elementary school, Tony is suspended from school for starting a gambling operation, and Dickie makes Tony pinkie promise him that he will follow the rules.  \nIn early 1972, Johnny is released from prison and Harold returns to Newark determined to form a black criminal family. Giuseppina also has an affair with Harold after fighting with Dickie. Harold kills one of Dickie's men and steals their extortion money. Dickie and his crew torture and question Harold's lieutenant, Cyril, with an impact wrench before shooting him dead. Harold and his gang then engage in a drive-by shootout with Johnny Boy's crew, during which Buddha is killed. Harold and Dickie engage in a standoff, but both leave when they hear police sirens.  \nAfter Tony steals the answers for his geometry exam, the school guidance counselor tells Tony's mother, Livia, that he has a high Stanford–Binet IQ and the Myers–Briggs personality traits of a leader. The counselor also relates how Tony told her about a time in which his mother hugged him and read him a book about Sutter's Mill and how it was one of his best memories. Livia tries to show her affection for Tony, but she mentions how her doctor wanted to prescribe her antidepressants. When Tony suggests taking it, she antagonizes him. At Buddha's wake, Tony asks Dickie if he could get Elavil for his mother, but Dickie is hesitant.  \nAfter the wake, Junior slips and falls on the church steps, causing Dickie to laugh uproariously in his face, infuriating Junior. Dickie reconnects with Giuseppina and promises to finance a beauty parlor for her to run. During a walk on the beach, she confesses to her affair with Harold. An enraged Dickie drowns her in the ocean. Dickie again visits Sally. Sally says that everyone close to Dickie ends up dead sooner or later, and that he should stay out of Tony's life.  \nDickie listens to Sally's advice and begins to avoid Tony, refusing to see him or answer his calls. An upset Tony throws the speakers Dickie gave him out his window. Later that night, Silvio encourages Dickie to reconcile with Tony, and Dickie relents. Before he can arrive home, Dickie is assassinated by an unknown assailant on Junior's orders.  \nAt Dickie's wake, it is revealed that Dickie did acquire the Elavil for Tony and had it in his pocket when he was killed. Tony looks sadly at Dickie's corpse and imagines doing another pinkie promise with him, like the two had done years before. Sometime later, Harold moves into a white neighborhood.  \n## Cast  \nOther notable appearances include Lesli Margherita as Iris Balducci, Kathryn Kates as Angie DeCarlo, Nick Vallelonga as Carmine Cotuso, and Ed Marinaro as Jilly Ruffalo. Robert Vincent Montano and Matteo Russo play Artie Bucco at varying ages, Chase Vacnin portrays the teenage Jackie Aprile, Oberon K.A. Adjepong plays Frank Lucas, and Lauren DiMario plays the teenage Carmela De Angelis, Tony's future wife.  \n## Production  \n### Development  \n<image>David Chase in 2015\nThe origins of what ultimately took shape as The Many Saints of Newark happened when David Chase finished film school, having the idea of making a film about four white persons living around Newark, New Jersey, who joined the National Guard to avoid being drafted to the Vietnam War only to be sent instead to the 1967 Newark riots, though the film went unproduced. Following the release of The Sopranos, it was suggested by Oz creator Tom Fontana that Chase write a film centered on Tony Soprano's father Giovanni \"Johnny Boy\" Soprano set in the 1930s or 1940s. However, the idea eventually fell off due to Chase's lack of interest.  \nChase ruled out the idea of continuing The Sopranos story in June 2017, while simultaneously expressing an interest in a prequel to the series. He had earlier been against the idea of making a film based on The Sopranos, especially a sequel to the series, given James Gandolfini's death in 2013, but became interested in Newark due to the 1967 Newark riots and his family ties to the city: \"I was interested in Newark and life in Newark at that time ... I used to go to down there every Saturday night for dinner with my grandparents. But the thing that interested me most was Tony's boyhood. I was interested in exploring that\", acknowledging that a prequel film could explore the period of Tony's life that he glorified in the show's early episodes.  \nChase said that the main storyline centers on the 1967 Newark riots and racial tensions between the Italian-American and African-American communities. Chase's biggest challenge during writing was the inclusion of many storylines for different characters; some aspects of those storylines were dropped during editing to let the storylines \"take shape\" within the film's overall narrative.  \nIn March 2018, New Line Cinema announced that it purchased the rights to produce the film along with HBO Films, with Chase co-writing the screenplay with Lawrence Konner. New Line's chairman, Toby Emmerich, stated, \"David is a masterful storyteller and we, along with our colleagues at HBO, are thrilled that he has decided to revisit, and enlarge, the Soprano universe in a feature film\". Chase was not concerned about alienating audiences unfamiliar to the show; for him and Konner, their intention was to tell a realistic and respectable dramatic criminal story, under the \"auspices\" of The Sopranos.  \nAlan Taylor, who directed several episodes of The Sopranos, was hired to direct the film in July 2018. Chase offered Taylor to direct the film one day while they lunched together, feeling that Taylor had worked in the show's best episodes and had given him \"the most trouble\". In contrast to the show, Taylor felt that Chase allowed more creative control over the film than when he ran the show, as Chase spent most of the time outlining the story sequestered in the writer's room.\n\n### Casting  \n<image>Alessandro Nivola stars as Dickie Moltisanti\nIn November 2018, Alessandro Nivola was cast to star in the film as Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher Moltisanti. Dickie never appeared in the show despite being mentioned, though Chase did not have any plans to feature the character physically then. In January 2019, while discussing the 20th anniversary of the series, Chase revealed that a young Tony Soprano would appear in the film. Jon Bernthal, Vera Farmiga, Corey Stoll and Billy Magnussen were added to the cast that same month.  \nMichael Gandolfini, son of James Gandolfini, was cast in the role of young Tony. He was not immediately cast and had to audition for the role, but Taylor and Chase felt that they were right in casting him when Gandolfini thanked all the production team for allowing him to \"say hello and goodbye again\" to his father. Gandolfini, having never watched The Sopranos, watched through it to prepare for the role, describing it as an intense process. To keep Gandolfini's performance from being too similar to that of his father, Taylor occasionally reshot a scene if Gandolfini acted like he were already an experienced gangster, as the young Tony is \"still a kid\" during the film.  \nRay Liotta joined the cast in February, with Leslie Odom Jr. and Michela De Rossi joining in March, as well as John Magaro, who starred in Chase's debut feature film Not Fade Away (2012). Liotta had been previously approached by Chase to appear in the third or fourth seasons of The Sopranos, but the plan did not work out.  \nEdie Falco filmed scenes as her character Carmela Soprano which were intended to start the film, but her scenes were cut. Taylor explained, \"There was some confusion as to how best launch the movie. How to start the movie. So we tried a few things and that was one of them. If you've seen the movie you'll see that we begin it in a very different way now but that wasn't always the idea\".\n\n### Filming  \nPrincipal photography began in Brooklyn on April 3, 2019, moved to Newark on May 7, and wrapped up in June 2019, with a $50 million budget. Branford Place, a street in Newark, was transformed to fit the 1960s time period for the riots, including detailed storefronts, the old Adams Theater marquee, and the neon sign for Hobby's Delicatessen. Retired Newark police officer Luther Engler served as a technical adviser for the film.  \nFilming also took place in Bloomfield. Satriale's Pork Store was featured in The Sopranos and was recreated in Paterson. Planned reshoots were halted upon the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the production ultimately returned for reshoots in September 2020, during which the filmmakers shot some important aspects that improved the film's story.  \nThe film uses the 1967 Newark riots as a backdrop for the tensions between the Italian and black communities. To accurately depict the riots, Taylor directly recreated some of the film shots from archival photos and footage of the event.  \nDuring post-production, there were some serious talks about whether the film's depiction of the Newark riots would still seem appropriate in the wake of the George Floyd protests, but Taylor concluded that the film's treatment of the riots would avoid controversy. Christopher Tellefsen worked as the film's editor. The editing process took longer than expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the film industry, though Taylor felt that the extended period helped him and Chase to discuss what the film's final cut would consist of.  \n## Release  \nThe film was initially scheduled to be released on September 25, 2020; however, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on theaters and the film industry, its release date was rescheduled to March 12, 2021. It was then delayed again to September 24, 2021, so it could premiere on the film festival circuit and better position itself as an awards contender, before later moving to October 1.  \nThe film was simultaneously released in theaters and on HBO Max (for a limited period of 31 days), as part of the 2021 Warner Bros. film release schedule plans. The film had its world premiere at the inaugural Tribeca Fall Preview at the Beacon Theatre on September 22, 2021, the same date as the film's early release in the United Kingdom.  \nThe film was released on Blu-ray, 4K Ultra HD and DVD on December 21, 2021. Special features include deleted scenes and two featurettes–\"Making of Newark\" and \"Sopranos Family Honor\". It debuted at the 33rd position for overall disc sales in the United States according to the \"NPD VideoScan First Alert\" chart, and the 18th position in Blu-ray sales. Blu-ray accounted for 60% of sales, with traditional Blu-ray making up 48% of the sales and Ultra HD Blu-ray making up 12%.  \n## Reception  \n### Box office  \nThe Many Saints of Newark grossed $8.2million in the United States and Canada, and $4.8million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $13.1million.  \nIn the United States and Canada, The Many Saints of Newark was released alongside Venom: Let There Be Carnage and The Addams Family 2, and was projected to gross around $10 million from 3,180 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $2.1 million on its first day, and debuted to $5 million, finishing fourth at the box office. Following its less-than-expected opening weekend, Variety wrote that the film \"stands to lose millions\". The film dropped 69% in its second weekend to $1.9 million, finishing fifth.  \n### Streaming viewership  \nThe Many Saints of Newark was a streaming success; according to Samba TV, it was viewed one million times during its opening weekend. It outperformed similarly budgeted films such as Reminiscence and Cry Macho that were released on HBO Max, with WarnerMedia stating that it was streamed three times more than the second-most viewed film of the weekend. The Sopranos also broke HBO Max viewership records around the time of the film's release, attributed to The Many Saints of Newark sparking renewed interest in the series. By the end of its first month, the film had been streamed in more than 2.1 million households in the United States. During its second week of availability on HBO Max, the film was the eighth most-streamed film in the United States, according to TV Time.  \n### Critical response  \nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of score based on count reviews, with an average rating of average. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Even as its storytelling chafes at the edges of its cinematic constraints, The Many Saints of Newark proves The Sopranos allure is still powerful.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it a 77% positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.  \nIn a review for The Boston Globe, Don Aucoin said that \"as a Goodfellas-ish crime drama that vividly evokes time and place, Saints is rendered with enough bare-knuckled verve, unpredictability, and darkly glinting wit to make it work.\" In a positive review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper called the film \"a sharply honed, darkly funny, ultra-violent and wildly entertaining late 1960s period piece\" and an \"immensely satisfying companion piece to The Sopranos\", giving it 3.5 stars out of 4.  \nOwen Gleiberman of Variety called Many Saints \"a sharp, lively, and engrossing movie, one that provides a fascinating running commentary on how the world of The Sopranos came into being\" but noted \"the audience can't help but notice the difference in tone\" when compared to the series. David Fear of Rolling Stone said in his review \"Chase has delivered something that walks the tightrope between social melodrama and fan service, and that sometimes teeters on the edge of falling.\"  \nManohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film \"a busy, unnecessary, disappointingly ordinary origin story\" and said that \"the best thing about The Many Saints of Newark is that it makes you think about The Sopranos, but that's also the worst thing about it.\" Reviewing the film for RogerEbert.com, Glenn Kenny gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars and said:  \n\"The movie's flabbiness, its unfocused flopping from scene to scene, its disinclination to provide any individual scene with any dimension beyond its immediate impact, practically vitiates the entire theme of Dickie's ostensible mentorship of Tony Soprano.\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote: \"The Many Saints of Newark, by contrast, reduces characters of potentially mythic power to a handful of defining traits and pins them to a diorama-like backdrop of historical readymades.\"  \n## Possible sequel  \nChase has expressed interest in producing a sequel to The Many Saints of Newark which follows Tony Soprano in his 20s, provided that he could collaborate with former Sopranos writer Terence Winter. Upon hearing this, Winter replied that he would do it \"in a heartbeat. Absolutely.\"  \nChase revealed that he received an offer from WarnerMedia to produce another season of The Sopranos which bridged the gap between the end of the film and the beginning of the original series, but admitted to The Hollywood Reporter that he was not especially interested in making such a series. However, he noted that he wished to make one more film set in The Sopranos universe because he had an idea of what he might do. \"But I don't think they want that.\"\n\nQuestion: Which individual was cast to star as Dickie Moltisanti in the prequel to The Sopranos?\nChoice list: \nA.

B. Reed was suspected of having a relationship with a white woman and hanged over the Sunflower River Bridge, Clarksdale, Mississippi\nThis article focuses on African Americans who were lynched after World War I. After young African-American men volunteered to fight against the Central Powers, during World War I, many of them returned home but instead of being rewarded for their military service, they were subjected to discrimination and racism by the citizens and the government. Labor shortages in essential industries caused a massive migration of southern African- Americans to northern cities leading to a wide-spread emergency of segregation in the north and the regeneration of the Ku Klux Klan. For many African-American veterans, as well as the majority of the African-Americans in the United States, the times which followed the war were fraught with challenges similar to those they faced overseas. Discrimination and segregation were at the forefront of everyday life, but most prevalent in schools, public revenues, and housing. Although members of different races who had fought in World War I believed that military service was a price which was worth paying in exchange for equal citizenship, this was not the case for African Americans. The decades which followed World War I included blatant acts of racism and nationally recognized events which conveyed American society's portrayal of African-Americans as 2nd class citizens. Although the United States had just won The Great War  in 1918, the national fight for equal rights was just beginning.\n\n## Background  \n### World War I  \nWorld War I began with the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914 and it ended with the signing of the Armistice of November 11, 1918. Though the fighting stopped, the war's potential to resume still existed and peace was only reached when representatives of Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany after Germany resumed its submarine attacks on merchant and passenger ships. When the United States sent men to the fronts of Europe, the United States Armed Forces remained segregated, with all-black and all-white units. Despite the segregation and the mistreatment which they were constantly being subjected to by everyday society, many African Americans volunteered to join the Allied war effort. By the time of the signing of the armistice with Germany, more than 350,000 African Americans had joined the military and served with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front. Around 50,000 of those 350,000 experienced combat and a total of 770 African-Americans who fought for their country paid with their lives. On top of that, during the course of World War 1, over 400,000 black citizens who were searching for defense jobs migrated from the rural south to the urban north in order to fill the need for laborers which existed in essential industries. Although this provided new opportunities for many African American, it would go on to encourage widespread segregation and discrimination in the north after the war was over.  \n### Reaction to returning veterans  \nHistorically, when a war is over, those who served are lauded for their heroism and patriotism. However, that has not always been the case for American soldiers of African descent. African American soldiers who served in World War 1 were treated worse before, during, and after the war than any other group of American soldiers.  \nDuring a homecoming celebration for African-American veterans of World War I in Norfolk, Virginia a race riot broke out on July 21, 1919. At least two people were killed and three others were injured. City officials had to call in the Marines and Navy personnel to restore order.  \nOn August 16, 1917, Senator James K. Vardaman of Mississippi spoke of his fear of black veterans returning to the South, as he viewed that it would \"inevitably lead to disaster.\" To the American South, the use of black soldiers in the military was a threat, not a virtue. \"Impress the negro with the fact that he is defending the flag, inflate his untutored soul with military airs, teach him that it is his duty to keep the emblem of the Nation flying triumphantly in the air,\" and, the senator cautioned, \"it is but a short step to the conclusion that his political rights must be respected.\"  \nOften violence broke out between serving members of the military. In both the Bisbee Riot (July 3, 1919) and the New London riots of 1919 active African-American service members were attacked by white mobs or white military units.  \nMany black soldiers in the years after the war were threatened with violence if they were caught wearing their uniform. Many others were even physically attacked, sometimes barely escaping with their lives. During an April 5, 1919, market day in Sylvester, Georgia, black veteran Daniel Mack was walking through a busy street and brushed against a white man. The white man was offended that Mack did not show the proper amount of respect and the two got in a scuffle; police came on the scene and promptly arrested Mack for assault. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison. A few days into his sentence, on April 14, a white mob broke into the prison, took him out into the wilderness and lynched Mack; he survived by playing dead. No arrests were ever made. Elisha Harper, 25 years old, was the son of the Rev. T. F. Harper, a respectable and \"well-behaved preacher\" living in Helena. He fought in the army during World War I and just returned from Europe. On July 24, 1919, while walking the streets of Newberry, South Carolina, he allegedly insulted a 14-year-old girl, who promptly reported him to the authorities. Harper was arrested and thrown in jail. Soon a white mob had gathered and would have lynched Harper if it was not for the local Sheriff who hid him away.  \nMilitary service provided by African-Americans overseas and at home made little difference in citizenship for African-Americans. American society still perceived African Americans the same after the war as they did before the war.  \n## Lynched African-American veterans  \nThe following is an incomplete list of African Americans who had served in the military during WWI and were killed by white mobs with no trials for alleged crimes. Lynching is embedded deep in America's racial psyche. By 1919, lynching had developed into a programmatic ritual of torture and empowerment to the white race. The accurate number of African American veterans lynched in military uniform is unknown, but there were several cases of beatings and lynchings for the refusal to remove a military uniform, most notably the lynching of Wilbur Little in the spring of 1919. Apparent from the table, the vast majority of lynchings took place in the southeast region of the United States. The three states with the largest number of African American lynchings from 1850 - 1929 were Georgia, Mississippi and Texas.  \n## Contrast to White Veterans  \nThe return home was not perfect for any one group of people leading to the development of the Bonus Armys and many other displays of displeasement. A majority of World War I veterans believed that they had not been compensated enough for their service and they should have been taken better care of, especially in hospitals. However, there was still a major contrast in the treatment received from white and black veterans after World War 1, leading to public unrest and loss of life.  \nWhite veterans received far more recognition from a national level for their bravery and sacrifice in the war. This included radio appearances, national headlines, and statues honoring their sacrifice. The population of the United states in 1919 was over 85% white and almost all major media organizations were run by white males leading to a disparity in the media attention for the entire African-American population. A monopolized media industry and racial prejudice from white Americans led to the unwillingness to consistently recognize the efforts and sacrifices of African-American veterans. In fact, out of the nearly 400,000 African Americans who served in World War I not one was rewarded with the Congressional Medal of Honor until 1991.  \nWhen veterans came back home, there were various victory parades thrown in their honor in major cities. However, because segregation was still in place there were separate parades thrown for African-American soldiers at a smaller scale. During these parades there would be several examples of civil unrest, most notable during a victory parade in Norfolk, Virginia a race riot broke out on July 21, 1919. It was not just notoriety and praise that African-American veterans were lacking. The greatest gap between white and black veterans could be seen when examining financial stability and socioeconomic status. On average, white Americans had far more resources and privileges to live at a higher quality of life.  \n## Aftermath  \nThese lynchings were among several incidents of civil unrest that are now known as the American Red Summer of 1919. Attacks on black communities and white oppression spread to more than three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine massacre in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 blacks and 5 whites were killed. Other major events of Red Summer were the Chicago race riot and Washington D.C. race riot, which caused 38 and 39 deaths, respectively. Both riots had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.  \nAfrican-Americans were not only plagued with racism upon return but the rising flu pandemic of 1918 as well. Due to the statically lower socioeconomic status held by many African-Americans they were more likely to contract the flu and once contracted they were worse off fighting it. Therefore, the flu pandemic devastated the African- American community and left their overall health and financial well being in shambles. This would then cause African American World War 1 veterans to communicate directly with policymakers and bureaucrats to push professional and public health advancement in the 1920s and 1930s for all black Americans.  \nPrior to World War I, most African Americans did not challenge the racial status quo. However, these events and unequal treatment following World War I did lead to a spark in the African American community. Following the war, emboldened by their military service and their support of the war at home through defense jobs, African Americans were determined to fight for equality. Racism and segregation are issues which plagued the African-American community for too long and they were now willing to fight against it. In fact, during the war the African American community hosted protests against segregation and discrimination, but lacked the ignition to cause real change. This change would be called the \"New Negro Movement\" and could be described as the radical political movement toward civil rights following World War I. Emphasized in W. E. B. Du Bois's May 1919 Crisis editorial, \"Returning Soldiers,\" in which he famously proclaimed, \"We return. We return from fighting. We return fighting.\". The combination of the New Negro Movement and the Harlem Renaissance allowed African American intellectuals to secure social equality through literature. This allowed major groups, such as the NAACP, to lobby for bills which pursued equality for African Americans. Most notable was the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, intended to prevent lynchings in the United States, but did not pass.  \nAlthough, post World War 1 could be defined as the spark that initiated the fight against the status quo and the emergence of the New Negro Movement. The fight for equality and civil rights in the United States would become a centuries-long battle which is still taking place today. Due to this reason, similar racial violence and lynchings occurred again after African-American troops returned from service in World War 2 and African American veterans of the Cold War\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts soldiers who were awarded the Croix de guerre for their gallantry in action during World War I?\nChoice list: \nA.

Most commercial trailers have built-in ramps for loading and off-loading cars, as well as power hydraulics to raise and lower ramps for stand-alone accessibility.\n\n## Small car trailers  \n## Commercial car carrier trailers  \n<image>Some of the hydraulic ramp controls on a car carrier trailer.\nLoading a trailer  \nChinese car transporter. Notice the long length and the double-parked upper deck of cars.  \nCommercial-size car carrying trailers are commonly used to ship new cars from the manufacturer to auto dealerships. In the United  States, shipping of used vehicles is also a big industry, employed by car owners who are relocating and choose to ship their cars instead of driving, as well as consumers who have just purchased a vehicle on the second-hand market (particularly online) and need it delivered to their location.  \nLike other semi-trailers, most commercial car carrier trailers attach to the tractor using a fifth wheel coupling. Trailers can either be enclosed, possessing walls like a conventional box trailer, which affords the shipped vehicles more protection at the cost of lower capacity; or open, as in the commonly seen skeletal tube steel design, which exposes the vehicles to the elements but allows for greater carrying capacity. An American commercial car carrier typically fits between 5 and 9 cars,  \ndepending on the car size and trailer model (capacity is limited by an 80,000 lb weight cap that a road vehicle is subject to under U.S. law.). Significantly higher-capacity vehicles have been observed around the world, such as a side-by-side loading Chinese model.  \nOpen commercial car carrier trailers typically have a double-decker design, with both decks subdivided into a number of loading and storage ramps that can be tilted and lifted independently of one another with hydraulics. Unlike flatbed tow trucks, which often need to transport non-running vehicles, car carrier trailers are not equipped with loaders or winches, instead, relying on the vehicles to be loaded under their own power. The trailer hydraulics allow the ramps to be aligned on a slope, so cars can be driven up and secured to the ramp floor with chains, tie-down ratchets, or wheel straps, after which the ramp can be tilted in any direction to optimize stacking.  \nTo load vehicles on the top deck of a double-decker commercial trailer, the rear half of the deck can tilt and be lowered hydraulically, forming a drive-up ramp to the upper deck. The top deck is usually loaded first and off-loaded last since the presence of cars on the lower deck can make it impossible to lower the top deck ramp.  \nTrailer hydraulics are operated using a control box mounted on the trailer itself.\n\n## Other equipment  \nIn order to further expand storage capacity, some trucks, typically called stinger units, are equipped with an \"overhead\" — an extra storage space mounted above the truck cabin which is accessible via the top ramp of a car carrier trailer. Up to 3 vehicles can be loaded on the truck: one on the roof, and two over the 5th wheel/drive tires.\n\nQuestion: Which component is essential for the operation of a car carrier trailer as described in the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)  \nThe Crucifix by Cimabue at Santa Croce (1265) is a very large wooden crucifix, painted in distemper, attributed to the Florentine painter and mosaicist Cimabue, one of two large crucifixes attributed to him. The work was commissioned by the Franciscan friars of Santa Croce and is built from a complex arrangement of five main and eight ancillary timber boards. It is one of the first Italian artworks to break from the late medieval Byzantine style and is renowned for its technical innovations and humanistic iconography.  \nThe gilding and monumentality of the cross link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is reflective of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes are closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Velázquez to Francis Bacon.  \nThe work has been in the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence since the late thirteenth century, and at the Museo dell'Opera Santa Croce since restoration following flooding of the Arno in 1966. It remains in poor condition despite conservation efforts.  \n## Commission  \nBoth of Cimabue's surviving crucifixes were commissioned by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views had a profound effect on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.  \nThe church at Santa Croce was the third that the Franciscans constructed at the site. The first was begun in 1295, and is where Cimabue's Crucifix probably hung, given its large size, above the rood screen. It was later positioned at the north transept, in the sacristy and by the entrance on the southern flank.  \n## Description  \nCimabue achieves a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches tended to be extremely colourful, with frescoed walls, painted capitals, and gold leaf paintings. Pale tonalities dominate, with the main contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features of his face stand out more, and position his head as the focal point.  \n### Crucifixion  \n<image>Cimabue's Arezzo crucifix, c. 1268–1271. This is the earlier of the two extant crucifixes attributed to him.\nCompared to earlier works of this type, Christ's body is more physically corporeal, depicted as a real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both his body and semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above the level of the cross.  \nHis body arches, forcing his torso to raise against the cross. Blood pours from the wounds in his hands as his head falls to the side from fatigue and the physical reality of approaching death. His body is naked except for a sheer and transparent loincloth that only just covers his thighs and buttocks. The choice of a white, veil-like loincloth, dramatically more modest than the red garment in the Arezzo work, may be influenced by earlier crucifixions by Giunta Pisano. His nakedness highlights his vulnerability and suffering. It seems influenced by a thirteenth-century Franciscan Meditation on Christ that emphasised pathos and human interest in the suffering of the Passion; \"Turn your eyes away from His divinity for a little while and consider Him purely as a man\".\n<image>Giunta Pisano, Crucifix, tempera on wood, 1240s. Papal Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels in Assisi\nHis eyes are open, and his skin is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or timeless sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, was known as the Christus triumphans (\"Triumphant Christ\"), and for contemporary – especially Franciscan – taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens (\"Suffering Christ\") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.  \nThe work surpasses Cimabue's c. 1268 Arezzo crucifix in several ways. It is more human and less reliant on idealised facial types, and the anatomy is more convincing. Christ's face is longer and narrower, and his nose less idealised. These features, according to art historian Robert Gibbs, give him \"a coarser but more personal expression\". A similar approach is taken with the cloth in the background of the cross itself, which although highly ornamented, lacks the lavish ornamentation of the equivalent cloth in the Arezzo cross.  \nHis head hangs in exhaustion, and his hands bleed from the puncture wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher above his head and strain to carry the weight of his body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.  \nThe painting contains elements typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions. But in other respects it conforms to the then strict iconography of the thirteenth century. Typical of depictions of the crucified Christ of this era, with his outstretched arms he is as wide as he is long, conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions.\n\n### Saints  \nRepresentations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ in small rectangular panels at either end of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.  \nTheir cloaks are simpler and lack the lavish gilding of the Arezzo crucifixion. The Virgin wears a red dress. Her robe was originally blue, but has darkened.  \n## Carpentry  \nThe crucifix measures 448 cm x 390 cm and consists of five basic physical components; a vertical board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as aprons adjacent to the central board. There are another eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure is reinforced by two full length vertical battens. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork.  \nIts dimensions are highly symmetrical and proportionate, probably influenced by the geometric ideals, ratios and rules of design of the ancient Greeks. The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and dynamic rectangles. Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate the sway of Christ's body, altered the positioning of some of the boards on the lower half.  \n## Attribution  \nDue to lack of surviving documentation, it is difficult to attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.  \nRejecting these views, Joseph Archer Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle in 1903 concluded that the Santa Croce crucifix \"in technical examination...makes some approach to the Florentine master, but it is rather of its time than by the master himself.\"  \n## 1966 damage and restoration  \nThe present state of the Crucifix, after flood damage and restoration.  \nThe crucifix was installed in the church of Santa Croce at the end of the thirteenth century. The church flooded in 1333 and 1557, but only experienced serious flood damage in 1966 when the banks of the Arno river burst and flooded Florence. During the event thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed and the Crucifix lost 60% of its paint. By 1966 it was returned to display at the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it had been located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and naphtha on the wood frame, which further swelled from soakage, forcing the panel to expand and bend, cracking the paint-work.  \nRescuing the cross from the flood of 1966  \nA team of restorers led by conservators Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza at the \"Laboratario del Restauro\" in Florence spent ten years reapplying paint. Utilising computer modelling, they worked in an almost pointillist manner. The tiny specks of pigment floating around the piece were recovered with pliers by staff wading in the water after the torrents had subsided. The wooden frame had significantly weakened, and it was necessary to separate it from both the gesso and canvas to prevent buckling as the reapplied paint dried. The Crucifix was put back on public display in 1976. The restoration was covered by the international press.  \nSince restoration the work has been lent to galleries outside Italy, the first time it had left Florence since its creation. According to the critic Waldemar Januszczak, it was brought \"around the globe in a curious, post-restoration state—part original artwork, part masterpiece of modern science... a thirteenth century—twentieth-century hybrid.\"\n\nQuestion: Which crucifix painting represents the \"Christus triumphans\" style, characterized by an unblemished skin and open eyes, reflecting a less humanized and more divine portrayal of Christ?\nChoice list: \nA.

Purnell  \nRear Admiral William Reynolds Purnell (6 September 1886 – 3 March 1955) was an officer in the United States Navy who served in World War I and World War II. A 1908 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he captained destroyers during World War I. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his role in protecting convoys against German submarines as commander of the  6.  \nHe was promoted to rear admiral in November 1941. During World War II, he was chief of staff of the ill-fated Asiatic Fleet at the start of the Pacific War. He later served as Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Materiel. He was the navy representative on the Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment, and, from September 1942, the navy representative on the Military Policy Committee, the three-man committee that oversaw the Manhattan Project.  Purnell helped coordinate its activities with those of the navy. In 1945, he travelled to Tinian as the representative of the Military Policy Committee, and coordinated preparations for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with senior army and navy commanders in the Pacific. He retired from the navy in 1946 and died in 1955.  \n## Early life  \nWilliam Reynolds Purnell was born in Bowling Green, Missouri, on 6 September 1886. In 1908, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was commissioned as an ensign in 1910. During World War I, he commanded the destroyers 6, 6, 6, and 6. For his services, he was awarded the Navy Cross. His citation read:  \nIn January 1917, while he was serving on the Rowan, he married Ada Dodge Curtiss, the daughter of Walter Phelps Dodge and the ex-wife of Gerald S. Curtiss. They had one son, William Reynolds Purnell, Jr.  \nAfter the war, he commanded the tanker 6 from 1934 to 1936. Alternating duty afloat with service ashore, he then became secretary to the General Board. He commanded the cruiser 6 from January to December 1939.  \n## World War II  \nPurnell became Chief of Staff of Admiral Thomas C. Hart's Asiatic Fleet. Purnell represented the United States at a planning conference in Singapore in April 1941 at which American, British, Dutch, Australian, and New Zealand commanders attempted to coordinate their plans for an increasingly likely war with Japan. He was promoted to rear admiral in November 1941. On 7 December, Purnell played golf with Hart. War broke out the next morning. The Japanese advanced quickly and the Asiatic Fleet moved from the Philippines to Java in January. As the Japanese closed in on Java, Purnell flew to Broome on 25 February.  \nIn Australia, Purnell became chief of staff to Vice Admiral William A. Glassford, the commander of US Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific. When Glassford departed in May 1942, Purnell took his place. He too left Australia in June 1942, for duty in Washington, D.C., in the Office of the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest J. King. For his services, he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. His citation read:The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Rear Admiral William Reynolds Purnell, United States Navy, for especially meritorious service as Chief of Staff to Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, and Commander U.S. Forces, Southwest, Pacific, since the outbreak of war for duties involving great responsibility connected with formulation plans, counseling their application and aid in directing execution, especially of offensive missions of forces of this command which have resulted in substantial damage to the enemy together with skill and tact displayed in negotiating, conferring and dealing with commanders of the Allied Forces during World War II.  \n<image>The \"Tinian Joint Chiefs\": Captain William S. Parsons (left), Rear Admiral William R. Purnell (center), and Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell (right)\nPurnell became Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Materiel. He was also the navy representative on the Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment, and, from September 1942, the navy representative on the Military Policy Committee, the three-man committee that oversaw the Manhattan Project. Purnell helped coordinate the activities of the Manhattan Project with those of the navy, particularly the navy's thermal diffusion research, and he helped provide scientists and technicians from the navy for the project.  \nIn February 1945, Purnell arranged for Commander Frederick Ashworth to go to Guam to brief Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz on the project. He provided Ashworth with a letter from King stressing the project's importance and the need for secrecy. Ashworth selected a base site for the Manhattan Project's operations. He inspected facilities on Guam and Tinian, and chose the latter.  \nTinian's harbor suffered from congestion due to extensive base development work, and ships sometimes took months to unload. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., went to Purnell, who arranged for an order from King to Nimitz stating that all shipments related to the Manhattan Project and the 509th Composite Group had to be unloaded immediately on arrival, regardless of the consequent disruption to the port's operations.\n<image>Purnell (center), General Carl Spaatz (second from right) and other dignitaries await the return of the Enola Gay and her crew from the mission to Hiroshima\nProblems like this underlined the value of having high-ranking officers on hand to deal with local commanders to make decisions on the spot if necessary. In drawing up an organization for command of the Manhattan Project's operations, Groves and Purnell agreed that Purnell should to be present on Tinian as both the representative of the Military Policy Committee and the personal representative of Admiral King. He was joined by Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, the Manhattan Project's Deputy for Operations, and the two shared responsibility for coordinating the Manhattan Project's activities with the senior army and navy commanders in the Pacific. Along with Captain William S. Parsons, the director of Project Alberta, they formed what became informally known as the \"Tinian Joint Chiefs\".  \nPurnell was the first proponent of the idea that two atomic attacks, one following quickly after the other, would be required to end the war. This was something that Groves and Purnell discussed a number of times. \"I knew that with him and Farrell on the ground at Tinian,\" Groves wrote. \"There would be no unnecessary delay in exploiting our success\" after the bombing of Hiroshima. The main difficulty with the second mission, then scheduled for 11 August, was the weather, which was predicted to be good until 9 August but bad for at least five days starting on 10 August. Parsons agreed to work the assembly team around the clock to get the Fat Man bomb ready by the evening of 8 August.  \nBefore Major Charles Sweeney took off on the mission, Purnell took him aside and asked him if he knew how much the bomb cost. Sweeney did not know; Purnell told him it was about $2 billion. He then asked if Sweeney knew how much his aircraft was worth. This Sweeney did know; over half a million dollars. Purnell then told him: \"I'd suggest you keep those relative values in mind for this mission.\"\n\n## Later life  \nAfter the war, Purnell served as a member of the Army-Navy Evaluation Board during Operation Crossroads. He retired from the navy in October 1946, and moved to Palo Alto, California, where he died on 5 March 1955. He was buried in Golden Gate National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Ada Dodge Purnell, and his son, William R.

The bezantée bordure indicates a connection to the ancient Earls of Cornwall\nSir William Killigrew (died 1622) of Hanworth, Middlesex, was a courtier to Queen Elizabeth I and to her successor King James I, whom he served as Groom of the Privy Chamber. He served as a member of parliament at various times between 1571 and 1614 and was Chamberlain of the Exchequer between 1605 and 1608. Several of his descendants were also royal courtiers and many were buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\n## Origins  \nKilligrew was the fifth son of John III Killigrew (died 1567) of Arwenack, Cornwall, the first Governor of Pendennis Castle, situated on land within the Arwenack estate, appointed by King Henry VIII. His mother was Elizabeth Trewinnard, 2nd daughter of James Trewennard of Trewennard, in the parish of St Erth, Cornwall. The monumental brass of John III Killigrew survives in St Budock's Church, near Arwenack.  \n## Career  \n### Under Queen Elizabeth I  \nIn 1571 he was elected Member of Parliament for Grantham in Lincolnshire and in 1572 he was elected MP for Helston in Cornwall. He became feodary and escheator for the Duchy of Cornwall and Constable of Launceston Castle in 1576 by which year he was Groom of the Privy Chamber to Queen Elizabeth I. In 1578 he was farmer of the profits from seals in the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Common Pleas. He was commissioner for musters for Cornwall by 1582 and was a Justice of the Peace for Cornwall from 1583 to 1587. In 1584 he was elected MP for the Killigrew pocket borough of Penryn. He was receiver for Devon and Cornwall by 1588 and was commissioner for goods from Madre de Dios in 1592. In 1593 he was elected MP for Fowey in Cornwall. He was commissioner acting treasurer of the chamber in 1595 and commissioner for goods from Cadiz in 1596. In 1597 he was elected MP for the prestigious county seat, Cornwall.  \n### Under King James I  \nHe was knighted in 1603 on the succession of King James I. In 1604 he became MP for Liskeard. From 1605 to 1608 he was Chamberlain of the Exchequer. In 1614 he was elected MP for Penryn again.  \n## Marriage and progeny  \nAt some time about 1576 Killigrew married Margaret Saunders, daughter of Thomas Saunders of Uxbridge, Middlesex, and widow of Robert Woolman and of John Leigh. By his wife he had the following progeny:  \n<image>Catherine Killigrew (born 1579) (Lady Jermyn), at age 35, daughter of Sir William Killigrew and wife of Sir Thomas Jermyn (died 1645). 1614 Portrait by\nMarcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1561–1636), Yale Center for British Art, Connecticut  \n* Sir Robert Killigrew (1580–1633) of Hanworth, Middlesex, MP and Vice-Chamberlain to Queen Henrietta Maria.  \n* Elizabeth Killigrew, eldest daughter, wife of Sir Maurice Berkeley (c. 1577–1617), MP, of Bruton Abbey, Somerset.  \n* Catherine Killigrew (born 1579), wife of Sir Thomas Jermyn (died 1645) of Suffolk, MP, and mother of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of Saint Albans, KG, (1605–1684).

Also on May 5, 1979, in Dothan, Alabama, they had an arm wrestling match that ended in a no contest when Hogan overturned the table and his manager, Billy Spears, interfered.  \nHogan joined the World Wrestling Federation in 1979, after two years of competing for smaller, regional promotions. Andre was at the time a six-year WWF veteran who also toured the regional circuit and Japan.  \nTheir first WWF encounters came in the spring of 1980, when André competed as a face and Hogan as a heel. The two met 16 times throughout the year with André victorious in most of their matches; several matches, however, ended with both wrestlers being counted out. At Shea Stadium during Showdown at Shea, as well as a month later in Hamburg, Pennsylvania, Hogan body slammed André but ended up losing by pinfall, even though Hogan clearly kicked out before the three-count was made. During a television taping at Hamburg, Pennsylvania, Hogan and manager Fred Blassie confronted André as he was being interviewed and challenged him to a match, to which André accepted. During the match (aired the following week), Hogan again successfully body slammed André but André gained the upper hand. Hogan then loaded his elbow pad with a pair of brass knuckles and struck him in the forehead, causing André to bleed; Hogan fled the ring before André yelled for him to come back. The two met several more times during 1980, with Hogan body slamming André in most of their matches before André would rally for a win, often by pinfall.  \nThroughout 1982 and 1983 while both were working in New Japan Pro-Wrestling the two had several additional matches, though during these matches André was the heel and Hogan was the face.  \n### 1982–1986: As friends  \nHogan left the WWF in 1981 and, after filming scenes for the movie Rocky III began competing for a rival company, the American Wrestling Association, or AWA, for which Andre also competed on occasion.  \nBobby “The Brain” Heenan, a heel manager whose protégés included AWA World champion Nick Bockwinkel, immediately saw Hogan and Andre as threats to Bockwinkel's title and began targeting both of them. Hogan and Andre became allies, and from 1981 to 1983, often competed as tag team partners, facing Bockwinkel, Heenan and other members of the Heenan Family. The Hogan-Andre tag team won most of these matches, often by disqualification.  \nThe friendship continued into 1984, when Hogan returned to the WWF. On the night that Hogan won the WWF World Heavyweight championship from the Iron Sheik, Andre was among the wrestlers who congratulated Hogan during a post-match celebration. The two teamed later in 1984 in a handicap match during an event at the Brendan Byrne Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, defeating Big John Studd and then-WWF Tag Team Champions Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch. Heenan joined the WWF in 1984 and again targeted Hogan and Andre. During the next two years, Andre and Hogan teamed against several Heenan family pairings, most notably Studd and King Kong Bundy (with Heenan joining them on occasion). As was the case in AWA, the Hogan-Andre team almost always came out the winners.  \nThe friendship of Hogan and Andre played a crucial factor in the events leading up to their 1987-1988 feud.  \n### Build to WrestleMania III (1987)  \n<image>alt=Bobby Heenan (front), a Caucasian man in a black sequin jacket, leads André the Giant to the ring\nAfter a leave of absence and a stint as competing as part of The Machines tag team stable, André returned to the WWF. The WWF began advertising André, once again as a face, as an opponent of either Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage, or as a tag-team partner of Hogan to face Savage and The Honky Tonk Man. However, Rick Steamboat competed instead in André's place, with no official explanation given for André's absence. André did make an appearance at a televised show at Madison Square Garden, getting into the ring after Hogan had won a match; André simply picked up the WWF World Heavyweight Championship belt, looked at it, and gave it back to a bewildered Hogan before leaving ringside. Announcers Gorilla Monsoon and Gene Okerlund thought André's unannounced appearance was strange but didn't think anything more of it.  \nThings began happening on an edition of Piper's Pit in 1987. First, Hogan was presented a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three years; André came out to congratulate him, but later Hogan remarked how André's handshake felt a little too firm. On the following week's Piper's Pit, André was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being \"the only undefeated wrestler in wrestling history.\"  WWF billed him as having been undefeated for 15 years, despite having lost several matches via countout and disqualification. Hogan came out to congratulate André but spoke mostly of himself, causing André to walk out in the midst of Hogan's speech. A meeting between André and Hogan was scheduled to take place the next week on Piper's Pit (February 7, 1987).  \nWhen André came out he was accompanied by Bobby Heenan. Heenan accused Hogan of being André's friend only so he would not have to defend the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against him. Hogan disputed this, but André challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania III. Heenan, following Hogan's apparent disbelief, stated \"You can't believe it, maybe you'll believe this, Hogan\" followed by André ripping off Hogan's shirt and crucifix, with the crucifix causing Hogan's chest to bleed.  \nOn a “Piper’s Pit” segment aired a week later, Hogan reflected on his friendship with Andre and how he felt betrayed when he was now with Heenan. Piper asked Hogan point-blank whether he would face Andre at WrestleMania, to which Hogan responded with an emphatic “YES!” The friendship angle continued to be emphasized at a contract signing (aired several weeks later), where Hogan angrily accused Andre of betraying their friendship; Heenan pressed on with his claims that Hogan used their friendship to duck a title match, while Andre claimed he purposely held back on some of his teachings to Hogan before predicting victory.  \nDuring the March 14 (taped February 21) edition of Saturday Night's Main Event X at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, both were participants in a 20-man Battle royal. Although neither won, André stated he gained a psychological advantage over Hogan, due to eliminating him from the contest. André also was billed as a corner man for several of Hogan's opponents, almost always members of the Heenan Family, at a few untelevised house shows prior to WrestleMania III.  \nAt WrestleMania III, André's was billed at abbr=on, and the stress of such immense weight on his bones and joints resulted in constant pain, causing him to wear a brace underneath his wrestling singlet. Hogan won the match after body-slamming André (later dubbed \"the bodyslam heard around the world\"), followed by Hogan's running leg drop finisher. This was billed as the first time Hogan slammed André, despite having done it multiple times in 1980. André had also been slammed previously by Harley Race, El Canek and Stan Hansen, among others.  \nFollowing the match, André took a leave of absence while Hogan concentrated on title defenses against Race, Hercules, Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage, the One Man Gang and Killer Khan, among others.\n\n### Feud continued (1987–1988)  \nIn May 1987, on Saturday Night's Main Event XI, Heenan and Andre gave an interview with Gene Okerlund.  During the interview Heenan and Andre claimed – by virtue of a bodyslam attempt by Hogan about a minute into the match, wherein Andre fell on top and (by Heenan's claim) the referee completed the three count – they were cheated by the referee and that Andre was the rightful champion and still undefeated.  Heenan demanded an investigation and a subsequent rematch if the WWF wouldn't strip Hogan of the championship.  \nAt the inaugural Survivor Series event André and Hogan were named as captains of their respective teams. After earlier confronting each other in the ring early in the match, the two finally met midway through the match, battling for approximately one minute with Hogan dominating André; however, just as Hogan was about to knock André from the ring, heel wrestlers King Kong Bundy and the One Man Gang interfered from outside the ring and caused Hogan to be counted out. André went on to be the sole survivor of the match, pinning Bam Bam Bigelow. After the match Hogan returned to the ring and attacked André, knocking him out of the ring.  \nHogan defended his title against Bundy on Saturday Night's Main Event XIII.  Andre was in Bundy's corner and interfered in the match.  \nThe referee stopped the match and ejected Andre from ringside.  Andre was irate but obliged with the request in order to prevent Bundy from being disqualified.  Bundy would go on to win the match via a count-out and demanded a rematch with Andre in his corner.  \nAfter Hogan won a rematch against Bundy on Saturday Night's Main Event XIV which aired January 2, 1988 (taped December 7, 1987), André snuck up to get revenge on Hogan, choking him from behind until he was virtually unconscious, not letting go even after seven face-aligned wrestlers came to the ring to try to pull Andre away; it was only after Hacksaw Jim Duggan broke a 2x4 over André's back (which Andre no-sold) that gave the faces the opening they needed to pull Hogan to safety.  \nIn the meantime, Hogan was busy defending his title against the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase, which started when Hogan refused to sell the title to DiBiase. Hogan won every one of their matchups (often by disqualification), and a frustrated DiBiase turned to André to win the title for him. This, plus the Survivor Series match and Andre's attack of Hogan, were the pieces used to create interest in a Hogan-André rematch, set for The Main Event I, which aired live on February 5, 1988, on NBC. An in-ring contract signing was staged at the first Royal Rumble, aired January 24, 1988, where DiBiase promoted André to \"give your stamp of approval\" by grabbing Hogan, slamming his head into the table and then tipping the table on top of him before leaving the ring. The next evening, at a televised house show at Madison Square Garden, André was the cornerman for DiBiase and his bodyguard, Virgil, in the latter two wrestlers' tag-team match against Hogan and Bam Bam Bigelow; despite multiple times where André interfered, Hogan and Bigelow rallied for the win.  \n#### Hogan vs. Andre II (The Main Event)  \nAt The Main Event, André won the match and WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan, even though Hogan's shoulders were not on the mat during the entire three-count; the referee was distracted by Virgil during Hogan's pinfall attempt of André immediately before, setting up the finish.  Immediately after winning, whilst still inside the ring and interviewed by Gene Okerlund, André publicly contractually surrendered the title to DiBiase, however the transaction was subsequently declared invalid by then-WWF president Jack Tunney and the title was declared vacant. The broadcast was seen by 33 million people.  \n(Following the match it was revealed that appointed referee Dave Hebner was \"detained backstage\", and Hogan during his post match interview accused DiBiase of paying someone to get plastic surgery to look like Dave. It was revealed to have been Dave's twin brother, Earl Hebner.)  \n#### Hogan vs. Andre III (WrestleMania IV)  \nA 14-wrestler tournament was set up WrestleMania IV, for the winner to claim the vacant WWF World Championship; as part of the tournament, Hogan and André were given first-round byes and would automatically wrestle in the quarter-finals. In the meantime, Hogan and André battled on opposing sides of tag-team matchups, Hogan often paired with either Bigelow or Hacksaw Jim Duggan and André with DiBiase, with Hogan's team always victorious.  \nAt WrestleMania, André and Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match. In the end, Hogan's friend \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage won the title, defeating DiBiase in the finals. The Hogan-André feud then simmered when Hogan took a leave of absence during the spring and early summer of 1988 (to film the movie No Holds Barred) while André feuded with Duggan.  \n#### Wind down of feud  \nInterest in a possible resumption of the feud came in the summer of 1988 when Savage began issuing an open challenge for the WWF World Championship, leading to a two-on-one attack by André and DiBiase. Savage recovered and the next week declared he and Hogan would face André and DiBiase at the inaugural SummerSlam pay-per-view held at Madison Square Garden.  \n<image>Hulk Hogan pictured in March 7, 1989 at the El Paso Civic Center for a WWF \"Superstars of Wrestling\" event. (He would fight Big Boss Man this night while André the Giant faced Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts.)\nAndré and Hogan fought in a steel cage match held at WrestleFest on July 31, 1988, in Milwaukee, which Hogan won (after knocking André from the cage and causing him to be tied in the ring ropes). In the main event match at SummerSlam, André and DiBiase (calling themselves The Mega Bucks) seemed to have a psychological advantage over Hogan and Savage (known as The Mega Powers) as the heel-aligned Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was the special guest referee. However, the Mega Powers won, thus ending the Andre-Hogan rivalry. André's next feud would be with Jake Roberts, and Hogan's would be (along with Savage) with the Big Boss Man and Akeem (The Twin Towers).  \nAndre and Hogan met one more time in their careers, that coming in March 1990, shortly before WrestleMania VI when Hogan teamed with the now-face Big Boss Man to defeat Andre and Haku (who were teaming as The Colossal Connection); the Colossal Connection were tag team champions but this was a non-title match.\n\n## Kayfabe  \nIn real life, Andre and Hogan were friends. A picture even exists of Andre attending Hogan's wedding to his first wife, Linda.\n\nQuestion: At WrestleMania III, what iconic wrestling move did Hulk Hogan perform on André the Giant?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# Pandyan art and architecture  \n<image>Vettuvan Koil in Kalugumalai, Pandyan architecture, 8th century CEThe Pandyan empire is believed to have first emerged circa 600 BC and was one of the leading Tamil dynasties of Southern India. There were various forms of art and many architectural communities within the empire, and their work was sold to overseas markets. Rock cutting and structural temples are examples of these, playing a significant role in Pandyan culture. The rock carvings typically depicted religious figures, floral motifs and animals and were made to surround temples and shrines.\nThe vimana, gopuram and mandapa are some of the predominant features of the early Pandyan temples. Groups of small temples are seen at the Tiruchirappalli district of Tamil Nadu. In the later stages of Pandyan rule, finely sculptured idols, gopurams and vimanas were developed. Gopurams are the rectangular entrance and portals of the temples.  \nOther integral art forms of these Pandyan communities were the paintings, poetry, music and punch-marked coins, each with symbols and transcriptions holding meaning to society.\n\n## History  \n<image>Four-armed Vishnu, Pandya Dynasty, 8th–9th century CE.The Pandyan kingdom was one of the three major empires of the Tamil dynasty in Tamil Nadu, India. Pandya, meaning 'big' or'strong', is the oldest of these empires, prevailing for what is estimated to be four to five centuries. Despite some uncertainty around the structure of these Tamil empires, the history becomes clearer after the beginning of the common era. This became a period of extensive travel and trade between these Tamil speaking kingdoms and between Tamil Nadu and other countries. There is mention of the Pandyan kings in both Greek and Roman history which reflects this ancient international trade relationship. Madurai was the capital city of early the Pandyan kingdom and was the heart of notable temple architecture during this period.\n\n\n## Artisan communities  \nThe Pandya's were known for their unique art forms that differed from the other kingdoms of Tamil Nadu. There were various communities each providing different crafts fundamental to Pandyan culture. It is evident that the empire held a significant influence over art across all of Southern India.  \nThe primary artisan groups formed an association referred to as the Kammalar, composed of a goldsmith, brass smith, blacksmith, carpenter and mason. Their work in Pandya was culturally important across all of Tamil Nadu as well as being important to trade in the overseas market.  \nAnother notable example of key artisanal communities in Pandya were the sculptors and stonemasons. The stonemasons carved cave temples made of granite rock, influenced by the head of gods central to their religion. The rock sculptures had a distinctive style that included wide chests and shoulders, and long faces that contrasted the petite hips and soft features. An example of these key stone carvings is seen at the entrance of a cave temple at Pillaiyarpatti. The inscription under the sculpture refers to the carving as ‘Deśivināyagar’, a figure still worshiped in the area today.  \nJewellery was another art form practiced by the craftsmen of Pandya. They used gold, stones and pearls to create various ornaments sold to overseas buyers. The jewellery had images of their gods and symbols that represented their gods engraved into the gold. Pieces from the Pandyan period have been found with floral engravings and inscriptions dedicated to the God Tirumalai Suvadigal on the surface.  \n## Coin styles  \nThe art of coin making in the Pandyan dynasty used punch-marking methods, which was a type of early Indian coinage known for its unique symbols and irregular shapes. They ranged in colours from gold, silver and copper, depending on the political influence of the time. Some of the earliest coins were square shaped and were marked with elephant symbols on one side. In later periods the coins were marked with fish, heraldic symbols, and various emblems. The fish that are seen on Pandyan coins are the same as those notable on the national Pandyan flag, which includes a double fish emblem. Other coin styles depict a Chola influence as they contain a tiger motif, and human figures. The kammatasor were the workers responsible for minting these various coins in the Tamil country.  \n## Paintings  \nMurals of the Sittannavasal Jain Temple, dating back to 7th century CEThe rule of both the Pandya's and the Cholas is referred to as the ‘golden period’ of art and culture in the ancient cities of Tamil Nadu. The paintings of the Pandyan dynasty share similarities to that of Buddhist and Hindu art found in the Brihadeesvara temple. Common motifs seen in Pandyan paintings include animals, royal figures, floral patterns and lotus leaves. Sittannavasal is a Jain temple originating under Pandyan ruling which is home to some of the only Pandyan paintings left in the world. It is famous for its mural paintings covering the walls and roof of the cave. The Sittannavasal paintings contain varied colour schemes, using black pigments from soot, green from Terre verre, red and yellow from ochre and blue from ultramarine. These elaborate colour schemes contrast the typically monochrome, red ochre paintings of other southern Indian dynasties. However, many of these Pandyan paintings in the Sittannavasal temple have been vandalised and are poorly visible in the modern day. Other cave paintings dating to the 9th century include motives of fish, ducks and people dancing.  \n## Poetry and Music  \nThere is evidence of both occupational poets, that recounted on the affairs of the king as a profession as well as those who pursued poetry as a hobby. Sangam poetry, which derived from Pandya, Chola and Chera influence narrated the distinction between love and war and the power of the human experience. Other poetry of the empire reflect a sarcastic and sophisticated take on everyday life in the Pandyan village.  \nAttruppadai is a genre of ancient Indian poetry whereby one minstrel addresses another. Madurai-Kanchi is a poem written in the Attruppadai genre, admiring Nedunchezian, the Pandyan King.  \nMany of the kings themselves, were poets and literacy experts that wrote extensively.  \nMusic attributed to the Pandyan period was derived from the poetry and was created by bands of both male and female singers and dancers. Traditionally these long poems were publicly played to music by thirteen musicians, with a variety of instruments. Professional musicians would also chant the melodic poetry outside temples.  \n## Dance  \nThe Pandya's, along with other dynasties of the Tamil Nadu district also participated in various traditional dances. The Deverattam, translating to the god or king dance in Tamil language, was one particularly performed by the Pandyan dynasty. It was generally danced by the kings and fighters after a successful battle against other Indian dynasties. It was a dance of joy and a symbol of hope for the following battles.  \n## Pandyan architecture  \nThe Pandyan dynasty had their own unique temple style that followed on from the chola style temples between 1000 and 1250 AD. The architectural features of Pandyan temples reflected the kingdoms wealth and social position in respect to other dynasties of southern India at the time. They were mostly stone buildings with distinctive qualities such as rectangular ground floors leading into pyramidal floors higher up with gilded roofs above. Surrounding the temples there were various important Hindu mythological figures sculpted into the rock and various animals carved into the pillars.  \nKey features of Pandyan architecture include the vimanas, mandapas, and the gopuras. The vimana is the structure above and around the main shrine and is the area where the deities are present. The vimana can be single or multi storied, depending on how many deities the temple contains. The mandapa is a pillared hallway or room that ancient Indian dynasties used for religious dancing, music and ceremonies. Larger temples can have more than one mandapa placed to the sides of the main structures. The gopura is another predominant feature of Pandyan architecture and it is the entranceway into the temple. It is a storied structure commonly made of stone, and there can be multiple built around the sides of the temple.  \nDravidian style architecture is commonly seen throughout Pandyan temples and it is a southern Indian architectural style. The predominant features of Dravidian architecture are the main tower, referred to as the vimana, and the entrance gateway referred to as the gopuram. The vimana is notable in Dravidian architecture as it is structured as a tiered pyramid that rises up to the sky. This is different to the main tower structures in northern India, which curve up to a point.  \nThere are few standing architectural monuments left from Pandyan ruling and no temples surviving in Madurai, Pandya's capital, preceding the sixteenth century. The temples that do remain, depict the notable features attributed to the rule of the Pandyan kings.  \n### Kalugumalai Temple complex (768–800 CE)  \nKalugumalai is a region of the Pandyan dynasty, home to the Kalugumalai Murugan temple. The Kalugumalai temple complex is designed in Dravidian style and comprises a Gopuram and a Vimana. The entranceway into the Kalugumalai depicts stone cut elephants, creditable to early Pandya's and the exterior of the temple is lined with inscriptions narrating stories of the Lord of the Pandyan empire.  \n* Kalugumalai Jain Beds  \n* Kalugasalamoorthy Temple  \n### Kunnakudi temple  \nKunnakudi Shanmughanathar temple(also called Kundrakudi Temple or Kunnakudi Murugan Temple) in Kundrakudi, a village in the outskirts of Karaikudi in Sivaganga district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, is dedicated to the Shaivate god Murugan. Constructed in the Pandyan art and architecture, the temple is located in the Tirupattur – Karaikudi Road, around abbr=on from Karaikudi. There are three caves located on the western side of the lower rock, that has rock-cut shrines from the Pandyan Empire from the 8th century. The caves have the earliest sculptural representation of Dvarapalas, the guardian deities, for any South Indian temple.The temple has a five-tiered gateway tower, the gopuram in the hill, leading to a pillared hall and the sanctum.  \n### Vettuvan koil  \nVettuvan koil is a temple structure carved into the side of a rocky cliff that can be attributed to the Pandyas circa 8th century ACE. Although unfinished, the temple displays a rectangular front area with a square vimana bordered by realistic rock-cut sculptures of flowers and Jain figures. The carvings are separated into various levels that reflect the bas-relief art form significant to Pandyan communities. Vettuvan koil is Tamil for 'heaven of sculptures' and it was carved under rule of Pandyan King, Parantakan Nedunjadaiyan. It is bordered by pavement and has the shikhara (rising peak of the temple) coming out directly from the canopy. It is architecturally notable for its intricate shrine carved in the middle that has sculptures seated around the border. These sculptures are unique as they do not reflect the typical position of ancient south Indian and Pandyan figures. Usually, figures are sculpted in a front-on position, however the sculptures of Vettuvan koil are seated, unlike others throughout India.  \n### Āņaimalai  \nĀņaimalai is a district of south India that is home to key landmarks of Pandyan architecture. A rock cut temple cave, referred to in modern times as the Narasinga-perumal temple is located here. It is a stone temple with two pillars cut out and a shrine in the centre. Just near to this is another rock cut temple with architectural features similar to that of the Pallava kingdom. It has a lotus engraving on the front pillars and four rock sculptures dedicated to Hindu deity, Vishnu.  \n### Tirunelveli Nellaiappar temple  \nNellaiappar temple is a large rock-cut style temple with five gopurams, notable for the aesthetic features carved into the roof and pillars. The foundations of the temple were built by Pandyan society, and the temple was continually added to by following dynasties. A key feature of the Nellaiappar temple are the 161 musical pillars, which when struck make a different musical note. The Nellaiappar temple was also home to Pandyan paintings of the time, including paintings of lotuses and other floral motifs.  \n* Nellaiappar Temple  \n### Others  \n* Meenakshi Amman Temple  \n* Sittanavasal Cave – Rock cut cave and Paintings from 9th century Pandyan period  \n* Srivilliputhur Andal temple  \n* Ranganathaswamy Temple  \n<image>Kalugumalai Jain Beds, Pandyan Empire, King Parantaka Nedunjadaiya (768–800 CE)Art of the Pandyan Dynasty\n\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following images depicts a structure that was primarily used for religious purposes during the Pandyan Empire?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Malaysian popular music  \nMalaysian popular music, sometimes called shortly Malaysian pop (Pop Malaysia) or abbreviated as M-pop, refers to popular music forms in Malaysia. Although popular music in various languages such as Mandopop are popular and have been produced in Malaysia, Malaysian pop refers to music recorded primarily in the Malay language in Malaysia.  \nMalaysian pop covers a diverse musical genres, such as pop, rock, Ballad, Malaysian Folk Music, hip hop, electronic, and R&B music.  \n## Origin and influences  \nBangsawan theatre in Penang  1895  \nMalaysian popular music has its origin in local musical tradition and popular European music styles. Some of the early musical styles, performers, and songs of Kroncong and lagu-lagu rakyat (folk songs) were common to the musical culture of Malaysia and Indonesia. Starting in the 1920s, local social dance and entertainment music such as asli, inang, joget, dondang sayang, zapin and masri were adapted by Bangsawan troupes to Anglo-American dance band arrangement but keeping the local folk character, and developed into modern Malay popular music. The Bangsawan troupes originated in the 19th century as a form of opera called Wayang Parsi that developed as an adaptation of Persian theatre brought to Malaya by performers from Bombay. They portrayed stories from diverse groups such as Indian, Western, Islamic, Chinese, Indonesian and Malay with music, dance and acting in costumes. The musicians were mostly local Malays, Filipinos and Goans.  Famous early singers such as Temah, Tijah and Dean often incorporated Chinese, Middle Eastern and Indian elements in their songs.  \nWestern popular music has continually influenced Malaysian popular music since its early days.  In the pre-World War II era, songs based on Anglo-American and Latin-American dance music sung in Malay were very popular.  These songs were accompanied by dance bands that became known as orkes Melayu (Malay orchestra).  The orkes Melayu, which influenced dangdut, was played at dance halls in amusement parks, bangsawan shows and other festivities.  Early singers were often Filipinos originally brought to Malaya by the British to form the Selangor State Band (a military band), for example Soliano, D'Cruz and Martinez. In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by Western rock bands, a modified rock combo called kugiran (an acronym of \"kumpulan gitar rancak\", meaning rhythmic guitar bands) often accompanied singers.   From the 1970s to 1980s, a Western orchestral sound also became popular as musical accompaniment in albums, which is widely assumed to be due to the influence of RTM Orchestra.  \nOther musical forms such as Indian, Islamic and other Asian popular music have also exerted their influences at various times, and many international trends in music surfaced in Malaysian pop.  Hindustani music had a long influence on many traditional types of music in the Malay Peninsula, for example in the use of instruments such as the tabla and in the vocal styles of the singers.  More recently, music of J-pop and K-pop have become influential.  \n## History  \n### Early era  \n<image>P. Ramlee and Kasma Booty, 1955.\nThe first recording of music in Malaya was made 1903 by Fred Gaisberg of the Gramophone Company who was sent to record local music in Asia. During the colonial period, Singapore was the center of Malay music industry and recordings were done at the EMI studio there, but the center began to shift to Kuala Lumpur after Malayan independence in 1957, especially after the separation of Singapore in 1965. Until the 1960s, few records were produced locally, and recordings of the singers and film stars done in Malaya were pressed in India and the records sent back to Malaya for sale.  \nOne of the earliest modern Malay pop songs was \"Tudung Periok\", sung by Momo Latiff, who recorded it in the 1930s. Many of the singing stars became popular through Malay films in the early era.  In the 1940s and 1950s, singers who achieved popularity through their films and recordings were P.Ramlee, R. Azmi, Jasni, Ahmad C. B., S. M. Salim, Saloma, Momo Latif, and Nona Aisha. Some of these singers had Bangsawan or Kroncong background.  The songs of this era were influenced by foreign music styles such as those of Latin American dance, Hawaiian music and Indian films.  They were also mostly romantic in nature, in what might be called the \"hatimu hatiku\" (\"your heart, my heart\") syndrome, and for decades Malay pop music was dominated by songs with words like sayang (love), cinta (love) and gadis (girl) in the title.  \nThe most important of the early singers was P. Ramlee whose career spanned a period from the late 1940s through to the early 1970s.  He became the most popular Malay singer and composer with a range of songs such as \"Azizah\", \"Gelora\", \"Dendang Perantau\" and the evergreen \"Di Mana Kan Ku Cari Ganti\".  It has been estimated that he wrote over a thousand songs and recorded around five hundred, some of which still remain popular today.\n\n### 1960s: Pop Yeh-yeh  \nIn the 1960s, Western pop music was particularly influential on local music scenes in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei. When Cliff Richard and the Shadows played in Singapore in 1961, he inspired many copycat acts, and public viewing of the Cliff Richard's films in the region were often augmented with local cover bands emulating their songs.  One particular genre influenced by Western guitar-band called 'Pop Yeh-yeh' came to the forefront and ruled the Malay music scene from 1965 to 1971. This genre was influenced by the music and fashion of The Beatles and other British rock and roll bands during the 1960s that also generally influenced the Malay music industry of that period. In fact, the term \"pop yeh-yeh\" was taken from a line from the popular Beatles song, \"She Loves You\" (\"she loves you, yeah-yeah-yeah\").  \nSouthern European yé-yé music has the same etymology.  \nThe term \"pop yeh yeh\" however was never used in the 1960s but used much later when such music was revived in the 1980s by M. Shariff & The Zurah. It might be that music journalists of the 1980s coined the term.  \nThe first local song in the Pop Yeh-yeh vein was a song called \"Suzanna\", sung by M Osman in 1964. During the height of the pop yeh-yeh craze, a lot of the bands that were formed tried their best to mimic The Beatles in their look, songwriting and performance style, yet the musical style was still taken from The Shadows and The Ventures. These bands, known as kirtans, consists usually of four members who sing on top of handling the basic four musical instruments (two electric guitars, an electric bass, and drums). Most of the bands were formed in both Singapore and Malaysia, with the southern state of Johore and Singapore was the hub of activity for these particular bands. Most of the recordings were done in Singapore such as at the old EMI Studio at MacDonald's House in Orchard Road and many small privately owned studios.  \nThe acronym \"Kugiran\" was first known to the public through Radio Singapore's weekly top chart program \"Lagu Pujaan Minggu Ini\" which was hosted by disc jockey Mohd Ismail Abdullah, also known as DJ M.I.A. The origin of the derived acronym \"kumpulan gitar rancak\" (\"fast guitar music group\") varies: some say it was the idea of a subtitling officer, Daud Abdul Rahman, others say it was P. Ramlee who coined the term to differentiate it from the combo styled Malay bands of earlier times. A Kugiran consists of 5 piece band members and a vocalist, one lead-guitarist, one bassist, one rhythm-guitarist, one organist (keyboardist) and a drummer.  \nThe formation and development of Kugiran encouraged the establishment and existence of various recording companies in Singapore in the 1960s and a lot of these songs were recorded on vinyl and sold well commercially. Some of the singers who made their name during that period include among others M Osman, A Ramlie, Jeffrydin, Roziah Latiff & The Jayhawkers, Adnan Othman, Halim \"Jandaku\" Yatim, Afidah Es, J Kamisah, Siti Zaiton, J. Sham, A Rahman Onn, Hasnah Haron, J Kamisah, Fatimah M Amin, Asmah Atan, Orkid Abdullah, A. Remie, Zamzam, Salim I, Kassim Selamat, M Rahmat, A Karim Jais, M Ishak, Hussien Ismail, Jaafar O, A Halim, Azizah Mohamed, S Jibeng and L Ramlee. Other popular rock and pop bands of the period include The Rhythm Boys, The Siglap Five, The Hooks which featured A Romzi as their lead vocalist (they scored a hit with the song \"Dendang Remaja\"), Siglap Boys, Les Kafilas, Cliffters featuring Rikieno Bajuri, Impian Bateks featuring Run Al-Haj with his popular number \"Naik Kereta Ku\" and a cappella like \"Oh Posmen\", \"Gadis Sekolah\" etc., The Swallows featuring \"La Aube\", \"Angkut-angkut Bilis\" etc. whose vocalist was Kassim Selamat and the EP was featured in a radio station in Germany. There, \"La Aube\" was in the German pop chart. Almost all the above-mentioned artistes were Singaporeans. The most popular ones from the Malaysian side of the divide must include L. Ramli, Roziah Latiff & The Jayhawkers, J.Sham, Orkes Nirvana, The Sangam Boys and Les Flingers. The music and lyrics were usually composed by the bands themselves. The band leaders were also the producers of the albums of the period.date=March 2017  \nThe golden age of pop yeh-yeh started to dwindle in 1971. Since the fall of the popularity of pop yeh-yeh, the center of the Malaysia music industry shifted up north from Singapore to Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur. A lot of composers, songwriters, lyricists, singers, and producers started to gain foothold not only in Kuala Lumpur but also in other cities including Johor Bahru and Ipoh to grab the opportunity of the emerging and rapidly changing Malaysian music industry.  \n### 1970s to 1980s  \nDJ Dave, Hail Amir and Uji Rashid introduced Hindustani-influenced music in the 1970s. Between the late 1970s and mid-1980s, the market for local recordings and artiste was in big demand, bands and musicians performing in clubs and pubs were contracted to record. Although The Jayhawkers led by Joe Chelliah was the first wholly non-Malay pop band to record Malay pop songs as a precursor, it was in the mid-1970s that later non-Malay artistes, bands and businessmen ventured into the Malay music industry. Bands like Alleycats, Headwind, Discovery, Carefree and Cenderawasih took the lead to modernize Malaysian Pop music; solo singers like Sudirman Arshad and Sharifah Aini further push the music to its peak. Between 1979 and early 1980, the emergence of blues outfit/band called The Blues Gang in Malaysia specialising in blues and hard rock/heavy metal outfit/band called Sweet Charity from Singapore have changed the Malaysian music scene.date=March 2017  \nJamal Abdillah rose to fame in the 80s after winning Bintang RTM, following the footsteps of Sudirman Arshad. Along with Sudirman, Jamal became the new pop sensation with his masculine voice, ability to sing traditional Malay songs along with his good looking image. There are several male singers after Jamal who also rose to fame with pop music such as his biggest rival - Aman Shah, Shidee, Nassier Wahab and Rahim Maarof (who later shifted to pioneer rock movement in the late 80s).  \nInternational artiste like Shake (singer) debuted in 1976 in France with French language LP and return to Malaysia in the early 1980 to produce Malay music while still based in France for global market. In the late 80s, Malaysian student turned vocalist Aishah did the same thing like Shake, she signed a record deal with New Zealand-based label with her band The Fan Club. The band released two studio album and one of their singles,\"Don't Let Me Fall Alone\" charted in Billboard Hot 100, which made Aishah as the first Malaysian artiste to enter the US popular song chart.  \nSlow rock, heavy metal and hard rock and the blues also became predominant in the early 1980s, where bands of these genres tend to take a page from popular Western bands like Scorpions, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Def Leppard.  \nM. Nasir – previously of the Singaporean folk rock band Kembara – played a leading role in shaping rock music in Malaysia for a period of almost ten years, working as a songwriter and producer. He produced local rock bands like Search and Wings as well as solo artiste like Rahim Maarof and took them to their highest level of Malaysian rock music. Infringement in the form of duplicating cassettes and CDs became rampant and uncontrollable around this period as sales of these items soar which was supported by the country's wave of economic boom.  \nBetween the mid 80s and early 90s, R&B and Pop music became the focus of the urban youngsters. This music was cosmopolitan and catered to a professional and educated crowd. In 1985, Sheila Majid debuted with an album called \"Dimensi Baru\" which was financed and produced by Roslan Aziz himself. With a lovely mellow voice together with a bunch of creative musicians like Mac Chew and Jenny Chin both influenced by R&B, fusion and jazz achieved their dreams and set a new direction for many Malaysian R&B artistes to come. This was evidently clear when her second album Emosi was released in Indonesia and earned the Best R&B Album in the prestigious BASF awards in 1986. This historical release has changed the facet of the music industry.date=March 2017  \nAnother female pop singer Ramlah Ram also make huge waves in the late 80s with her Malay-pop and dangdut numbers. Ramlah second album in 1988 becoming highest selling Malay album with 200,000 copies.  \n### 1990s  \n<image>Siti Nurhaliza, dubbed as the Malaysian pop princess\nIn 1991, Dato Zainal Abidin – who was a member of the rock act Headwind – released a self-titled solo album, incorporating elements of world music (even including influences such as Paul Simon's album Graceland), plus lyrics that carried social and environmental commentaries. The album became critically and commercially acclaimed, its songs considered a refreshing break from the contemporary melancholic rock ballads that were prevalent at the time.  \nLocal rap and hip-hop also began to flourish with the success of 7-man group 4U2C in the mid-1990s, receiving several gold and platinum wins while three-brother group KRU, wrote numerous rap and hip-hop numbers.  \nIt was also during this decade too that there was fierce competition among pop singers to get their songs to the top of their charts; such as  Aris Ariwatan, Fauziah Latiff, Aishah, Hattan, Awie, Ziana Zain, Ning Baizura, Ella, Amy Mastura and Sheila Majid along pop bands like Slam, Ukays and Spring. Aishah and Rahim Maarof was the most popular artist from 1990 to 1992, followed by Jamal, Ella and Fauziah Latiff (1993), M. Nasir, Ukays, and Amy Mastura (1994) and Awie, Aris and Ziana Zain (1995) and Slam and KRU (1996).  \nMid 1990s marked the era when pop music with traditional elements like dangdut and Malay ethnic shake the market with best-selling albums from singers like Iwan, Amelina, Mas Idayu, Noraniza Idris, To'ki and M. Nasir. With contemporary touch, these singers managed to uplift Malay traditional music to another level.  \nIn 1996, a schoolgirl by the name of Siti Nurhaliza from the rural town of Kuala Lipis, Pahang released an album produced by talented producer Adnan Abu Hassan. This album of pop melayu genre was a huge success. She incorporated different genres such as Malay pop, R&B and Malay traditional music in her later albums with much success, eventually becoming Malaysia's most popular singer.  \nThere was also the breakthrough of the nasyid genre into the mainstream market between mid-1990s until the early 2000s. The genre, which uses only vocals and percussion music developed by vocal groups like Raihan, Rabbani and Brothers, gathered a lot of support from the rural and the religious Muslim demographics.\n\n### The 2000s and present: influence of reality TV and the internet  \n<image>Yuna performing.\n2000s started with a movement towards progressive pop composition. Post Siti Nurhaliza, several female singers making huge waves with chart topping-award-winning hits such as Liza Hanim, Dayang Nurfaizah and Misha Omar. These singers who rose from singing competition organized by Radio Televisyen Malaysia in the late 90s and early 2000s and discovered by music maestro Adnan Abu Hassan managed to sustain a long lasting career in the next decades alongside Siti. Whereas male pop artist Anuar Zain started his adult singing career in the late 90s and became popular with R&B Pop in the early decade and remain popular ever since. This is also another era for R&B boy band after first batch in the late 90s started with Innuendo, Indigo and Option 1 to the later like Ruffedge, VE and Phyne Ballerz.  \nPopularity of pop rock band in the 2000s also proved that Malaysian music becoming more progressive. Among notable pop rock artiste with high-selling albums during this era like Exists, Spider, OAG, Flop Poppy, Butterfingers, Def Gab C, Pretty Ugly, Ezlynn, Elyana and pop duo like Ajai & Nurul making another alternate wavelength to cater new listeners.  \nDuring the mid-2000s, the introduction to the reality television concept revived public interest in music entertainment. Shows such as Akademi Fantasia and Malaysian Idol allowed the public to choose their own stars by sending SMS through hand phones at the audience's convenience. This excited the public because they were involved in the making of a celebrity and could choose who they wanted instead of relying on record companies for the production and distribution. The winners of these singing competitions tend to be seasonal fads; releasing chart-topping debuts but are later relegated into obscurity (though there are exceptions like Jaclyn Victor, Mawi, Stacy Anam, Aizat Amdan, Akim Ahmad and Hafiz Suip), earning them the moniker Artis Mee Segera (\"instant noodle artists\"). Comparing from the past decades, pay TVs and Internet have affected the musical taste of young listeners that prefers foreign music. Several reality TV stars like Akim Ahmad had long journey to get noticed in the local music scene only after reformed a pop rock band The Majistret with  personnels from fellow band members.  \nIn the late 2000s, unsigned Malaysian artists who rose to fame on YouTube and indie music bands such as Hujan, Gerhana Skacinta and Bunkface changed the Malaysian music scene. However, this does not represent the active live music circuit by singer-songwriter performers in pubs and cafes. Yunalis Zarai, a former café singer pioneered the acoustic singer-songwriter trend, leading the way for record labels to debut similar acts. YouTube changed the Malaysian musical landscape in the 2010s. Instead of SMS votes, music lovers gave birth to YouTube stars by the number of views, that crossover into the mainstream such as Najwa Latif, Elizabeth Tan, Sufian Suhaimi and Khai Bahar.  \nYouTube also helped expose unknown foreign music genres such as J-pop and K-pop to the Malaysian audience. The latter's particular worldwide success influenced record companies to try repackage the successful Malaysian boy band and Girl Group formula from the 90s such as KRU, Feminin or 4U2C and bring it to the 2010s. Current active groups are All Star Jefri, Dynda, V.I.P, Max 24:7, Gula-Gula, Forteen, P.O.P and TIGA. KRU from the 90s was active until 2018.  \nIn the 2010s, second generation of reality TV and singing competition stars continue to conquer pop music such as Syamel, Hael Husaini, Ernie Zakri, Ara Johari and Nabila Razali.  The movement to shift Malaysian music to adapt back the 1990s formula was initiated by local labels like Aries Music, FMC and Music Valley started with Aiman Tino, Sufian Suhaimi and Projector Band (2016) as well as Wany Hasrita, Haqiem Rusli and Floor 88 (2017). Dangdut music make another quake in 2010s when Malaysia send delegations of young singers to join Dangdut Akademi Asia from 2015- 2019. With the late Pak Ngah as the judge and Mas Idayu as commentator, Malaysia managed to introduce new dangdut sensation into Indonesian massive markets with names like Shiha Zikir, Syura Badron and Baby Shima Megat got record deals with Indonesian labels. By late 2010s, dangdut music with Malay pop-rock element becoming one of the best selling music in Malaysia.  \nApart from that dance pop and hip hop music rise again when big names like Malique, Joe Flizzow, Altimet and Omar K continue recruit and produce progressive music for new wave of hip hop artiste like Sonaone (2014), Defam, Aman Ra (2016) and Yonnyboi, K-Clique, Kid Santhe (2019) as well as popstars like Nanasheme (2015), Ismail Izzani, As'ad Motawh (2017) and Andi Bernadee, Naim Daniel (2018).\n\n## Challenges  \nBy the late 1990s with the Internet increasing user base, downloading mp3 files through Napster was rampant. Unlicensed CDs were sold in fly-by-night shops and illegal CD hawkers at night markets. Priced at 1/4 of the original price, legal CD albums were no match for these outlets.  \nThere are many factors that have caused the Malaysian music industry to decline:  \n* Excessive copying (copyright infringement is not a new phenomenon in Malaysian music market, it has been a phenomenon since the 1970s, with bootlegged vinyls and audio cassettes selling at the half of the price of the original product)  \n* The revenue for Malaysian music industry decreased from over RM300 million in 1997 to only RM60 million in 2009  \n* Many local record labels out of business  \n* Illegal downloads  \n* The price of original cassettes and CDs decreased  \n* The number of local artists active in the music industry dropped from over 200 in 1997 to less than 100 in 2009  \n* Local record labels has forced local artists to produce album themselves  \n* Many local albums released after 2006 have less songs (mostly 5 – 9 songs)  \nAs a result, Malaysia along with its neighboring country Singapore are countries in South East Asia where illegal music copies outsells legal ones. Sales of domestic and international repertoire are in the same levels in both countries compared to other South East Asian nations.  \nThe unauthorized distributing of music CDs has caused all original albums sold in Malaysia, whether local or foreign to be attached with an original hologram sticker since 2000 before it can be sold. At the time of introduction, it only covers audio CDs, cassettes and music VCDs. In 2003, the sticker was updated with hologram feature and now also covers non-music video releases and video games. Also, in 2004, the certification levels were down from 15,000 copies and 25,000 copies to 10,000 copies and 20,000 copies for an album to be certified as Gold and Platinum, respectively.  \nThe encouragement from the Malaysian government towards privatization of broadcasting stations received support from the public. An array of new radio and TV stations were built. Legal ringtone downloads were an unexpected success to music companies. A music single ringtone downloaded 100,000 times are commonplace.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following artists became known as Malaysia's most popular singer, incorporating a variety of genres such as Malay pop, R&B, and Malay traditional music in their work?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Anthems and nationalistic songs of Canada  \nPatriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British or French patriotism, preceding the first legal steps to independence by over 50 years. The earliest, \"The Bold Canadian\", was written in 1812.  \n## Canadian anthems  \n### National anthem  \n\"O Canada\" is the national anthem of Canada. Calixa Lavallée wrote the music in 1880 as a setting of a French Canadian patriotic poem composed by poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. \"O Canada\" served as one of two de facto national anthems after 1939, officially becoming Canada's singular national anthem in 1980, when the Act of Parliament making it so received Royal Assent and became effective on July 1 as part of that year's Dominion Day celebrations. The national anthem is routinely played before sporting events involving Canadian teams.  \n### Royal anthem  \n\"God Save the King\" is the royal anthem of Canada. There are various claims of authorship and several previous songs of similar style, but the first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus. The song has been used in Canada since the era when it was a collection of British colonies and \"God Save the King\" (or \"God Save the Queen\" during the reign of a female monarch) was played in honour of the British monarch. It has remained in use through Canada's progression to independence, becoming eventually one of the country's two de facto national anthems. After \"O Canada\" was in 1980 proclaimed the national anthem, \"God Save the Queen\" has been designated as the royal anthem, played in the presence of the Canadian monarch, other members of the Royal Family, and as part of the salute accorded to the Governor General of Canada and provincial lieutenant governors. It can also be played on other occasions.  \n## Provincial anthems  \n\"Alberta\" is the official provincial song of Alberta, adopted in preparation for the province's centennial celebrations in 2005. The song was selected following a competition mandated by the Alberta Official Song Act, introduced in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in May 2001 and passed in November.  \n<image>Lucy Maud Montgomery ca. 1935\n\"The Island Hymn\" is a provincial anthem of Prince Edward Island. The hymn's lyrics were written in 1908 by Lucy Maud Montgomery, with music written by Lawrence W. Watson. It was performed for the first time in public on May 22, 1908. The manuscript music, dated October 27, 1908, and correspondence relating to it are displayed at Green Gables House, Cavendish. The Island Hymn was adopted as the provincial anthem by the legislative assembly on May 7, 2010. The Provincial Anthem Act includes a French version of the Island Hymn, adapted by Raymond J. Arsenault of Abram-Village and called L'hymne de l'Île.  \n\"Ode to Newfoundland\" is the official provincial anthem of Newfoundland and Labrador. Governor Sir Cavendish Boyle composed it in 1902 as a four-verse poem entitled Newfoundland. It was set to the music of British composer Sir Hubert Parry, a personal friend of Boyle, who composed two settings. On May 20, 1904, it was chosen as Newfoundland's official national anthem (national being understood as a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire on par with Canada). This distinction was dropped when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. Three decades later, in 1980, the province re-adopted the song as an official provincial anthem.  \n\"A Place to Stand, a Place to Grow (Ontari-ari-ari-o!)\" is an unofficial anthem of Ontario. The song was written by Dolores Claman, with English lyrics by Richard Morris, French lyrics by Larry Trudel, and orchestrations by Jerry Toth. It was commissioned by the Progressive Conservative government of John Robarts as the signature tune for a movie of the same name that was featured at the Ontario pavilion at Expo 67, the World's Fair held in Montreal, Quebec, in Canada's Centennial year. It was used again in the Ontario's segment of the short film A Place to Stand, which won the 1967 Academy Award for Live Action Short Film.\n<image>George-Étienne Cartier ca. 1871\n\"Ô Canada! mon pays, mes amours\" is a French-Canadian song, written by George-Étienne Cartier first sung in 1834, during a patriotic banquet of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society held in Montreal. The words were first published in the June 29, 1835, edition of La Minerve and its music in Le Chansonnier des collèges in 1850; it is uncertain when the lyrics and music were put together, probably by Ernest Gagnon sometime between 1850 and 1868. The music currently used was composed by Jean-Baptiste Labelle.  \n\"Gens du pays\" has been called the unofficial national anthem of Quebec. Written by poet, songwriter, and avowed Quebec nationalist Gilles Vigneault (with music co-written by Gaston Rochon), it was first performed by Vigneault on June 24, 1975, during a concert on Montreal's Mount Royal at that year's Fête nationale du Québec ceremony. It quickly became a folk classic, and it has been played frequently at Fête nationale ceremonies since then. The chorus is by far the most famous part of the song: Gens du pays, c'est votre tour / De vous laisser parler d'amour, which, translated, says, \"Folks of the land, it is your turn to let yourselves talk of love.\" At this time, Vigneault invited Quebecers to use this song when someone celebrate a birthday, changing \"Gens du pays\" by \"Mon cher (name)...\". In many families, this song can be heard when the cake approaches.\n\n## Early patriotic songs  \n\"The Bold Canadian\", also known as \"Come all ye bold Canadians\", is a Canadian patriotic song that originated during the War of 1812. The lyrics celebrate the Canadian conquest of Detroit in the Michigan Territory. It is believed that the song was written by a private from the Third York Militia's First Flank Company named Cornelius Flummerfelt. Until 1907, the song was only passed on in oral traditions, with a few different versions gaining popularity. Full versions of the song were not published until 1927 when the Ontario Historical Society published two different versions of the song. A third version was published in 1960. All three varied, with different stanzas and order of stanzas.  \n\"The Maple Leaf Forever\" is an older but unofficial national anthem written by Alexander Muir in 1867. It was in consideration for official national anthem; however, as no French version was ever written, it was never popular with Francophones.  \nLa feuille d'érable (the maple leaf) is a patriotic French-Canadian song written by Albert Viau for a song book named  La bonne chanson. The maple leaf being, originally, a symbol of the French-Canadians adopted in 1834 by the St-Jean Baptiste Society. It is also used even today as a pre-game anthem in Theatrical Improvisation leagues across Québec.  \n## Popular patriotic songs  \n\"Canada\", also known as \"Ca-na-da\", \"The Centennial Song\", or \"Une chanson du centenaire\" in French, was written by Bobby Gimby in 1967 to celebrate Canada's centennial and Expo 67. It was commissioned by the Centennial Commission (a special Federal Government agency), and written in both of Canada's official languages, English and French. The song's recording was performed by the Young Canada Singers, two groups of children – one that sang the French lyrics, led by Montreal conductor Raymond Berthiaume, and another that sang in English, under conductor Laurie Bower in Toronto. The musical score was composed by Ben McPeek. The single went on to be the most successful single in Canada in 1967, selling a then unprecedented 270,000 copies. It was No. 1 for 2 weeks on the RPM Top 100 Singles in Canada in April 1967.  \n<image>Gordon Lightfoot ca. 2008\n\"Something to Sing About\" is a patriotic song written by folk singer Oscar Brand in 1963 that sings the praises of the many different regions of Canada. It was used as the theme for Let's Sing Out, a folk music show that aired on CTV and CBC and was the theme song for the Canadian pavilion at Expo 67, and there was once a movement for it to chosen as Canada's national anthem in 1965.  \n\"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\" is a song by Gordon Lightfoot that describes the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This song was commissioned by the CBC for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967, to start Canada's Centennial year. It appeared on Lightfoot's The Way I Feel album later in the same year. Lightfoot re-recorded the track on his 1975 compilation album, Gord's Gold, with full orchestration (arranged by Lee Holdridge). A live version also appears on his 1969 album Sunday Concert. Additionally, the song was covered by John Mellencamp, George Hamilton IV, and James Keelaghan who performed the song on the Lightfoot tribute album, Beautiful. In 2001, Gordon Lightfoot's \"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\" was honoured as one of the Canadian MasterWorks by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada.  \n\"The Hockey Theme\" is a Canadian theme song written in 1968 by Dolores Claman and orchestrated by Jerry Toth. The theme is popularly associated with Canada's national winter sport: hockey. It gained popularity through associated with CBC Television's Hockey Night in Canada, and Télévision de Radio-Canada's La Soirée du hockey from 1968 until 2008. In 2008 the CBC announced that the negotiations to renew their licence or purchase the theme had been unsuccessful and that they would run a national contest to find a new theme song. The rights were then purchased by rival broadcaster CTV in perpetuity. Beginning in the fall of 2008 the theme could be heard on hockey broadcasts on the CTV-owned TSN and RDS sports channels.  \n\"Northwest Passage\" is an a cappella song written by Stan Rogers. The song appears on an album of the same name released by Rogers in 1981, and is considered one of the classic songs in Canadian music history. In the 2005 CBC Radio One series 50 Tracks: The Canadian Version, \"Northwest Passage\" ranked fourth. It was referred to as one of Canada's unofficial anthems by former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson quoted the song both in her first official address and in her speech at the dedication of the new Canadian embassy in Berlin.  \nThe Tragically Hip, a Canadian rock band active from 1984 until the death of lead singer and lyricist Gord Downie in 2017, were among the best-selling Canadian musicians in Canada. A widely noted signature element of the Hip's collective and Downie's solo catalogues was the extent to which they addressed Canadian themes. The Tragically Hip's relationship with patriotism and nationalism was complicated. \"I’m not a nationalist,\" Downie told his biographer Michael Barclay; Downie said this \"firmly,\" Barclay notes. \"I started using Canadian references not just for their own sake, but because I wanted to pick up my birthright, which is this massive country full of stories,\" Downie continued. In the National Post, Dave Kaufman wrote \"Although Downie sings of Canada, his songs are by no means patriotic, or no more than in the way that we're all influenced by where we're from. The band have never been so obvious as to drape themselves in a Canadian flag, but instead, they evoke that shared experience of what it's meant for many of us to grow up in Canada.\" In the Journal of Canadian Studies, political scientist Gregory Millard discussed the paradoxical question of why \"deeply ambiguous and often critical references to Canada sufficed to raise The Hip to an extraordinary status as icons of Canadian nationalism.\" Millard concluded that \"Canada's position as a culturally peripheral nation is the key to explaining the incongruous appropriation of the Hip’s work for nationalist self-celebration.\"\n\n## First Nations patriotic songs  \n\"O Canada\" has been performed in some First Nation languages during the opening of a few national events. During the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, \"O Canada\" was sung in the southern Tutchone language by Yukon native Daniel Tlen. At a National Hockey League (NHL) game in Calgary on February 1, 2007, young Cree singer Akina Shirt became the first person ever to perform \"O Canada\" in the Cree language at such an event.  \n\"Land of the Silver Birch\" is thought of as a Canadian folk song, written first as a poem by Pauline Johnson. It is associated with camping and canoeing. Its subject matter is a romanticized vision of nature and the land from the perspective of an indigenous person, but it remains popular with the non-Aboriginal majority in Canada. The song appears in the Paul Gross film Men with Brooms (2002). The song was partly re-written in 2005 by Canadian folk singer Dickson Reid and released on his debut album, Sugar in the Snow.  \n## Other patriotic songs  \n* \"Farewell to Nova Scotia\" is a popular folk song from Nova Scotia that is a corruption of the 1791 Scottish folk song \"The Soldier's Adieu\", printed in 1803 in a Glasgow newspaper and attributed to Robert Tannahill. When Nova Scotians began to adapt the song is unknown. In the 1930s, folklorist Helen Creighton collected versions of the folk song from different communities along the eastern shore of Nova Scotia. The song had a resurgence when Halifax CBC TV show Singalong Jubilee used Catherine McKinnon's version as the title theme.  \n* \"The Banks of Newfoundland\" was composed by Chief Justice Francis Forbes sometime around 1820, and was adopted as the authorized march of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment.  \n* A Canadianized version of Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" was released in 1955 by the folk group the Travellers.  \n* American country musician Lee Greenwood released \"God Bless You Canada\" in 1989, an adaptation of his American patriotic song \"God Bless the USA\"  \n* Stompin' Tom Connors sang about places in Canada, encouraging people in every Canadian province to be proud of their home.\n\nQuestion: Which individual is associated with a song that was once considered for Canada's national anthem?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Structural integrity and failure  \n<image>Collapsed barn at Hörsne, Gotland, Sweden\nStructural integrity and failure is an aspect of engineering that deals with the ability of a structure to support a designed structural load (weight, force, etc.) without breaking and includes the study of past structural failures in order to prevent failures in future designs.  \nStructural integrity is the ability of an item—either a structural component or a structure consisting of many components—to hold together under a load, including its own weight, without breaking or deforming excessively. It assures that the construction will perform its designed function during reasonable use, for as long as its intended life span. Items are constructed with structural integrity to prevent catastrophic failure, which can result in injuries, severe damage, death, and/or monetary losses.  \nStructural failure refers to the loss of structural integrity, or the loss of load-carrying capacity in either a structural component or the structure itself. Structural failure is initiated when a material is stressed beyond its strength limit, causing fracture or excessive deformations; one limit state that must be accounted for in structural design is ultimate failure strength. In a well designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure.\n\n## Introduction  \nStructural integrity is the ability of a structure to withstand its intended loading without failing due to fracture, deformation, or fatigue. It is a concept often used in engineering to produce items that will serve their designed purposes and remain functional for a desired service life.  \nTo construct an item with structural integrity, an engineer must first consider a material's mechanical properties, such as toughness, strength, weight, hardness, and elasticity, and then determine the size and shape necessary for the material to withstand the desired load for a long life. Since members can neither break nor bend excessively, they must be both stiff and tough. A very stiff material may resist bending, but unless it is sufficiently tough, it may have to be very large to support a load without breaking. On the other hand, a highly elastic material will bend under a load even if its high toughness prevents fracture.  \nFurthermore, each component's integrity must correspond to its individual application in any load-bearing structure. Bridge supports need a high yield strength, whereas the bolts that hold them need good shear and tensile strength. Springs need good elasticity, but lathe tooling needs high rigidity. In addition, the entire structure must be able to support its load without its weakest links failing, as this can put more stress on other structural elements and lead to cascading failures.  \n## History  \n<image>The Pyramid at Meidum was the second built by the Egyptians around 2600 BC. It suffered from many structural defects, causing it to collapse during construction and leaving the inner core standing in a pile of rubble, which provided one of the earliest known lessons in large-scale building.\nThe need to build structures with integrity goes back as far as recorded history. Houses needed to be able to support their own weight, plus the weight of the inhabitants. Castles needed to be fortified to withstand assaults from invaders. Tools needed to be strong and tough enough to do their jobs. However, the science of fracture mechanics as it exists today was not developed until the 1920s, when Alan Arnold Griffith studied the brittle fracture of glass.  \nStarting in the 1940s, the infamous failures of several new technologies made a more scientific method for analyzing structural failures necessary.  During World War II, over 200 welded-steel ships broke in half due to brittle fracture, caused by stresses created from the welding process, temperature changes, and by the stress concentrations at the square corners of the bulkheads.  In the 1950s, several De Havilland Comets exploded in mid-flight due to stress concentrations at the corners of their squared windows, which caused cracks to form and the pressurized cabins to explode.  Boiler explosions, caused by failures in pressurized boiler tanks, were another common problem during this era, and caused severe damage. The growing sizes of bridges and buildings led to even greater catastrophes and loss of life. This need to build constructions with structural integrity led to great advances in the fields of material sciences and fracture mechanics.\n\n## Types of failure  \nBuilding collapse due to snow weight  \nStructural failure can occur from many types of problems, most of which are unique to different industries and structural types. However, most can be traced to one of five main causes.  \n* The first is that the structure is not strong and tough enough to support the load, due to either its size, shape, or choice of material. If the structure or component is not strong enough, catastrophic failure can occur when the structure is stressed beyond its critical stress level.  \n* The second type of failure is from fatigue or corrosion, caused by instability in the structure's geometry, design or material properties. These failures usually begin when cracks form at stress points, such as squared corners or bolt holes too close to the material's edge.  These cracks grow as the material is repeatedly stressed and unloaded (cyclic loading), eventually reaching a critical length and causing the structure to suddenly fail under normal loading conditions.  \n* The third type of failure is caused by manufacturing errors, including improper selection of materials, incorrect sizing, improper heat treating, failing to adhere to the design, or shoddy workmanship.  This type of failure can occur at any time and is usually unpredictable.  \n* The fourth type of failure is from the use of defective materials.  This type of failure is also unpredictable, since the material may have been improperly manufactured or damaged from prior use.  \n* The fifth cause of failure is from lack of consideration of unexpected problems.  This type of failure can be caused by events such as vandalism, sabotage, or natural disasters. It can also occur if those who use and maintain the construction are not properly trained and overstress the structure.  \n## Notable failures  \n### Bridges  \n#### Dee bridge  \nThe Dee bridge after its collapse  \nThe Dee bridge was designed by Robert Stephenson, using cast iron girders reinforced with wrought iron struts.  On 24 May 1847, it collapsed as a train passed over it, killing five people.  Its collapse was the subject of one of the first formal inquiries into a structural failure.  This inquiry concluded that the design of the structure was fundamentally flawed, as the wrought iron did not reinforce the cast iron, and that the casting had failed due to repeated flexing.  \n#### First Tay Rail Bridge  \nThe Dee bridge disaster was followed by a number of cast iron bridge collapses, including the collapse of the first Tay Rail Bridge on 28 December 1879. Like the Dee bridge, the Tay collapsed when a train passed over it, killing 75 people.  The bridge failed because it was constructed from poorly made cast iron, and because designer Thomas Bouch failed to consider wind loading on it.  Its collapse resulted in cast iron being replaced by steel construction, and a complete redesign in 1890 of the Forth Railway Bridge, which became the first bridge in the world entirely made of steel.  \n#### First Tacoma Narrows Bridge  \nThe 1940 collapse of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge is sometimes characterized in physics textbooks as a classic example of resonance, although this description is misleading. The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated oscillation between the bridge and winds passing through it, known as aeroelastic flutter. Robert H. Scanlan, a leading contributor to the understanding of bridge aerodynamics, wrote an article about this misunderstanding. This collapse, and the research that followed, led to an increased understanding of wind/structure interactions. Several bridges were altered following the collapse to prevent a similar event occurring again. The only fatality was a dog named Tubby.  \n#### I-35W Bridge  \nSecurity camera images show the I-35W collapse in animation, looking north.  \nThe I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially known simply as Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane steel truss arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The bridge was completed in 1967, and its maintenance was performed by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. The bridge was Minnesota's fifth–busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The bridge catastrophically failed during the evening rush hour on 1 August 2007, collapsing to the river and riverbanks beneath. Thirteen people were killed and 145 were injured. Following the collapse, the Federal Highway Administration advised states to inspect the 700 U.S. bridges of similar construction after a possible design flaw in the bridge was discovered, related to large steel sheets called gusset plates which were used to connect girders together in the truss structure. Officials expressed concern about many other bridges in the United States sharing the same design and raised questions as to why such a flaw would not have been discovered in over 40 years of inspections.  \n### Buildings  \n#### Thane building collapse  \nOn 4 April 2013, a building collapsed on tribal land in Mumbra, a suburb of Thane in Maharashtra, India. It has been called the worst building collapse in the area: 74 people died, including 18 children, 23 women, and 33 men, while more than 100 people survived.  \nThe building was under construction and did not have an occupancy certificate for its 100 to 150 low- to middle-income residents  \nits only occupants were the site construction workers and their families.  The building was reported to have been illegally constructed because standard practices were not followed for safe, lawful construction, land acquisition and resident occupancy.  \nBy 11 April, a total of 15 suspects were arrested including builders, engineers, municipal officials, and other responsible parties. Governmental records indicate that there were two orders to manage the number of illegal buildings in the area: a 2005 Maharashtra state order to use remote sensing and a 2010 Bombay High Court order. Complaints were also made to state and municipal officials.  \nOn 9 April, the Thane Municipal Corporation began a campaign to demolish illegal buildings in the area, focusing on \"dangerous\" buildings, and set up a call center to accept and track the resolutions of complaints about illegal buildings.  The forest department, meanwhile, promised to address encroachment of forest land in the Thane District.  \n#### Savar building collapse  \nOn 24 April 2013, Rana Plaza, an eight-storey commercial building, collapsed in Savar, a sub-district in the Greater Dhaka Area, the capital of Bangladesh. The search for the dead ended on 13 May with the death toll of 1,134. Approximately 2,515 injured people were rescued from the building alive.  \nIt is considered to be the deadliest garment-factory accident in history, as well as the deadliest accidental structural failure in modern human history.  \nThe building contained clothing factories, a bank, apartments, and several other shops. The shops and the bank on the lower floors immediately closed after cracks were discovered in the building. Warnings to avoid using the building after cracks appeared the day before had been ignored. Garment workers were ordered to return the following day and the building collapsed during the morning rush-hour.  \n#### Sampoong Department Store collapse  \nOn 29 June 1995, the five-story Sampoong Department Store in the Seocho District of Seoul, South Korea collapsed resulting in the deaths of 502 people, with another 1,445 being trapped.  \nIn April 1995, cracks began to appear in the ceiling of the fifth floor of the store's south wing due to the presence of an air-conditioning unit on the weakened roof of the poorly built structure. On the morning of 29 June, as the number of cracks in the ceiling increased dramatically, store managers closed the top floor and shut off the air conditioning, but failed to shut the building down or issue formal evacuation orders as the executives themselves left the premises as a precaution.  \nFive hours before the collapse, the first of several loud bangs was heard emanating from the top floors, as the vibration of the air conditioning caused the cracks in the slabs to widen further. Amid customer reports of vibration in the building, the air conditioning was turned off but, the cracks in the floors had already grown to 10 cm wide. At about 5:00 p.m. local time, the fifth-floor ceiling began to sink, and at 5:57 p.m., the roof gave way, sending the air conditioning unit crashing through into the already-overloaded fifth floor.  \n#### Ronan Point  \nOn 16 May 1968, the 22-story residential tower Ronan Point in the London Borough of Newham collapsed when a relatively small gas explosion on the 18th floor caused a structural wall panel to be blown away from the building. The tower was constructed of precast concrete, and the failure of the single panel caused one entire corner of the building to collapse. The panel was able to be blown out because there was insufficient reinforcement steel passing between the panels. This also meant that the loads carried by the panel could not be redistributed to other adjacent panels, because there was no route for the forces to follow. As a result of the collapse, building regulations were overhauled to prevent disproportionate collapse and the understanding of precast concrete detailing was greatly advanced. Many similar buildings were altered or demolished as a result of the collapse.  \n#### Oklahoma City bombing  \nOn 19 April 1995, the nine-story concrete framed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma was struck by a truck bomb causing partial collapse, resulting in the deaths of 168 people. The bomb, though large, caused a significantly disproportionate collapse of the structure. The bomb blew all the glass off the front of the building and completely shattered a ground floor reinforced concrete column (see brisance). At second story level a wider column spacing existed, and loads from upper story columns were transferred into fewer columns below by girders at second floor level. The removal of one of the lower story columns caused neighbouring columns to fail due to the extra load, eventually leading to the complete collapse of the central portion of the building. The bombing was one of the first to highlight the extreme forces that blast loading from terrorism can exert on buildings, and led to increased consideration of terrorism in structural design of buildings.  \n#### Versailles wedding hall  \nThe Versailles wedding hall (אולמי ורסאי), located in Talpiot, Jerusalem, is the site of the worst civil disaster in Israel's history. At 22:43 on Thursday night, 24 May 2001 during the wedding of Keren and Asaf Dror, a large portion of the third floor of the four-story building collapsed, killing 23 people. The bride and the groom survived.  \n#### World Trade Center Towers 1, 2, and 7  \nIn the September 11 attacks, two commercial airliners were deliberately crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. The impact, explosion and resulting fires caused both towers to collapse within less than two hours. The impacts severed exterior columns and damaged core columns, redistributing the loads that these columns had carried.  This redistribution of loads was greatly influenced by the hat trusses at the top of each building. The impacts dislodged some of the fireproofing from the steel, increasing its exposure to the heat of the fires. Temperatures became high enough to weaken the core columns to the point of creep and plastic deformation under the weight of higher floors.  The heat of the fires also weakened the perimeter columns and floors, causing the floors to sag and exerting an inward force on exterior walls of the building. WTC Building 7 also collapsed later that day; the 47 story skyscraper collapsed within seconds due to a combination of a large fire inside the building and heavy structural damage from the collapse of the North Tower.  \n#### Champlain Towers  \nOn 24 June 2021, Champlain Towers South, a 12-story condominium building in Surfside, Florida partially collapsed, causing dozens of injuries and 98 deaths. The collapse was captured on video. One person was rescued from the rubble, and about 35 people were rescued on 24 June from the uncollapsed portion of the building. Long-term degradation of reinforced concrete-support structures in the underground parking garage, due to water penetration and corrosion of the reinforcing steel, has been considered as a factor in—or the cause of—the collapse. The issues had been reported in 2018 and noted as \"much worse\" in April 2021. A $15 million program of remedial works had been approved at the time of the collapse.  \n### Aircraft  \n<image>A 1964 B-52 Stratofortress test demonstrated the same failure that caused the 1963 Elephant Mountain & 1964 Savage Mountain crashes.\nRepeat structural failures on the same type of aircraft occurred in 1954, when two de Havilland Comet C1 jet airliners crashed due to decompression caused by metal fatigue, and in 1963–64, when the vertical stabilizer on four Boeing B-52 bombers broke off in mid-air.\n\n### Other  \n#### Warsaw Radio Mast  \nThe Warsaw radio mast after collapse  \nOn 8 August 1991 at 16:00 UTC Warsaw radio mast, the tallest man-made object ever built before the erection of Burj Khalifa collapsed as consequence of an error in exchanging the guy-wires on the highest stock. The mast first bent and then snapped at roughly half its height. It destroyed at its collapse a small mobile crane of Mostostal Zabrze. As all workers had left the mast before the exchange procedures, there were no fatalities, in contrast to the similar collapse of the WLBT Tower in 1997.  \n#### Hyatt Regency walkway  \nDesign change on the Hyatt Regency walkways.On 17 July 1981, two suspended walkways through the lobby of the Hyatt Regency in Kansas City, Missouri, collapsed, killing 114 and injuring more than 200 people at a tea dance. The collapse was due to a late change in design, altering the method in which the rods supporting the walkways were connected to them, and inadvertently doubling the forces on the connection. The failure highlighted the need for good communication between design engineers and contractors, and rigorous checks on designs and especially on contractor-proposed design changes. The failure is a standard case study on engineering courses around the world, and is used to teach the importance of ethics in engineering.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a structure that suffered from structural defects during its construction, leading to a partial collapse?\nChoice list: \nA.

Contested over 267 laps, it was the eighth race of the 2012 season. Denny Hamlin of Joe Gibbs Racing took his second win of the season, while Martin Truex Jr. finished second and Jimmie Johnson finished third.  \n## Report  \n### Background  \n<image>Kansas Speedway, the race track where the race was held.\nKansas Speedway is one of ten  intermediate tracks to hold NASCAR races. The standard track at Kansas Speedway is a four-turn D-shaped oval track that is km long. The track's turns are banked at fifteen degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is 10.4 degrees. The back stretch, opposite of the front, is at only five degrees. The racetrack has seats for 82,000 spectators.  \nBefore the race, Greg Biffle led the Drivers' Championship with 273 points, and Matt Kenseth stood in second with 254. Dale Earnhardt Jr. was third in the Drivers' Championship also with 254 points, one ahead of Martin Truex Jr. and five ahead of Kevin Harvick in fourth and fifth. Denny Hamlin with 242 was eight ahead of Tony Stewart, as Jimmie Johnson with 233 points, was eight ahead of Ryan Newman, and fourteen in front of Clint Bowyer. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was leading with 48 points, six ahead of Ford. Toyota, with 34 points, was 30 points ahead of Dodge in the battle for third. Brad Keselowski was the race's defending race winner after winning it in 2011.\n\n### Practice and qualifying  \n<image>A. J. Allmendinger (pictured in 2015) won the pole position, after having the fastest time of 30.683 seconds.\nTwo practice sessions were held before the race on Friday. The first session lasted 80 minutes long, while the second was 90 minutes long. Kyle Busch was quickest with a time of 31.083 seconds in the first session, over one-tenth of a second faster than Carl Edwards. Kasey Kahne was third, followed by Landon Cassill, Earnhardt Jr., and Newman. Stewart was seventh, still within a second of Kyle Busch's time. In the second practice session, Johnson was fastest with a time of 30.865 seconds, only 0.113 seconds quicker than second-placed Mark Martin. Biffle took third place, ahead of Keselowski, Sam Hornish Jr. and Edwards. Jeff Burton managed to be seventh quickest.  \nForty-six cars were entered for qualifying, but only forty-three can race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. A. J. Allmendinger clinched his second pole position during his career, with a time of 30.683 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Harvick. Joey Logano qualified third, Hamlin took fourth, and Martin started fifth. Truex Jr., Earnhardt Jr., Bowyer, Kahne, and Hornish Jr. rounded out the first ten positions. The three drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Tim Andrews, Jeff Green and Tony Raines, who had times of 31.820 and 31.846 seconds.\n\n### Race  \nThe race, the eighth in the season, started at 1:16 p.m. EDT and was televised live in the United States on Fox. The conditions on the grid were dry before the race and overcast skies are expected.  Cole Cochran, of Kansas City Alliance Raceway Ministries, began pre-race ceremonies, by giving the invocation. Next, Jeremy Vitt performed the national anthem, and Victory Junction Gang Camp ambassadors gave the command for drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, Logano had to move to the rear of the grid because of changing his engine.  \n## Results  \n### Qualifying  \n### Race results  \n<image>Denny Hamlin won the race.\n\n\n## Standings after the race  \nDrivers' Championship standings  \nManufacturers' Championship standings  \n* Note: Only the top five positions are included for the driver standings.\n\nQuestion: Which driver won the pole position for the NASCAR race at Kansas Speedway?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Petar Baćović  \nPetar Baćović (Петар Баћовић; 1898 – April 1945) was a Bosnian Serb Chetnik commander (vojvoda, војвода) within occupied Yugoslavia during World War II. From the summer of 1941 until April 1942, he headed the cabinet of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Milan Nedić's puppet Government of National Salvation in the German-occupied territory of Serbia. In May and June 1942, Baćović participated in the joint Italian-Chetnik offensive against the Yugoslav Partisans in Montenegro In July 1942, Baćović was appointed by the Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović and his Supreme Command as the commander of the Chetnik units in the regions of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina within the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH). In this role, Baćović continued collaborating with the Italians against the Yugoslav Partisans, with his Chetniks formally recognised as Italian auxiliaries from mid-1942.  \nAlong with other Chetniks, in August and September 1942 Baćović and his Chetniks carried out massacres of Bosnian Muslim and Croat civilians and those sympathetic to the Partisan movement, amounting to more than 5,000 dead. The following month, while participating in a joint Italian-German operation around Prozor, Operation Alfa, Baćović and his Chetniks burnt Croat and Muslim villages and killed between 500 and 2,000 Croats and Muslims. The Italians reacted strongly to this and threatened to withdraw their support for the Chetniks, after which Baćović attempted to distance himself from the killings. Baćović's Chetniks committed further atrocities against Croats and Muslims in Mostar and Konjic in November and Vrlika in January 1943. In early 1943, Baćović was appointed as a vojvoda by the ailing principal Chetnik leader in Herzegovina, Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin. Baćović engaged in considerable anti-Semitic propaganda aimed at the Partisan leadership.  \nIn April 1945, he was captured near Banja Luka by elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Zaharije Ostojić, and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić in what was apparently a trap. According to some sources, Baćović and the others were taken to the area of the Jasenovac concentration camp, where they were killed.  \n## Early life  \nPetar Baćović was born in 1898 in Kalinovik, a village within the Bosnia Vilayet, a province of the Ottoman Empire that was occupied by Austria-Hungary in 1878. It is now in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His father Maksim was a clan chief. Prior to World War II, Baćović was a major in the Royal Yugoslav Army reserve. He also studied law, did legal work, and was a governor's notary immediately prior to the outbreak of war.  \n## World War II  \n### Ministry of Internal Affairs under Nedić  \nFrom the summer of 1941, Baćović headed the cabinet of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Milan Nedić's German-installed puppet Government of National Salvation in the German-occupied territory of Serbia. Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, with no direct control over the many independent Chetnik bands throughout partitioned and occupied Yugoslavia, had been corresponding with some of their leaders via letter and courier. Following an agreement between Nedić and Mihailović, in April 1942 Baćović left Belgrade and went to join the Chetniks operating in eastern Bosnia, then part of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH). He was sent as Mihailović's permanent representative to Dobroslav Jevđević and Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin, the main spokesmen for the Chetnik bands in Herzegovina.  \n### 1942 Montenegro offensive  \nFrom mid-May to early June 1942, Baćović took part in the joint Italian-Chetnik 1942 Montenegro offensive against the Partisans, which also included operations in eastern Herzegovina. Baćović led Chetnik forces fighting against the Partisans in the Sandžak region that straddled the border between the Italian governorate of Montenegro and the German-occupied territory of Serbia. His troops fought alongside Sandžak Chetniks led by Zdravko Kasalović and Vojislav Lukačević, and the Požega Chetnik detachment led by Vučko Ignjatović and Miloš Glišić. The Požega Chetniks had been \"legalised\" as auxiliaries by the Nedić puppet government with the approval of the Germans. These forces also fought alongside the Italian 19th Infantry Division Venezia and 5th Alpine Division Pusteria, and were one of three main Chetnik formations involved in the joint offensive, the others being led by the Montenegrin Serbs Pavle Đurišić and Bajo Stanišić. In the face of the three-pronged assault, the outnumbered Partisan forces withdrew from Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina into southeastern Bosnia, and then undertook the Partisan Long March to western Bosnia. At the end of May, Baćović submitted a report to Mihailović on Đurišić's troops and the significant amounts of weapons and equipment he had received from the Italians.  \n### Legalization by the Italians  \nIn the summer of 1942, after order had been established in significant parts of the Italian occupation zone of the NDH, Chetnik detachment leaders including Petar Samardžić, Momčilo Đujić, Uroš Drenović, Jevđević, Trifunović-Birčanin, and their principal political spokesmen with Italian Second Army headquarters were recognized as auxiliaries by the Italians. Early in that summer, the commander of the Italian Second Army, Generale designato d’armata (acting General) Mario Roatta, agreed to the delivery of arms, munitions, and supplies to the Chetniks. On 16 July 1942, Baćović, acting as one of Jevđević's military organizers, informed Mihailović that the vast majority of the 7,000 Chetniks in Herzegovina were well equipped with small arms and had been \"legalized\" by the Italians. Combined with Đujić's group, the number of \"legalized\" Chetniks in the Italian zone of the NDH stood at 10,000 or more.  \nFrom March 1942 on, Mihailović had been looking for opportunities to create a \"national corridor\" connecting all the Chetnik groups operating in the Italian-occupied areas of the NDH, from Montenegro, Herzegovina, Dalmatia, to Lika and western Bosnia. In June, to advance Mihailović's aim of creating a \"national corridor\", Jevđević offered to send 2,000 Herzegovinian Chetniks to Dalmatia, where they would be placed under the control of Trifunović-Birčanin. Transfer of Chetnik forces to Dalmatia also created an opportunity to strike at the major concentration of Partisan strength at that time, which was in western Bosnia.  \nIn early June 1942, troops of Petar Baćović and Miloš Glišić attacked together Partisans. Chetniks quickly came to Foča forcing Partisans to retreat to Gacko. They encountered NDH forces, and captured the town from them on June 10. This time Muslim population wasn't harmed. This capture was only temporary as Italians, pressured by Germans and Ustaše, order Chetniks to retreat on July 30, and Baćović begrudgingly captured NDH soldiers.  \n### Zimonjić Kula conference  \nOn 22 and 23 July 1942, Mihailović held a conference at Zimonjić Kula, near Avtovac in eastern Herzegovina, which was attended by Trifunović-Birčanin, Đurišić, Jevđević, Zaharije Ostojić, Radovan Ivanišević, Milan Šantić and a group of Chetnik commanders from Herzegovina. The purpose of the meeting was to establish co-operation between the Herzegovinian and Montenegrin Chetnik leaders. Baćović was appointed as the Chetnik commander for eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, replacing Boško Todorović, who had been captured and executed by the Partisans in late February 1942. Trifunović-Birčanin was appointed the Chetnik commander for Dalmatia, Lika and western Bosnia.  \nThe historian Fikreta Jelić-Butić believes that the idea of an anti-Partisan offensive was also discussed at the conference as a potential response to the Zagreb agreement concluded between Italy and the NDH in June. The Zagreb agreement heralded a major drawdown of Italian occupation forces from large areas of the NDH, including areas of Bosnia south of the Italian-German demarcation line, as well as Kordun, Lika and Dalmatia, and the Chetnik leaders believed that this would reduce the area in which they could operate with Italian consent. On the second day of the conference, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin travelled to nearby Trebinje and conferred with two other Chetnik commanders, Radmilo Grđić and Milan Šantić, who agreed on a set of goals and a strategy to achieve them:  \n* the creation of Greater Serbia;  \n* the destruction of the Partisans;  \n* the removal of the Catholics (Croats) and Muslims;  \n* non-recognition of the NDH;  \n* no collaboration with the Germans; and  \n* temporary collaboration with the Italians for weapons, munitions and food.  \nThe Chetniks addressed a crowd in Trebinje, announcing that they had cells in every village in eastern Herzegovina, and were establishing a Greater Serbia. Only five days after Baćović's appointment, the commander of the Mountain Staff of the Bosnian Chetnik Detachments, Stevan Botić, demanded Baćović be replaced. Botić had appointed himself as commander of the Mountain Staff after the previous commander, Jezdimir Dangić, had been arrested in Bajina Bašta in April 1942. Botić and his allies opposed Mihailović's control because they favoured a political rather than strictly military organisation, wanted to continue the alliance with the Nedić regime that Dangić had forged, and opposed the control of Bosnian Chetniks by non-Bosnians. Botić also wanted to remain independent of Mihailović so that he could freely kill Muslims and Bosnian Croats without damaging Mihailović's standing with the Serb people through close association with Botić's activities. Soon after the conference, both Baćović and Trifunović-Birčanin were negotiating with Italian VI Corps and XVIII Corps headquarters staff regarding the proposed offensive against the Partisans in western Bosnia.  \nBy August, Baćović was advocating the \"liquidation\" of Botić's Mountain Staff because they were creating disunity, and trying to politicise the Chetnik movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the model of the League of Farmers, which had defended the interests of Bosnian Serb peasants against Muslim landowners during the interwar period. On 6 August 1942, in a continued Chetnik effort to eliminate external enemies and purge their own ranks, Baćović ordered the subordinate commanders of all corps and brigades to submit lists of such individuals with suggestions on how to deal with them. Brigade commanders were required to send three assassins to kill any person whom they labelled with the letter \"Z\" (from the links=no, meaning  \"to slaughter\") within 24 hours of receiving the name. Baćović demanded that \"the killing has to be done exclusively through the use of slaughtering knife\".  \n### Capture of Foča and massacres of Muslims and Croats  \n<image>Baćović's Chetniks killed 900 Croats in villages around the coastal town of Makarska.\nOn 19 August, Chetniks commanded by Ostojić, but drawn mainly from Đurišić's Lim-Sandžak Chetnik Detachment and acting on the orders of Mihailović, attacked and captured the eastern Bosnian town of Foča, which had been abandoned by the Partisans in June and had then been occupied by NDH forces. After a two-hour battle, Chetnik units entered Foča and began massacring the Muslim population of the town, regardless of gender and age. According to the initial Chetnik reports, a total of 1,000 people were killed, including about 450 members of the Croatian Home Guard and Ustaše Militia, as well as around 300 women and children. Later Chetnik reports stated that between 2,000 and 3,000 were killed in Foča after its capture. A few days after they seized Foča, Baćović and Jevđević reported to Mihailović that all traces of the massacre had been removed and they had formally announced that those responsible for looting and killing had been shot. Eight days after the capture of Foča, Baćović wrote, \"on that occasion 1,200 Ustaše in uniform and about 1,000 compromised Muslims perished, while we suffered only four dead and five wounded\".  \nAt a field near Ustikolina and Jahorina in eastern Bosnia, the Chetniks of Baćović and Ostojić massacred about 2,500 Muslims and burned a number of villages. Baćović also killed a number of Partisan sympathizers elsewhere. In September 1942, Baćović completed a tour of Chetnik units in Herzegovina, and reported that the morale of the population was excellent and that the actions of the Ustaše and Partisans were drawing the populace to the Chetniks. That same month, his Chetniks killed 900 Croats during the Makarska massacre. Baćović's reports made it plain that his forces were conducting planned operations to kill or drive out the Muslim and Catholic population of Herzegovina. One of these reports stated that during reprisal attacks against the towns of Ljubuški in western Herzegovina and Imotski in the Dalmatian hinterland, his Chetniks had skinned alive three Catholic priests, killed all males over fifteen years of age, and razed 17 villages.\n\n### Operation Alfa and subsequent massacres  \n<image>Baćović's Chetniks killed hundreds of Muslim and Croat civilians in Prozor in October 1942, during the Italian-led Operation Alfa.\nTowards the end of August 1942, Mihailović issued directives to Chetnik units ordering them to prepare for a large scale anti-Partisan operation alongside Italian and NDH troops. In August Baćović Chetniks participate in Italian anti-Partisan operation Albia, and on August 29 kill 141 Croats in Makarska region and burn down 4 villages. In September 1942, aware that they were unable to defeat the Partisans alone, the Chetniks tried to persuade the Italians to undertake a large operation against the Partisans in western Bosnia. Trifunović-Birčanin met with Roatta on 10 and 21 September and urged him to undertake this operation as soon as possible to clear the Partisans from the Prozor–Livno area and offered 7,500 Chetniks as aid on the condition that they be provided with the necessary arms and supplies. He was successful in obtaining some arms and promises of action. The proposed operation, faced with opposition from Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić and a cautious Italian high command, was nearly cancelled, but after Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin promised to cooperate with Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan units, it went ahead, with less Chetnik involvement.  \nBaćović and Jevđević, with 3,000 Herzegovinian Chetniks, participated in the Italian-led Operation Alfa, which involved a two-pronged thrust towards Prozor. The Chetniks fought alongside the Italian 18th Infantry Division Messina as they advanced from the line of the Neretva River, while the German 714th and 718th Infantry Divisions, and NDH forces drove from the north. Before the offensive Baćović had openly announced his plans to destroy entire Muslim villages. Prozor and some smaller towns were captured by the combined Italian–Chetnik force. Chetniks under Baćović and Jevđević's command participated enthusiastically in the operation, burning Croat and Muslim villages and killing civilians. Between 14 and 15 October, the Herzegovinian Chetniks massacred over 500 Muslims and Croats and razed several villages, alleging that they had \"harbored and aided the Partisans\". On 23 October, Baćović reported to Mihailović that \"in the operation in Prozor we slaughtered more than 2,000 Croats and Muslims. Our soldiers returned enthusiastic\".7 November 2012 According to the historian Jozo Tomasevich, incomplete data shows that 543 civilians were massacred. At least 656 victims have been listed by name, while another source states that about 848 people were killed, mainly \"children, women, and the elderly\". Historian Ivo Goldstein also mentions an estimate of 1,500 victims, and attributes the discrepancy \"to the fact that the estimates refer to different territories\".7 November 2012  \nRoatta objected to these \"massive slaughters\" of noncombatant civilians and threatened to halt Italian aid to the Chetniks if they did not end. He requested that \"Trifunović be apprised that if the Chetnik violence against the Croatian and Muslim population is not immediately stopped, we will stop supplying food and daily wages to those formations whose members are perpetrators of the violence. If this criminal situation continues, more severe measures will be undertaken\". The massacre angered the NDH government and the Italians had to order the Chetniks to withdraw from Prozor. Some were discharged altogether while others were later sent to northern Dalmatia to aid Đujić's forces. Operation Beta later followed in the same month in which the Italians and NDH forces captured Livno and surrounding localities. A month after the massacre, Jevđević and Baćović wrote a self-critical report on Prozor to Mihailović, hoping to distance themselves from the actions of their troops.7 November 2012  \nIn late September or early October 1942, Baćović and Jevđević held talks with Muslim leader Ismet Popovac and agreed to recruit Muslims into the Chetnik ranks. Popovac's Muslim Chetnik militia later fought the Partisans during the Axis-led Case White offensive in early 1943, but did not distinguish itself. By December 1943, an estimated 4,000 (or eight percent) of Mihailović's Chetniks were Muslim.  \nIn October 1942, Baćović issued an appeal to Serb Partisans which blamed the establishment of the Partisan movement on Jews and \"the scum of the earth\". He blamed the Partisans for the destruction of traditional Serb society, religion and morals, claiming that they were corrupting women and the young, and promoting incest and immorality. He further implored Serb Partisans to accept that they were being led by \"Jews, Muslims, Croats, Magyars, Bulgarians\". In the same month, his staff issued a further appeal, claiming that the Serb Chetniks controlled all of Serbia, Montenegro, Sandžak, Herzegovina and most of Bosnia, and that Serb Partisans were to be found only in a few places in Bosnia. He urged Serb Partisans to defect to the Chetniks so that they could return to being \"good Serbs\" and contribute to the creation of a \"free and Great Serb state\". Baćović's bands committed further atrocities against Croats and Muslims in Mostar and Konjic in November.\n\n### Operations in northern Dalmatia and Lika  \nIn November and December 1942, the Italians helped about 4,000 of Baćović's Chetniks in Herzegovina relocate to northern Dalmatia and Lika with another 4,000 to be relocated later. In December, concerned about the possibility of Allied forces landing in the Balkans, the Germans began planning an anti-Partisan offensive in Bosnia and Herzegovina codenamed Case White. The size of the planned offensive required the involvement of both the Croatian Home Guard and the Italians. Late in the planning, the Italians began to prepare and equip Chetnik detachments, including Baćović's, for involvement in the operation. On 8 January, Baćović was conferred the title of vojvoda by the ailing Trifunović-Birčanin, with the nom de guerre of Kalinovički.  \nIn late January 1943, Baćović's forces in northern Dalmatia committed a massacre of Croat civilians in the town of Vrlika, near Split. Following Trifunović-Birčanin's death in February 1943, Baćović, Jevđević, Đujić and Baćović's chief of staff Radovan Ivanišević vowed to continue his policy of closely collaborating with the Italians against the Partisans. On 10 February 1943, a proclamation signed by Baćović, Đujić, Ivanišević and Ilija Mihić was issued. It declared to the people of Bosnia, Lika and Dalmatia that the Chetniks had cleansed Serbia, Montenegro, and Herzegovina of the Partisans, and were about to do the same in their areas. The declaration denounced the Partisans as the \"criminal band of Tito, Moše Pijade, Levi Vajnert, and other paid Jews\". The declaration also called upon the Partisan rank and file to kill their political commissars and join the Chetniks, and claimed that hundreds of their comrades were surrendering to the Chetniks every day because they realised that they had been \"betrayed and swindled by the Communist Jews\".  \nBy 28 February 1943, 2,807 of the 8,137 Chetniks operating in northern Dalmatia as part of the Italian Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia (MVAC) XVIIth Corps were under Baćović's command. In July 1943, Montenegrin Partisan leader Milovan Đilas contacted both Baćović and Ostojić to establish their willingness to work jointly against the Germans and Italians, given that a new Yugoslav government-in-exile was about to be established in London without Mihailović. Baćović and Ostojić reported this contact to Mihailović who threatened to exclude them from his Chetnik organization if they maintained contact with the Partisans.  \n### Anti-Partisan actions in Herzegovina  \nIn March & April 1943 Baćović's troops fight against Partisans in Eastern Herzegovina. Baćović in letter to Chetnik Head Quarters on March 28 notes that Partisans treat Chetnik prisoners of war well and that they don't harm families of Chetnik members following Parisan caputure of Nevesinje. Three days later he sent a report to Draža Mihailović that Chetnik troops have executed 70 Partisan PoWs and houses of runaway communists have been burnt down and their families are imprisoned. On April 3 Baćović reports to Mihailović that he burns down entire villages, executes people every day and that he has 170 prisoners.  \n### Cairo, London and return to Yugoslavia  \n<image>Baćović accompanied Major Vojislav Lukačević to the London wedding of King Peter II of Yugoslavia (pictured).\nIn mid-February 1944, Baćović and Lukačević accompanied Special Operations Executive (SOE) Colonel Bill Bailey to the coast south of Dubrovnik and were evacuated from Cavtat by a Royal Navy gunboat. They then traveled via Cairo to London, where Lukačević represented Mihailović at King Peter's wedding on 20 March 1944. After the British government decided to withdraw support from Mihailović, Baćović and Lukačević were not allowed to return to Yugoslavia until arrangements had been made for the British mission to Mihailović headed by Brigadier Charles Armstrong to be safely evacuated from occupied territory.  \nThe two were detained by the British in Bari, Italy, and thoroughly searched by local authorities, who suspected them of a robbery that had occurred in the Yugoslav consulate in Cairo. Most of the money, jewelry and uncensored letters that they were carrying were impounded. The two were flown out of Bari on 30 May, and landed on an airfield at Pranjani northwest of Čačak shortly after. Because their landing at Pranjani coincided with Armstrong's departure, Baćović and Lukačević demanded that Armstrong be held as a hostage until their impounded belongings could be returned from Bari. The Chetnik personnel at the airfield refused to keep Armstrong any further, and he was allowed to depart without incident.  \nLater that month, Baćović helped organize a Chetnik \"Independent Group of National Resistance\" and wanted to contact British forces who they expected to land in the southern Adriatic coast. On 11 September 1944, Baćović and Ostojić warned Chetnik headquarters that Muslims and Croats were joining the Partisans in large numbers and that Chetniks in Bosnia and Herzegovina lacked food and ammunition. They suggested that Mihailović request an Allied occupation of Yugoslavia or risk losing the war both politically and militarily. They assessed that the population had sensed that the Partisans were now supported by the three major Allied Powers, but that the Chetniks had now been abandoned by them. Baćović had always urged Mihailović to show restraint in his dealings with the Germans and Italians, and often warned Mihailović that he must never be seen openly cooperating with the occupiers.loc=p. 329, note 17 On 20 October 1944, Partisan and Soviet Red Army troops captured Belgrade from the Germans. Soon after the Chetniks lost Serbia, the centre of their movement. After the breakdown of the Chetnik movement in early 1945, Baćović was no longer loyal to Mihailović.\n\n### Withdrawal and death  \nBaćović joined Đurišić's forces in their trek towards the Ljubljana Gap in modern-day Slovenia, alongside Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić, detachments commanded by Ostojić, and a large number of refugees, totalling around 10,000. This force was formed into the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, consisting of the 1st, 5th, 8th and 9th (Herzegovina) Divisions. Earlier, Đurišić and Mihailović had argued over the best course of action. Đurišić had wanted to withdraw through Albania to Greece, but Mihailović had told him to prepare for an Allied landing, the return of the king and the establishment of a national government. From the time Đurišić joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, he was very critical of Mihailović's leadership and argued strongly for all remaining Chetnik troops to move to the Ljubljana Gap. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move there independently of him, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's Serbian Volunteer Corps already there to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement.  \nIn order to get his group to Bihać, Đurišić made a safe-conduct agreement with elements of the Armed Forces of the NDH and with the Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević who was collaborating with them. The details of the agreement are not known, but it appears that he and his troops were meant to cross the Sava River into Slavonia where they would be aligned with Drljević as the \"Montenegrin National Army\" with Đurišić retaining operational command. Đurišić apparently tried to outsmart them and sent only his sick and wounded across the river, keeping his fit troops south of the river. He began moving his command westwards and, harassed by both the NDH troops and Partisans, reached the Vrbas River. In the Battle of Lijevče Field, north of Banja Luka, the combined Chetnik force was defeated by a strong NDH force which was armed with German-supplied tanks.  \nFollowing this defeat and the defection of one of his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his group towards safety. However, this appears to have been a trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. According to Tomasevich, exactly what occurred after his capture is not clear, but Baćović, Đurišić, Vasić and Ostojić were subsequently killed, along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others. According to some sources, on 20 April, Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were taken to the Stara Gradiška prison, near Jasenovac. The Ustaše gathered them in a field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected. They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River, never to be seen again. It is reported that they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself, or in a marsh in its vicinity. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring the Chetniks led by Đurišić. The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević's separatism.\n\nQuestion: Which event is directly associated with the location shown in Image 1?\nChoice list: \nA.

It is located at about 5 km from Krýsuvík and as the name says at the foot of a bigger mountain, the tuya of Geitahlíð.\n\n## Volcanism  \n### Eruption fissures of the Brennisteinsfjöll volcanic system  \nDespite its location, just some 5 km from the high temperature area of Seltún, the volcano and its counterparts, the crater rows, fissures, as well as the tuya Geitahlíð  (385 m) with the crater Æsubúðir  on its top, are not part of the Krýsuvík volcanic system, but of the volcanic system of Brennisteinsfjöll as its southernmost outpost.  \nEldborgir erupted about 2400 BP. The crater row also includes some lava channels. The lava at time of eruption run 2,5 km to the sea.  \n### The pyroclastic cones  \nStóra-Eldborg undir Geitahlíð is a pyroclastic cone, built up mostly from spatter and scoria it forms part of a crater row.  \nAnother such eruption fissure is to be found nearby, therefore Icelanders prefer the plural Eldborgir undir Geitahlíð. One of the eruption fissures dissects the older tuya Geitahlíð.  \nThe Litla-Eldborg crater is part of the parallel crater row and eruption fissure. The eruption products of both fissures are petrologically different when compared. For this reason, it has been thought, that the fissures are not from the same eruption series.  \nLitla-Eldborg regrettablydate=July 2021 is rather damaged by quarrying.  \n### Tuya Geitahlíð  \nThe pyroclastic cones bear their name, because they are located very near to the tuya Geitahlíð (386 m), and one of the fissures even can be seen dissecting the side of the older volcano. The tuya has its origin in subglacial eruptions under a Pleistocene glacier during a cold spell of the Ice Age. A Holocene crater is located up on summit plateau of the tuya which produced the lava field Krýsuvíkurhraun. It entered the sea to the south and formed the upper layers at Krýsuvíkurbjarg.  \n## Fólk tales  \nThe location is connected to the fólk tale about the cousins Krýsa and Herdís. The old women, who could use witchcraft, had a hefty discussion about the borders of their respective lands. One wanted to cast a spell so that all the fish in a nearby lake would be hairy, the other intended to bring up a storm and let all fishermen die. But this did not happen. Instead, the dispute ended with the death of both of them. The fólk tale says that they were buried side by side and the place of the graves is still known to locals.  \n## Nature protection  \nThe crater and its surroundings were placed under nature protection in 1987  as a natural monument inside of Reykjanesfólkvangur.  \n## Hiking  \nThere are some – partially marked - hiking trails on the eruption fissure, up to the rim of the Stóra-Eldborg-Crater and in the vicinity. Reynir Ingibjartsson  also proposes a tour up on the tuya through a small valley behind Stóra-Eldborg to visit the crater up on the tuya and because of the view over all of the south coast of Reykjanes as well as over other parts of Iceland's south coast up to Eyjafjallajökull.\n\nQuestion: Which image shows the scoria from the Eldborgir?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Cory Booker 2020 presidential campaign  \nThe 2020 presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Cory Booker was announced on February 1, 2019. Booker participated in five Democratic presidential debates, but failed to qualify for the sixth debate. He suspended his campaign on January 13, 2020 and later endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden, who went on to win the Democratic nomination and the general election.  \n## Background  \n<image>Booker campaigns in New Hampshire in February 2019.\nIn 2018, Politico identified Booker as part of the \"Hell-No Caucus.\" Along with Senators Harris, Gillibrand, Warren and Sanders, he had voted overwhelmingly against Trump nominees for administration jobs. All five of the Senators in this group were considered potential 2020 presidential contenders.  \nBooker was widely expected to run for president in 2020. His idealistic rhetoric and vocal defense for the rights of black people, women, and LGBT people (groups who tend to belong to the Democratic Party's base) in hearings dating back to 2017 had been seen as positioning for a 2020 run. Booker had openly considered a presidential bid as early as September 2018. He began making trips to early campaign locations in 2018 and early 2019.\n\n## History  \nBooker's 2020 presidential campaign was announced on February 1, 2019, when a video entitled \"We Will Rise\" was posted on Booker's YouTube channel. Booker intentionally chose the first day of Black History Month to announce his candidacy.  \nWithin a month after Booker announced his candidacy, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, and every Democratic member of the House of Representatives from New Jersey endorsed him. Booker held a campaign kickoff rally in Newark on April 13.  \nBooker opened his campaign headquarters in the historic renovated New Jersey Bell Headquarters Building on Broad Street in Newark, New Jersey in March 2019. He launched a two-week campaign tour from there on April 14, 2019.  \nBooker focused much of his campaigning on an effort to win the 2020 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses. On July 5, 2019, Booker hosted a roundtable discussion on immigration in Las Vegas, Nevada, saying the panel consisted \"of folks who are, in my opinion, some of the bright lights in the nation for being activists around issues that are best for our country, issues that represent our values, and, frankly, the issues that are just helping to deal with what I see as a very, very dark period in American history.\"  \nThe Booker campaign did not accept contributions from corporate PACs or federally registered lobbyists. Donations from other political action committees, such as the Environment America organization, were still accepted.  \nBooker's support amongst Democratic voters hovered in the low single digits throughout much of his campaign. After qualifying for the first five Democratic Party presidential debates, he failed to meet the polling thresholds to participate in the sixth debate in December 2019. Booker suspended his presidential campaign on January 13, 2020. He endorsed Joe Biden for president in March 2020.  \n## Political positions  \n### Crime  \nBooker has condemned the War on Drugs, calling it \"a war on people\" and a \"tremendous failure\"; in 2013 he criticized the Obama administration for not honoring state drug laws and raiding medical marijuana dispensaries. He has also expressed support for medical marijuana research, decriminalizing marijuana, ending mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders, increasing funding for prisoner re-entry programs, and bringing an end to for-profit, private prisons. Booker has also cosponsored the bipartisan STATES Act proposed in the 115th Congress by  Warren (Massachusetts) and Gardner (Colorado) that would exempt individuals or corporations in compliance with state cannabis laws from federal enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act. Booker also supports changing discriminatory jail sentencing laws.  \nIn June 2018, Booker joined with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) and Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) to introduce a bill to make lynching a federal hate crime. 16 other Senators signed as co-sponsors, and the bill was supported by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). Between 1882 and 1986, nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced, yet none had passed the Senate until this bill passed unanimously in December 2018, then held at the desk of the House. In February 2019, the Senate backed it with a voice vote.  \n#### Guns  \nBooker has publicly defended the right of law-abiding citizens to own legal fire arms and blames most shootings on criminals with illegal guns. He voted to prohibit people on terror watch lists from buying guns. He co-sponsored legislation with Dianne Feinstein to ban assault weapons. On Parkland shooting's anniversary, he and other candidates urged stricter gun laws. Booker advanced his position in the same month,  \n### Economy  \n<image>Booker speaking with the media after delivering a speech to the California Democratic Party State Convention in 2019.\nIn May 2012, Booker defended Bain Capital's record and criticized Obama's attack on private equity. In response, the Republican National Committee created a petition called \"I Stand With Cory Booker\".  \nBooker is in favor of creating so-called \"baby bonds\", whereby newborns would be given low-risk savings accounts (managed by the Treasury) that would be worth tens of thousands of dollars by the age of 18. According to an analysis by Naomi Zwede of the Center on Social Policy and poverty at Columbia University, the baby bonds would almost entirely close the racial wealth gap among young people.\n\n#### Labor rights  \nBooker supports an increase of the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Speaking to Newark airport workers in May 2017 he said, \"It is un-American to be in this country, to work a full-time job and still live in poverty. That is unacceptable. The minimum wage working at a lot of these contract companies only affords them about $22,000 a year... You cannot live and raise a family on $22,000 a year. You can't afford housing, you can't afford child care and since your company isn't helping you with retirement, you can't save for retirement.\"  \nIn June 2018, Booker was 1 of 8 senators to sponsor a bill amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to include a mandate forcing farmers to pay workers time and a half for each hour worked past the standard 40-hour work week.  \n#### Tech  \nBooker wants to see the tech sector reach its fullest potential, and to do that, he thinks the U.S. government needs to ease up on regulations. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. \"We're being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars...\" Booker said, \"and we cannot get left behind\".  \nIn stark contrast to Warren and Sanders, Booker invites Amazon to set up a major office (nicknamed \"HQ2\") in Newark, New Jersey.  \n### Environment  \nBooker has the most pro-animal welfare Senate-voting record according to the Humane Society. He is vegan and says that planet Earth cannot sustain First World meat-eating habits as prosperity spreads worldwide.  \nBooker backs the scientific consensus on global warming that it is man-made and is in favor of cap-and-trade or a carbon tax for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He backs the Green New Deal:  \nIn September 2018, Booker was 1 of 8 senators (along with Harris) to cosponsor the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, a bill described by Warren as using \"market forces to speed up the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy — reducing the odds of an environmental and financial disaster without spending a dime of taxpayer money.\"  \nIn November 2018, Booker was 1 of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution specifying key findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action toward addressing climate change.  \n### Foreign policy  \nBooker supports scaling down U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and is against intervention in Syria. After the US strike on Syria in April 2017, he criticized military action \"without a clear plan\" or authorization from Congress. He supports a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. On Iran, he has supported the Iran nuclear deal framework and has drawn criticism.  \n<image>Sign at the Women's March on Portland 2017, held the day after the Inauguration of Donald Trump.\n\n\n### Human rights  \nRegarding abortion, Booker opposes overturning Roe v. Wade.  \nBooker termed the President's military transgender ban \"deplorable and despicable\".  \n#### Discrimination  \nBooker advocates same-sex marriage and claimed New Jersey's civil union law was not only bigoted, but also discriminated against New Jersey's same-sex couples who were denied 1,100 federal rights, privileges and benefits afforded to married couples. After Governor Chris Christie vetoed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in New Jersey and said the issue should be left to a public referendum of the people of New Jersey, Booker criticized him and said that civil rights are guaranteed by the US Constitution and should not be allowed on the ballot. As Newark Mayor, Booker refused to perform any weddings until same-sex couples were legally allowed. On October 21, 2013, the date when same-sex marriage became legal, Booker began performing same-sex and opposite-sex weddings.  \nIn November 2013, Booker co-sponsored and voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. In January 2014, he co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act.  \nIn October 2018, Booker was 1 of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBT diplomats who had unions which were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBT individuals \"subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities\" and that the US refusing to let LGBT diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of America upholding \"the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.\"  \nRegarding racism, Booker tweeted that \"Black women are nearly 4 times more likely than white women to die as a result of childbirth\".  \n### Immigration  \nAmong Booker's stances on immigration, he believes immigrant detention should be eliminated to the extent possible. He has written that America needs to guarantee hormone therapy for transgender asylum seekers that have been detained.  \nRegarding immigration detention, a joint  letter dated June 2015 by 33 senators (including Gillibrand, Warren, and Sanders) criticized that as \"unacceptable and goes against our most fundamental values\".  \nIn July 2018, Booker was among 11 senators to sign a letter requesting the agencies responsible for reuniting families provide weekly updates, until every separated child was returned to their parents, in the form of a list of separated children, a list of their parents and other adult members of their families in addition to a list connecting the lists of children and parents and a briefing for the lawmakers on the strategies used to reunite families, and was 1 of 22 senators to sponsor the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act, which if enacted would prohibit immigration officers from detaining pregnant women in a majority of circumstances and improve conditions of care for individuals in custody.  \nIn January 2019, Booker was 1 of 21 senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill imposing a ban on the DHS from passing information collected on DACA recipients to ICE, CBP, the DOJ, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies being investigated.  \nIn a TV interview, he was asked what the people should do,  \nBooker opined that the federal government's inability to construct the Trump wall, for which president Trump declared a national emergency situation, is not an emergency.<image>Booker at a rally opposing the American Health Care Act of 2017\n\n\n### Health care  \nBooker supports holding pharmaceutical companies accountable when they \"gouge folks.\" He co-sponsored a bill that would take away patents if a company raises prices above what other countries are raising, allowing generic drugs to make the drug cheaper. In 2018 that introduced a bill that would \"shine a light into drug company payments to individuals with influence over the types of drugs preferred by states’ Medicaid programs.\" He has been criticized for taking money from pharmaceutical executives and PAC's, accruing almost a half million in donations since 2013.  \n## Endorsements\n\nQuestion: Which policy proposal is associated with the individual in the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

In 1960, five different songs topped the chart, which at the time was published under the title Hot C&W Sides, C&W being an abbreviation for country and western.  Chart placings were based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores.  \nIn the issue of Billboard dated January 4, the song at number one was \"El Paso\" by Marty Robbins, the track's third week in the top spot.  It held the peak position for the first five weeks of 1960, during which time it also topped the all-genre Hot 100 chart for two weeks.  During the remainder of the year, only four other songs reached the top of the Hot C&W Sides listing, three of which each spent twelve or more consecutive weeks at number one.  In the issue of Billboard dated February 8, Jim Reeves began a 14-week unbroken run at the top of the chart with \"He'll Have to Go\", which was immediately followed by a run of the same length by Hank Locklin's \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\".  Both songs were produced by Chet Atkins, widely seen as the originator of the \"Nashville Sound\", a new style of country music which eschewed elements of the earlier honky-tonk style in favour of smooth productions which had a broader appeal.  Cowboy Copas next spent 12 weeks at number one with \"Alabam\". Several singles peaked at number two during these songs' extended runs at the top of the chart, including \"One More Time\" by Ray Price, which spent eight consecutive weeks in second place behind Locklin's song.  \n\"Alabam\" was the first chart-topping single for Copas and marked a comeback in his career, as prior to its success he had not entered the chart at all since 1952.  Nonetheless, it would be the only number one for the singer, who died in a plane crash in 1963.  \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\" was Locklin's first number one since he topped the earlier Country and Western Most Played by Jockeys chart in January 1954, but like Copas he would not return to the top spot, even though he would remain an active recording artist into the 21st century.  The final country number one of 1960 was Ferlin Husky's \"Wings of a Dove\"; although he would continue to chart well into the 1970s, Husky would also not achieve another number one.  Marty Robbins, in contrast, would go on to achieve several more number ones, including 1976's \"El Paso City\", a sequel of sorts to his earlier song.\n\n## Chart history  \n<image>alt=A dark-haired man resting on a guitar\n\n<image>alt=A dark-haired man in a striped shirt holding a guitar\n\n<image>Jim Reeves spent 14 weeks at number one with \"He'll Have to Go\".\n}\n\n\nQuestion: Which artist had a 14-week unbroken run at the top of the Hot C&W Sides chart in 1960 with the song \"He'll Have to Go\"?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Return connecting rod engine  \n<image>Although rare today, this was the original layout for all atmospheric and steam engines. The cylinder sat directly atop the boiler below. Even with the development of separate boilers, it was still considered simpler for access to place the large, heavy cylinder low down and with the lighter cranks above. The form of vertical engine that became more common in later years, with the cylinder facing downwards, was originally termed the 'inverted vertical'.\n\n\n## Table and Steeple engines  \nModel table engine, showing the forked connecting rod  \n'Table' and'steeple' engines are vertical stationary engines with return connecting rods.  \n### Table engines  \nTable engines place the cylinder above and between the crankshaft and the crosshead. They saw widespread manufacture by Maudslay from around 1805 and were used to supply power to small engineering workshops. They were especially popular for driving lineshafting, as they could operate at a higher speed than beam engines.  \nLike the smaller grasshopper beam engines, an advantage for Maudslay's table engines was that they could be made in factories as a complete unit. This included their large cast iron baseplate or table. Unlike horizontal engines and house-built beam engines, they did not require the construction of a large and carefully aligned masonry foundation at the engine's site. Engines could also be made in advance and sold 'off the shelf'. Although this had cost savings, it was mostly beneficial because it was quicker than commissioning the building of an engine and engine house to go with it.  \n### Steeple engines  \n<image>Steeple engine\nSteeple engines place the crankshaft above the cylinder, between it and the crosshead. They use paired piston rods, two or even four, from the piston to the crosshead, to avoid the crankshaft. Another pattern used a triangular yoke on the single piston rod, allowing the crankshaft to pass through it.  \nSteeple engines were mostly used as marine engines. Some American paddlewheel riverboats had especially large steeples that towered over their deckhouse.  \nThe term'steeple engine' was also used later to refer to inverted-vertical tandem-compound engines, owing to their great height.A tandem compound places both high and low pressure cylinders, sometimes even a third intermediate pressure cylinder, in-line on the same piston rod. These were not return connecting rod engines.\n\n## Locomotives  \n<image>Steam Elephant (replica)\nTrevithick's first high-pressure engines from 1801 onwards, including his locomotives, used the return connecting rod layout in both horizontal and vertical arrangements. The cylinders were embedded within the boiler, to avoid heat loss, and the short boiler also formed the frame of the engine. This made the return connecting rod a natural layout, with the crankshaft at the opposite end of the boiler from the  crosshead. The paired connecting rods were relatively simple components, even though two were required. As they also allowed the crankshaft to use two simple overhung cranks on the ends of the shaft, rather than a complex forged crankshaft with an internal crank, this was also a valuable simplification.  \nOther early steam locomotives such as Murray's Salamanca (1812) and George Stephenson's Blücher (1815) and Locomotion (1825) also used return connecting rod engines. These all had heavy vertical cylinders set in tandem within the boiler barrel, driving through transverse crossheads above the locomotive, supported by swinging links. The complexity of this motion led to it being named  'the knitting'  by drivers. The swinging link was simpler than Watt's earlier parallel motion and did not constrain the crosshead to move in such an accurate straight line. However the additional length of the connecting rods for a return connecting rod engine, relative to the piston stroke, made this angulation effect less serious. The Steam Elephant used a rudimentary set of slidebars to support the crosshead instead.  \nThe use of a return connecting rod to a shaft beneath the boiler with overhung cranks also avoided the need for an internal crank. For Stephenson's designs, this crank axle would also have carried the locomotive's weight, not being merely a crankshaft, and so this avoided a particularly difficult piece of forging work.  \nOne of the last locomotives to use return connecting rods was Ericsson and Braithwaite's Novelty at the Rainhill trials.  \nAbandonment of return connecting rod designs  \nHedley's Puffing Billy, a contemporary of Blücher, avoided the return connecting rod in favour of a grasshopper beam. The cylinders were now mounted side by side, but were still large, heavy and mounted as an integral part of the boiler. Although a beam engine has a similar layout to a return connecting rod engine, in that the piston rod points in one direction and the connecting rod runs backwards from this, beam engines are not considered as return connecting rod engines. Stephenson's manager Hackworth's locomotive Royal George inverted the design to having the cylinders, still vertical, face downwards directly onto the crankshaft. By the time of Stephenson's Rocket, particularly as the new fire-tube boiler locomotives became lighter and faster, it was recognised that vertical cylinders caused hammer blow on the flimsy fishbelly rails of the time. Rocket was built with cylinders inclined at 45° but was soon rebuilt to place them near-horizontally. Since then, almost all steam locomotives have had their cylinders placed close to horizontal.\n\n## Marine steam engines  \n### Paddle ships  \nCrosshead (\"square\") engine of the Hudson River steamboat PS Belle  \nThe first marine steam engines drove paddlewheels. Paddles require a relatively high axle, that often also forms the crankshaft. For stability the main weight of the engine, i.e. its cylinder, is mounted low down. Later engines drove single screw propellers. These now required a low-mounted drive, but still benefited from the stability effect of a low-set engine. Such early engines, constrained by the technology of the time, worked at low boiler pressures and slow piston speeds. Together with the short piston stroke constrained by lack of space for the engine,efn-lr|American sternwheel paddlesteamers used longitudinal horizontal engines that allowed a long stroke. These developed as long, small diameter engines of a distinctly different pattern from any other marine engines. In contrast, American sidewheel paddlesteamers favoured particularly tall upright steeple or walking beam engines. these early engines required large diameter pistons in order to develop enough power.  \n#### Crosshead engines  \nCrosshead, 'double crosshead' or'square' engines were vertical engines analogous in layout to the table engine, with their cylinder above the crankshaft. The crosshead needed to be very wide, to allow the connecting rods to pass either side of the large cylinder, which in turn required a large supporting frame for the slidebars. They were popular for early American riverboats and their large wooden A frame crosshead supports were a distinctive feature. Larger engines became top-heavy and so the design was replaced by steeple or walking beam engines.  \n#### Steeple engines  \nEuropean practice, particularly on the Clyde, favoured Napier's steeple engine instead of the square engine. These were more complicated to construct and used more ironwork, but they placed the cylinder beneath the crankshaft and so were more stable in a narrow hull. Neither form was popular for sea-going vessels.  \n### Screw propulsion  \nIn marine practice, the return connecting rod engine for screw propulsion was termed the back-acting(US parlance)  \nor double piston rod engine.  \n#### Trunk engines  \nJohn Penn patented the trunk engine in 1848. This was a design to allow a particularly short engine (measured in the direction of its piston rod), that was also able to support a large diameter piston.A prevalent theory at the time was concerned about the effects of wear on the pistons of horizontal engines, owing to the weight of the piston. Pistons were thus provided with extensive support from their piston and tail rods, rather than allowing any weight to rest directly on the cylinder wall. They were mounted transversely, usually as two cylinder engines, and used for naval ships with relatively high installed power. A trunk engine achieves its short length by having a large diameter, hollow piston rod or 'trunk'. The gudgeon pin of the connecting rod is mounted inside this trunk, allowing the overall length of the two man components, the piston rod and connecting rod, to be telescoped together. As the trunk must be large enough to allow for the angulation of the connecting rod as the crank rotates, this design is limited to large diameter engines. It was also found that as boiler pressure increased, the large diameter seal around the trunk was increasingly prone to leaking.  \n#### Double piston rod engines  \n<image>Double piston rod engine of screw-driven 1865Cylinder and piston are to the right, condenser and air pump to the left.\nThe trunk engine was largely replaced by the double piston-rod engine.  This was a return connecting rod engine, with the crankshaft between the crosshead and cylinder. Four piston rods were used to pass around the crankshaft, both above and below, and also to each side of the crank, as the crank throw was wider than the vertical spacing of the piston rods. As most of these engines were parallel compounds, two piston rods would be taken from each of the HP and LP pistons. In some engines, double rods were used from the large LP cylinder and a single rod from the HP cylinder, with a yoke to pass around the crankshaft. Double piston rods could also be used from a simple engine, but these required an overhung gudgeon pin on the crosshead, so tended to be limited to smaller engines. An advantage of the double piston rod engine over the trunk was that both ends of the connecting rod were accessible for maintenance. One factor learned from naval use of horizontal cylinders was that, despite previous fears, there was little additional wear owing to the piston's weight resting on the cylinder.  \nAn Admiralty committee of 1858 recommended strongly that older engine designs be abandoned in favour of rationalisation on only three designs: the single piston rod engine (the most recognisable type today), the trunk engine and the double piston rod.  \nA later variant of the trunk engine re-visited the return connecting rod layout as the vibrating lever or half-trunk engine. This was a paired engine with two short-stroke trunk engines facing outwards. Their connecting rods from the pistons led to upright 'vibrating levers' that could rock back and forth. These levers rotated a short axle shaft with further levers on it that in turn drove another pair of connecting rods and a shared central crankshaft. These complex engines were the invention of the Swedish-American engineer John Ericsson and were little used outside these two countries.\n\n#### Maudslay's siamese engine  \nOther compact alternatives to the return connecting rod or trunk engines were Maudslay's siamese enginepage=96 and the rare annular piston engine. Like the trunk engine, these placed the gudgeon pin within the length of the piston stroke by having a pair of pistons and a T-shaped crosshead that could relocate the gudgeon pin behind its usual position.  \n### Builders  \n* Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes (later named Humphrys, Tenant & Co)  \n* Maudslay  \n* Penn  \n## Directly coupled pumps and blowing engines  \n<image>Vertical blowing engine\nA blowing engine is a large stationary steam engine directly coupled to air pumping cylinders. They are used to provide the air blast for blast furnaces and other forms of smelter. As the working cylinder and the driven load are both reciprocating pistons, they may be directly coupled by their piston rod. The connecting rod is only used to drive a flywheel whose inertia balances load through the cycle of the engine, not as an output shaft. These engines were some of the last new return connecting rod designs to be built.  \nThe large vertical blowing engine illustrated was built in the 1890s by E. P. Allis Co. of Milwaukee (later to form part of Allis-Chalmers). The air pumping cylinder is above the steam power cylinder and crosshead. The main force of the piston is transmitted to the air cylinder by a purely reciprocating action and the flywheels are there merely to smooth the action of the engine. The flywheel shaft is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards.  \nSimilar pumping engines were also used in waterworks. Inverted vertical engines had their cylinder at the top and water ram pumps at their base, or in a borehole below them. A crankshaft and flywheels were provided in the space between these, for smoother running rather than rotary power output. These were driven from the lower (pump) yoke, by short return connecting rods. Two Worth McKenzie engines of this type; a triple-expansion engine on 1895 and a duplex simple of 1906 were installed at the Waterworks Museum, Hereford, Hereford and are preserved in steam there.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following images shows a steam engine layout where the cylinder is placed directly atop the boiler, as was the original layout for atmospheric and steam engines?\nChoice list: \nA.

She also has an older brother who also played volleyball.  \nWhen she entered college, she was offered a scholarship by the director of the Holy Spiritual Women's Junior College, in return for playing volleyball for the school. Ebata has said that this was a major turning point for her. She was then attached to the Holy Spiritual Women's Junior College, she was active in the Spring High Valley and Inter – high as captain.date=October 2018  \n### Personal life  \nOn August 2022, She married Shun Takahashi who is the coach of the women's volleyball team Victorina Himeji.  \n## Career  \nIn 2008, she was recruited by the Hitachi Rivale professional women's volleyball club team as one of their active wing spikers in 2009–10. In 2010, she was registered as one of the representatives of Japan women's national volleyball team at the 2010 World Grand Prix making her the youngest player in the team. In addition, during the World Championship in October–November of the same year, she scored 24 points for Japan in their second match of the qualifying round against Turkey on November 7, which is also her birthday.  The team went on to win the bronze medal, her performance made a big contribution for the team.  \nIn June 2011, at the 2011 Montreux Volley Masters, she contributed greatly to her first win with the team against Turkey, due to her great performance, she won the Best Spiker award in the said tournament. Meanwhile, in the 2011 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup, she contributed to Japan's victory as an ace and at her young age, she leads Japan to a 4th-place finish.  \nIn March 2012, she contributed to the victory of Hitachi Rivale in the V. Challenge League, eventually winning the MVP award. In the same year, she participated in the 2012 London Olympic games alongside the Japanese women's volleyball team. She showed great success in her hitting throughout the games and particularly in the quarter-finals against China where she scored her all-time highest with 33 points. Ebata helped earn the team a place in the semi-finals after a  5 set win over China. Japan eventually lost the semi-finals against Brazil, however, went on to take the bronze medal match sweeping all 3 sets over South Korea. The Japanese women's volleyball team had earned their first Olympic medal in 28 years since the Los Angeles 1984 bronze medal win.  \nIn February 2013, she was appointed as the brand ambassadress of the local regional bank of Akita.  \nOn July 24, 2014, Hitachi Rivale announced the transfer of Ebata to RC Cannes women's professional volleyball club team. The transfer date happened on September 1, 2014.  \nOn June 1, 2015, PFU BlueCats of the V Challenge League announced the joining of Ebata on the club. She is currently playing on the team.  \nShe announced her retirement after Season 2020/21.  \n## Playing style  \nAs a wing spiker, she mainly plays on the opposite side.

This list shows singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 1996, as well as singles which peaked in 1995 but were in the top 10 in 1996. The entry date is when the single appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced).  \nOne-hundred and ninety-five singles were in the top ten in 1996. Nine singles from 1995 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year. \"I Am Blessed\" by Eternal was the only single from 1995 to reach its peak in 1996. Forty-nine artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1996. Backstreet Boys, The Chemical Brothers, Faithless, Lighthouse Family and Spice Girls were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1996.  \nThe 1995 Christmas number-one, \"Earth Song\" by Michael Jackson, remained at number-one for the first two weeks of 1996. The first new number-one single of the year was \"Jesus to a Child\" by George Michael. Overall, twenty-four different singles peaked at number-one in 1996, with Spice Girls (3) having the most singles hit that position.\n\n## Background  \n### Multiple entries  \nOne-hundred and ninety-five singles charted in the top 10 in 1996, with one-hundred and eighty-seven singles reaching their peak this year.  \nForty-nine artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1996. Boyzone, Celine Dion, Eternal, Manic Street Preachers, Mark Morrison and Michael Jackson shared the record for the most top ten singles in 1996 with four hit singles each. Two of Boyzone's singles reached number-one: the Bee Gees cover \"Words\" in October and their album title track \"A Different Beat\" in December. The other hits were \"Father and Son\", which reached number 2 at the end of 1995, and \"Coming Home Now\", which charted at number 4 in March. Another all-male group, Manic Street Preachers from Wales, had four top ten singles, with the highest charting \"A Design for Life\" reaching number two in April. Of the other artists, Michael Jackson had a number-one hit with \"Earth Song\"; Celine Dion peaked at number 3 with \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\"; Mark Morrison reached number-one with his signature-song \"Return of the Mack\" and Eternal's biggest hit was \"Someday\", which peaked at number 4.  \nGina G was one of a number of artists with two top-ten entries, including the number-one single \"Ooh Aah...Just a Little Bit\". The Beautiful South, Cast, Jamiroquai, Mariah Carey and Suede were among the other artists who had multiple top 10 entries in 1996.  \n### Chart debuts  \nSeventy-nine artists achieved their first top 10 single in 1996, either as a lead or featured artist. Of these, eight went on to record another hit single that year: Ash, Backstreet Boys, Dr. Dre, Faithless, Garbage, Gina G, Sleeper and Terrorvision. 3T, The Bluetones, Cast, Fugees, Kula Shaker, Ocean Colour Scene and Robert Miles all had a second single make the top ten. Mark Morrison had three other entries in his breakthrough year.  \nThe following table (collapsed on desktop site) does not include acts who had previously charted as part of a group and secured their first top 10 solo single.  \nNotes  \nPeter Andre made his top 10 debut with his own single, “Mysterious Girl”, one of three top ten singles in 1996, but the previous year he was part of the Childliners collective who reached number 9 with “The Gift of Christmas”. Goldbug included Richard Walmsley who was a former member of Beatmasters, the production team who debuted in 1987 with \"Rok da House\". U2's Adam Clayton had appeared on a track outside the group before, the Band Aid charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas\" in 1984. However his collaboration with fellow U2 member Larry Mullen Jr. on \"Theme from Mission: Impossible\" was his official solo top 10 debut.  \nWink previously charted under the name Josh Wink but a shortened version was used for the \"Higher State of Consciousness\" remix. Backstreet Boys appeared on \"The Gift of Christmas\" charity single in 1995 but \"We've Got It Goin' On\" was their first entry as a group. Acting and singing duo Ant & Dec had previous chart credits under the name PJ & Duncan, including debut single \"Let's Get Ready to Rhumble\".  \nRobbie Williams had left Take That in 1995 and his debut solo single arrived this year, a cover of \"Freedom! '90\" by George Michael, renamed as \"Freedom\" and peaking in second spot. Former bandmates Gary Barlow and Mark Owen both launched solo careers in 1996 after the group went on hiatus - Barlow's \"Forever Love\" topped the chart, with Owen's \"Child\" reaching number 3.  \nDunblane was formed by survivors of the massacre at Dunblane Primary School, with Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits playing guitar on the track. Scottish musician Ted Christopher wrote an extra new verse to \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" honouring the tragedy.  \n### Songs from films  \nOriginal songs from various films entered the top 10 throughout the year. These included \"The X-Files\" (from The X-Files), \"Theme from Mission: Impossible\" (Mission: Impossible), \"Born Slippy.NUXX\" (Trainspotting), \"Woman\" (The Long Kiss Goodnight), \"You Must Love Me\" and \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" (Evita) and \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" (Police Story 3: Super Cop).  \n### Charity singles  \nIn the aftermath of the Dunblane massacre, a school shooting in Dunblane, Scotland which claimed the lives of sixteen children and their teacher, surviving students and teachers recorded a tribute single, which included a cover of \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" (which included an extra verse specially written by Ted Christopher) and a new song \"Throw These Guns Away\". It peaked at number-one on 21 December 1996 (week ending) for a single week.  \n### Best-selling singles  \nFugees had the best-selling single of the year with their cover of \"Killing Me Softly\", which spent eleven weeks in the top 10 (including five weeks at number-one), sold over 1.3 million copies and was certified 2× platinum by the BPI. \"Wannabe\" by Spice Girls came in second place. Babylon Zoo's \"Spaceman\", \"Say You'll Be There\" and \"2 Become 1\", both by Spice Girls, made up the top five.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# José Luís Mena Barreto  \nJosé Luís Mena Barreto (24 October 1817 – 10 October 1879) was an army officer, politician and monarchist of the Empire of Brazil. He came from a wealthy family with a tradition of military service. José Luís entered the army in 1836, during the Ragamuffin War, a secessionist rebellion. The conflict lasted for almost ten years, and he fought in several military engagements at that time.  \nJosé Luís held several positions during the years following the end of the Ragamuffin threat in 1845. His most important posting was command over the cavalry unit that served as Emperor Dom Pedro II's personal guard in the national capital, Rio de Janeiro. He also fought against the Argentine Confederation in the brief Platine War, which lasted from 1851 until 1852. In 1864, he led one of the two divisions which comprised the Brazilian army in the Uruguayan War. During that conflict, he led the initial invasion of Uruguay and fought in two crucial engagements that resulted in the capture of two Uruguayan towns.  \nIn the Paraguayan War, José Luís fought in most of its decisive campaigns. He was severely wounded during one battle and was left disfigured. Despite having served from 1864 until 1870 as a successful field commander, José Luís was repeatedly passed over in promotions and was not awarded a title of nobility. After the war, he held bureaucratic positions in military units before settling in the highly prestigious post of military commander of his native province, Rio Grande do Sul. He was also a politician and member of the Liberal Party. José Luís was seen by contemporaries and, after his death in 1879, by historians as a brave and able field commander.  \n## Early years  \nJosé Luís Mena Barreto was born on 24 October 1817 in Porto Alegre. The town was the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, a southern captaincy (later province) of the Kingdom of Brazil, which at that time was politically united with Portugal. His parents were José Luís Mena Barreto and Ana Emília da Silveira Sampaio. José Luís belonged to a wealthy family of Portuguese descent and military background, who owned ranches and large cattle herds. The family had a long history of participation in the colonial wars fought with Rio Grande do Sul's Hispanic-American neighbors.  \nIn 1822, José Luís' family declared for Prince Dom Pedro (later Emperor Dom Pedro I), the leader in the struggle for Brazilian independence which eventually gave rise to the Empire of Brazil. In July 1823, José Luís' father, his uncle and his paternal grandfather (Field Marshal João de Deus Mena Barreto, later Viscount of São Gabriel), openly sided with Pedro I in his struggle with the Constituent and Legislative General Assembly that had been elected to draft a Constitution. The General Assembly punished the men by removing José Luís' father and uncle from their military commands and by ordering them to leave Rio Grande do Sul. His grandfather was barred from entering Porto Alegre.  \nJosé Luís' family did not fully comply with the orders. They settled in Rio Pardo, a town in Rio Grande do Sul. After Pedro I dissolved the Constituent Assembly in late 1823, the Emperor rewarded the Mena Barreto and lifted the penalties imposed upon them. Little more than a year later, the neighboring province of Cisplatina rebelled and attempted to secede from Brazil in what became the Cisplatine War. On 24 September 1825, José Luís' father died fighting against rebel forces during the Battle of Rincon, leaving him an orphan at age 7.  \n## Early military career  \n### Ragamuffins rebellion  \n<image>Porto Alegre, capital of Rio Grande do Sul province, seven years after the end of the Ragamuffin War\nOn 20 September 1835, a civil war that became known as the Ragamuffin War erupted in Rio Grande do Sul. The rebels, called Ragamuffins, conquered most of the province, including its capital, Porto Alegre. On 15 June 1836, Major Manuel Marques de Sousa (a loyalist officer, later made Count of Porto Alegre) retook Porto Alegre by surprise. Both soldiers and civilians participated in the town's recapture, and among these was the 18-year-old José Luís. Marques de Sousa handed over the command of the loyalist forces to José Luís' elderly grandfather, Army Marshal João de Deus Mena Barreto, the town's highest-ranking officer. José Luís joined the army as 1st Cadet in the 2nd Regiment of Light Cavalry.  \nJosé Luís fought in small battles on 30 June and 20 July against Ragamuffins forces besieging Porto Alegre, and he saw action again on 6 September near the town of Capela Grande (today's Viamão). In 1837, he fought in further engagements: on 10 January near the town of Rio Pardo and on 25 June and 29 September near Porto Alegre. He was promoted to alferes (modern-day second lieutenant) on 28 August 1838. On 2 December 1839, José Luís was transferred from the 2nd Regiment to the 3rd Regiment of Light Cavalry and raised to lieutenant (modern-day first lieutenant).  \nThe imperial forces slowly regained ground, and by the early 1840s, the Ragamuffins were on the run. José Luís was promoted to brevet (acting) captain on 7 May 1842, and this commission was made permanent on 23 July 1844. After the war ended in March 1845, he was transferred to the 5th brigade and raised to major. On 23 December, he was moved to the 3rd brigade.\n\n### Platine War  \nIn the years that followed, José Luís remained in the 3rd brigade. He was given a leave from 8 January 1848 until 8 May. He was next appointed to a bureaucratic position charged with administrative duties for the 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry on 23 May. José Luís received a promotion to brevet major on 30 August 1849. In January 1850, he marched to Bagé, and later to Quaraim, to maintain order after a series of disturbances broke out in those regions. Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation, declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The government in Rio de Janeiro had prepared against the threat and formed an anti-Rosas alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay (former Cisplatina) and dissident Argentine provinces. A Brazilian army crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. The 4th Regiment was of Light Cavalry part of this expedition, serving under the 1st Division. The Brazilians were victorious, and José Luís was rewarded with confirmation in the rank of major on 19 June 1852.  \nOn 15 July 1854, José Luís was promoted to lieutenant colonel and transferred to the 1st Cavalry Regiment, which served as Emperor Dom Pedro II's personal guard in the national capital, Rio de Janeiro. He became the regiment's interim commander from 22 February 1855 until 1 August. Upon leaving that position, he was praised by the Emperor for his organizing and leadership skills as head of the unit. José Luís requested permission to study in the Military College and take its cavalry course, but in February 1856, his request was declined. It was considered inappropriate to have a lieutenant colonel studying among cadets. José Luís was promoted to colonel on 2 December, receiving the command of the 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry, and was stationed to Rio Grande do Sul. On 14 March 1858, he was assigned command over the Jaguarão frontier (a military district in Rio Grande do Sul). On 3 July 1860, he was transferred to the command of the São Borja frontier, where he remained until 1862.  \n## Southern wars  \n### Invasion of Uruguay  \n<image>A church heavily damaged during the siege of Paysandú, 1865\nOn 15 February 1864, José Luís was given a four months leave to treat his health. He returned to active duty and was raised to the rank of brigadier on 29 July. A few months later, in October, he received orders to invade Uruguay at the head of a brigade composed of one infantry battalion and two cavalry corps. Another civil war had erupted in Uruguay between its Blanco Party and Colorado Party. The internal conflict led to the murder of Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. The Brazilian government decided to intervene and mobilized an army. Brazil expected José Luís' small force to begin operations while its main army was being brought up to full strength.  \nJosé Luís' brigade began its advance on 12 October 1864. Two days later, near the Brazilian town of Jaguarão, the force invaded Uruguay's Cerro Largo Department. The Blancos attacked the Brazilian force during its march in several skirmishes, but was unable to prevent its progress. On 16 October, the brigade entered Melo unopposed. The town was the capital of Cerro Largo and had been abandoned by the Blancos. The brigade withdrew to rendezvous with the main army on 24 October, after handing over control of Melo to the Uruguayan Colorados. A few days previously, on 20 October, Brazil's Vice-Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then-Baron of Tamandaré) had formed a secret anti-Blancos alliance with Uruguay's Brigadier General Venancio Flores, leader of the Colorados.  \nOn 1 November 1864, José Luís was appointed commander of the 2nd Division in the main Brazilian army, which by then was called the \"Army of the South\" and led by his uncle Field Marshal João Propício Mena Barreto (later Baron of São Gabriel). The Army of the South invaded Uruguay on 1 December. José Luís took part in the siege of the Uruguayan town of Paysandú, which fell on 2 January 1865. The Brazilian army and the allied Colorados force then besieged the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo. Before any attack upon the city could be launched, the Blancos capitulated, ending the conflict.\n\n### War against Paraguay  \nThe Battle of Potrero Sauce, 18 July 1866  \nAn unintended consequence of the attack on Melo was that Paraguay declared war on Brazil in late 1864. The Paraguayans invaded the provinces of Mato Grosso (present-day Mato Grosso do Sul) and Rio Grande do Sul. José Luís served in the Siege of Uruguaiana which resulted, in September 1865, in the surrender of an entire Paraguayan army which had taken the Brazilian town of Uruguaiana. On 22 March 1866, José Luís was given command of the 2nd cavalry division, a part of the 1st army corps. He fought in the Battle of Estero Bellaco on 2 May and in the First Battle of Tuyutí on 24 May. At Tuyutí José Luís was shot in the face with the bullet's trajectory entering one cheek and exiting through the other. He was left with hideous scars that made him look like he had a grim smile in his face. Tall and lean, José Luís seemed unpleasant at first glance, an impression that the disfigurement only worsened. He was actually a kind and warm person, according to historian Gustavo Barroso, who as commander knew how to impose a strict discipline without hurting the pride of his subordinates.  \nJosé Luís later fought in the Battle of Boquerón and the Battle of Potrero Sauce on 16 and 18 July 1866, respectively. He was transferred to the 1st cavalry division on 19 January 1867. He fought in the Battle of Tuyú Cué on 31 July, in the Battle of San Solano and in the Battle of Paré-Cué (part of the operations to encircle the Humaitá fortress) on 3 October. He was moved from the 1st cavalry division to the 3rd cavalry division on 12 October. He participated in the 28 Oct. 1867 Battle of Potrero Obella.  He also fought in the Second Battle of Tuyutí on 3 November. After the fall of Humaitá in July 1868, José Luís took part in the Pikysyry maneuver that resulted in the Dezembrada (Deed of December), a series of decisive victories over the Paraguayans. At the head of the 2nd army corps after 6 December, José Luís fought in the Battle of Avay, in the Battle of Lomas Valentinas and in the Battle of Angostura.  \nDespite his having fought and gained victories in many battles from the war's outset, José Luís was not awarded with any promotion or title of nobility, except for receiving a few, minor chivalric orders. The Brazilian Commander-in-chief, Army Marshal Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then-Marquis of Caxias), had a very low opinion of José Luís and considered him an incompetent officer. Caxias' view was not shared by other general officers, many of whom openly supported José Luís and praised him as a capable field commander. José Luís fared better under Caxias' successor, Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, who held him in high regard. During the last stage of the war, in which he commanded the 1st army corps, José Luís fought in the Battle of Piribebuy and in the Battle of Acosta Ñu in August 1869.  \n## Later years and death  \nOn 10 April 1871, more than a year after the Paraguayan ended, José Luís was promoted to field marshal (present-day divisional general), the third-highest rank in the Brazilian army (below lieutenant general and army marshal). He was appointed on 24 April 1872 to the bureaucratic position of inspector of army units stationed in the provinces of São Paulo, Santa Catarina and Espírito Santo. On 27 August, he became the inspector of the army units in Rio Grande do Sul. José Luís remained in that position until 4 May 1878, when he was named military commander of Rio Grande do Sul, a highly prestigious post.  \nIt is known that José Luís was also a member of the Liberal Party. It was common during the Empire of Brazil for high-ranking military officers to pursue political careers while on active duty. José Luís was first married to his cousin Maria Francisca Mena Barreto. After her death, he married Rita de Cássia de Oliveira Melo, with whom he had daughters and one son, João de Deus Mena Barreto (who as divisional general would play a key role in the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 that led to the rise of Dictator Getúlio Vargas).  \nJosé Luís died in Porto Alegre on 10 October 1879, while still serving as military commander over his native province. He was given solemn funereal honors. Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay, Viscount of Taunay said that José Luís \"had much bravery, beyond competence in arms\" and was a good tactician who remained unshakably calm in battles. Historian Gustavo Barroso regarded him a valorous and brave officer, the member of the Mena Barreto family who had most distinguished himself through his own merits.  \n## Honors  \n### Non-titled nobility honors  \n* Commander of the Brazilian Order of Christ.  \n* Commander of the Brazilian Order of the Rose.  \n* Dignitary of the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross.  \n* Commander of the Brazilian Order of Saint Benedict of Aviz.  \n### Military honors  \n* Medal of the army in the Oriental State of Uruguay in 1852.  \n* Medal of Paysandú.  \n* Commemorative medal of the surrender of the division of the army of Paraguay that occupied the village of Uruguaiana.  \n* Medal (oval) of merit \"due to military bravery\" (1868).  \n* Medal awarded to the army, armada and to civil servants in operations in the Paraguayan War (1870).\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a location that José Luís was directly involved with during a military conflict?\nChoice list: \nA.

This included saying that the Azerbaijani army was strong and disciplined as opposed to that of Armenia and that \"the situation in the Armenian armed forces is disastrous. In case of war the troops of this country will escape from the field of battle.\" He also told the European Union that his country would support liberating its lands peacefully but he emphasized that Azerbaijan reserves the right to liberate \"its occupied lands\". This came at the same time as E.U. Special Representative for the South Caucasus Philippe Lefort congratulated him on his appointment.  \nDuring the 2016 April War, Hasanov stated that if shelling of Azerbaijani settlements by Armenian forces did not cease, Azerbaijan would consider launching an artillery bombardment on Stepanakert.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Infrastructure policy of Donald Trump  \nThe infrastructure policy of Donald Trump included ensuring U.S. energy independence, safeguarding the cybersecurity of the national power grid and other critical infrastructure, locking China out of the U.S. fifth-generation Internet market, and rolling back regulations to ease the process of planning and construction. While there were no major infrastructure spending packages, some individual policies and projects were advanced piecemeal, especially in rural areas.  \nAlthough there was recognition of the need to upgrade American infrastructure from both sides of the political aisle, no major infrastructure bill was passed due to disagreements over the details of such a spending package, namely, what to spend on, how much to spend, and how to pay for it. In general, the aim of the Trump administration was to revitalize the national economy and enhance national security, despite the tendency of the Republican Party to oppose large federal expenditures and tax hikes. Members of the opposition Democratic Party typically favored investing in renewable energy and new infrastructure that could combat climate change.  \n## Views, vision, and standards  \nAs early as May 2015, one month before launching his presidential campaign, Donald Trump expressed his desire to fix America's aging infrastructure, making it \"second to none.\" He expressed concern about the state of American infrastructure on multiple occasions, drawing comparisons with other countries. For example, he stated that American passenger trains were slow compared to those in China and American airports to be dirty and dilapidated next to their counterparts from China, Saudi Arabia, or Qatar. He acknowledged that modernizing American infrastructure was going to be expensive but argued that in the end, such an investment would pay for itself. In this regard, his position is in line with that of the Democratic Party. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had themselves been advocating for more federal infrastructure spending.  \nOn January 31, 2019, Trump issued an executive order encouraging the purchase of U.S.-made construction materials for public infrastructure projects, especially those that need funding from the federal government. This followed his 2017 \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order restricting the hiring of foreign workers and tightening standards for federal acquisitions. As of February 2019, Canadian officials were negotiating an exemption for their country.  \nIn August 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration issued guidelines on what it considered to be \"critical infrastructure workers.\" Such individuals include those in the communications, energy, transportation, and water management sectors.  \n## Environmental reviews of infrastructure projects  \nIn April 2019, President Trump signed two executive orders intended to accelerate energy infrastructure projects. The first makes it harder for oil pipelines and other energy projects to be delayed due to environmental concerns. The second modernizes the approval process for projects crossing international borders. Speaking in front of union workers from the energy industry, the President stated that blocking energy projects \"does not just hurt families and workers like you, it undermines our independence and national security.\"  \nIn early January 2020, the Trump administration proposed revisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that would relax environmental regulations on infrastructure constructions in order to speed them up. Federal agencies would no longer have to take climate change into account when assessing major infrastructure projects and would have to complete their comprehensive environmental reviews in two years. Infrastructure projects that require federal permits but little federal funding are exempt from such reviews. Nor would new projects have to account for \"cumulative\" effects.  \nIf the proposed revisions survived their legal challenges, environmental activists would no longer be able to halt pipeline construction by litigation, a key tool they have been using since the middle of the Obama administration. While there have been examples of bureaucracy being burdensome on building projects in the past, such a drastic change would likely invite even more lawsuits. After 60 days of public hearing, a final regulation can be expected, probably before the 2020 Presidential election. In July 2020, the President announced the changes at a UPS hub in Atlanta, Georgia. He chose this location specifically because the revisions will expedite the expansion of the Interstate 75, frequently used by truck drivers and often congested. Previously, the State of Georgia announced it would create two additional lanes just for commercial trucks, and in the Fall of 2019, before Trump announced his revisions, said it was shifting the date of completion to 2028.  \nIn June 2020, the President signed an executive order providing federal agencies with the emergency power to fast-track infrastructure projects, including energy and highway construction, by overriding environmental regulations. The Departments of Agriculture, the Interior, and Defense were to accelerate projects on federal lands. The White House claimed this was to help the U.S. economy recover from the downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, the Environmental Protection Agency invoked the pandemic to ease regulations of power and industrial plants.  \n## Funding efforts  \n### 2017-19  \nMore infrastructure spending was Trump's most popular promise in his presidential campaign, with approval from two thirds of Americans. In his first speech as President-elect, Trump vowed to \"begin the urgent task of rebuilding\" the United States of America.  \nTrump presented an infrastructure plan to Congress in February 2018, with $200 billion in federal funding and projected it would result in $1.5 trillion of investments from the private sector. Democrats opposed this plan because of its emphasis on state and local funding and private investments. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle also questioned where the money would come from. By September 2019, as signs of a possible recession appear over the horizon, Donald Trump could use, among other things, infrastructure spending to tackle the problem like his predecessors did, albeit at the cost of more public debt as tax hikes are generally unpopular. However, because interest rates are low, public debt is not as troublesome, especially if additional debt is used to finance investments that could boost growth, such as in infrastructure.  \nIn his 2019 State of the Union address, Trump once again called for investments in infrastructure, but offered very few specifics. Moreover, his vision made little headway because despite bipartisan agreement that American infrastructure is in a state of poor repair and needs upgrading, members of Congress have not been able to reach a consensus on how to pay for it. The problem of aging infrastructure cannot be addressed by the individual states because the costs are too high, meaning the federal government has to be involved. The federal tax on fuels, a major source of revenue for infrastructure spending, remains the same as it was in 1993, at $0.183 (~$ in US-GDP) per gallon ($0.048 per liter).  In addition, the Highway Trust Fund is losing its effectiveness thanks to improving energy efficiency and the arrival of alternative-fuel vehicles whose owners do not have to pay the gas tax. Although people who attended a meeting with Trump in February 2018 suggested that the President was open to the idea of raising the gas tax to $0.25 per gallon ($0.066 per liter), the White House downplayed possibilities of such a tax hike. According to the Chamber of Commerce, which backs the proposal, it would generate about $375 billion over ten years.  \nPresident Trump held a meeting with top Democrats in Congress, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, on April 30, 2019, but failed to strike a deal. He wanted Congress to first pass the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), the newly negotiated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to stop investigating him and to remove the threat of impeachment. He also wanted a package with automatic re-authorization of highway and transit funding rather than a broader plan with money for a variety of items from hospitals to broadband Internet.  \n### 2020  \nWhile Republicans have generally been skeptical of Democrats' proposals to finance massive infrastructure programs by debt, in late March 2020, as lawmakers ponder how to alleviate the severe economic downturn induced by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, they seem to have coalesced around the need to upgrade American infrastructure and create jobs. President Trump publicly endorsed this possible deal as the next phase of the federal response to the pandemic. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin told CNBC the President would like to take advantage of low interest rates to finance this potential bill. The Democrats' infrastructure plan includes funds for passenger rail transportation – with money for Amtrak's stations and services –, ports and harbors, climate-change resiliency, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and expanding access to broadband Internet. A different plan passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously in July 2019; it would allocate $287 billion over five years, $259 billion of which to maintain and repair roads and bridges. President Trump mentioned this second plan in his 2020 State of the Union Address.  \nTrump indicated he would like to go further than this Senate plan. In late March, he voiced his support for a potential \"Phase 4\" stimulus package worth two trillion dollars of infrastructure spending. He called it \"Phase 4\" because there were previously three stimulus bills aimed at mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Earlier in the year, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin discussed a possible infrastructure plans with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal, but their talks were derailed as the pandemic continued to spread across the United States. In order for such a spending package to be passed, lawmakers from across the political spectrum would need to be able to overcome long-standing disputes over what to spend on, how much money to spend, and where the money comes from, because the term 'infrastructure' is quite broad and means different things specifically to different people. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy both expressed skepticism of the need for a fourth stimulus package in a row, saying they would like to wait and see the effects of the three packages already passed first.  \n## Disaster relief  \nIn early June 2019, President Trump signed a disaster relief and recovery bill worth $19 billion (~$ in US-GDP). The Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act of 2019 includes $3 billion (~$ in US-GDP) for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to repair damages inflicted by natural disasters in the previous three years and to invest in resiliency and flood protection, unlocks $8.9 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and offers an additional $900 million to help the territory recover from Hurricane Maria. This bill also provides additional resources to the U.S. Forest Service for wildfire suppression activities. Some $1.6 billion is allocated to repairing roads and bridges post-disaster through the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Fund.  \nThe Act also provides financial assistance to the U.S. Marine Corps base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, which sustained $3 billion worth of damages by Hurricane Florence.  \nIn early July 2020, President Trump approved federal aid going to Missouri after the state was battered by severe storms in early May. Preliminary estimates suggest repairing all the infrastructure damage could cost $9.3 million. Missouri Governor Mike Parson said federal money would fund the repairs and replacements of electrical power equipment, roads, bridges, and other public works.  \n## Energy  \n### Electrical power grid  \nIn late June 2017, about a week after cybersecurity experts realized that a piece of malware used to attack Ukraine's power grid the previous year could, with modifications, be used against the United States, President Trump met with cabinet officials, leaders from the energy sector, cybersecurity experts to discuss the threat. The federal government identifies energy infrastructure, mostly owned and operated by the private sector, as critical, and the Department of Homeland Security cooperates with the private sector to ensure its security. Using an executive order issued in May 2017, President Trump ordered, among other things, an investigation on America's preparedness against a cyber attack resulting in prolonged power outages.  \nIn late April 2020, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at protecting the U.S. national power grid against foreign cyber attacks. \"A successful attack on our bulk-power system would present significant risks to our economy, human health and safety, and would render the United States less capable of acting in defense of itself and its allies,\" he wrote. This executive order bans the purchase and installation of equipment manufactured outside the United States. In addition, it tasks the Secretary of Energy, Dan Brouillette at the time of its issuing, with creating a list of safe vendors, identifying any vulnerable components of the grid and replacing them. In 2018, then Secretary of Energy Rick Perry created the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) to combat cybersecurity threats to the U.S. power supply. While the U.S. has not witnessed any destructive cyber attacks on its power grid yet, foreign actors have conducted reconnaissance operations on this infrastructure. In January 2020, the FBI notified grid operators about the vulnerabilities in their software supply chain.  \n### Energy independence  \nPresident Donald Trump's position with regards to energy independence is similar to that of his predecessors dating back to the 1970s. His Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, argued that \"An energy dominant America means self-reliant. It means a secure nation, free from the geopolitical turmoil of other nations who seek to use energy as an economic weapon.\"  \n### Fossil fuels  \nShortly after taking office in 2017, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, thereby fulfilling a campaign promise. He said he wanted a \"fair\" deal that would not undermine U.S. workers and businesses, or compromise U.S. national sovereignty. President Trump announced the formal United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017. He has also been rolling back Obama-era environmental regulations ever since, including the Clean Power Plan.  \nIn January 2017, President Trump signed an executive order reviving the Dakota Access Pipeline, bringing oil from shale reserves in North Dakota to refineries in Illinois along a route 1,172 miles (1,887 km) long.  \nIn March 2017, the Trump administration approved the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, reversing a decision by the Obama administration and fulfilling a campaign promise.  \nIn January 2018, the Interior Department announced plans to allow drilling in nearly all U.S. waters. This would be the largest expansion of offshore oil and gas leasing ever proposed, and includes regions that were long off-limits to development and more than 100 million acres in the Arctic and the Eastern Seaboard, regions that President Obama had placed under a drilling moratorium.  \nIn late May 2019, the Department of Energy rebranded natural gas as \"molecules of freedom\" which it sought to export worldwide. The announcement was made during the expansion of a facility in Quintana Island, Texas, that produces liquefied natural gas. This expansion is expected to bring 3,000 jobs to the area. In general, there is no difference between the export policy of the Trump administration for liquefied natural gas and that of the Obama administration.  \nAt an event in Salt Lake City, Utah, Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced that the Trump administration is committed to making fossil fuels cleaner rather than imposing \"draconian\" regulations on them. He said the administration wanted to invest in the research of development of ways to reduce emissions as demand for coal drops and that for natural gas rises. Perry pointed to efforts already underway to replace old and inefficient coal power plants and to use more liquefied natural gas. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. emissions fell by 13% between 2005 and 2017.  \n<image>Donald Trump at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 2017.\nIn June 2019, the Trump administration introduced a new rule on coal power plants' emissions, requiring electric utilities to cut their emissions to 35% below 2005 levels by 2030. It authorizes the setting up of targets for improving efficiency by state regulators and does not require switching from coal to other energy sources. This new rule replaces the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which established specific carbon-emissions reduction target for each state. However, according to the International Energy Agency, the U.S. electricity sector would need to reduce its emissions by 74% below 2005 levels over the same period in order to prevent the global average temperature from rising by more than 2 °C. Nevertheless, utilities are already moving away from coal as the costs of alternatives become increasingly competitive.  \nThe Trump administration is selling leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil companies for drilling. Although environmentalists oppose the project, saying that it damages the landscape and harms the caribou and birds that migrate there, some native Alaskans living in the area support the move. While infrastructure there is rather limited, residents receive their paychecks from the oil industry drilling in Prudhoe Bay, which also pays for a full-time fire department and a basketball gym. They also have flush toilets, which do not exist in villages outside the Refuge. However, after a lease sale, an oil company will need to first drill some test wells to see if there is a significant amount of oil in the area, and if they find it, they need environmental reviews and permits before they can extract it.  \nCheap and abundant energy has fueled the revival of American manufacturing. However, steel tariffs from the Sino-American trade war also increased the cost of pipeline construction and other equipment.\n\n### Nuclear energy  \nIn 2017, President Trump announced his administration was launching a \"complete review\" of ways to revive and expand the nuclear power industry. Energy Secretary Rick Perry also noted the importance increasing the use of nuclear energy, calling it \"a very important part\" of the Trump administration's energy strategy.  \n### Renewable energy  \n#### Background  \nThe Trump administration generally prefers fossil fuels to renewable energy. In fact, Trump has made his support for the coal industry clear, so much so that his electoral victory in 2016 was celebrated by the coal mining community.  \n#### Hydro  \nIn November 2017, the Northern Pass transmission line project, proposed by utilities company Eversource to carry hydroelectricity from Quebec to New England, received a presidential permit. For years, New England has been shedding its coal power plants, and the process continues under President Trump. However, in July 2019, the New Hampshire Supreme Court unanimously upheld the state's Site Evaluation Committee rejection, citing concerns over the land use, environmental and economic impacts of the 192-mile (307-km) transmission line.  \nIn January 2018, President Trump said he would like the United States to harness more hydropower. However, it is not clear whether he would like to increase hydropower generation or he was unaware of how much hydroelectric dams contribute to the national grid. In any case, while the Energy Information Administration does not expect U.S. hydroelectricity generation to increase in the upcoming years, it is possible to upgrade the turbines of existing facilities as the average U.S. hydroelectric unit has been operating for 64 years. In addition, most dams in the U.S. are not for power generation, but can be fitted with turbines.  \n#### Solar  \n<image>Solar irradiation map of the U.S. mainland in kWh/m2 in 2014.\nEven though President Trump holds critical views of renewable energy in general and solar in particular, his appointees in the Department of the Interior have been facilitating the development of multiple renewable energy projects in public lands. In May 2020, the Trump administration gave final approval to the Gemini Solar Farm project in Nevada. Worth a billion dollars, it includes 690 MW of power-generating capacity and 380 MW of four-hour lithium-ion batteries. It is enough to power 260,000 households and offset the greenhouse-gas emissions of 86,000 cars. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt said it would also create 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, and pump $712.5 million into the economy. Gemini, scheduled to enter service by the end of 2023, is the largest solar farm project ever approved in the United States and one of the largest in the world. Opponents argued that the project puts a number of endangered species, such as the Mojave desert tortoise, at risk. Previously, two solar farms on public lands were approved: the Sweetwater Project (80 MW) in Wyoming and the Palen Project (500 MW) in California.  \nIn 2018, as part of the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, Trump imposed tariffs on imported solar cells. The push for tariffs to protect American manufacturing and jobs in the solar power industry began in April 2017, when a bankrupt Georgia-based solar cell maker filed a trade complaint that a flood of cheap imports put them at a severe disadvantage. In response, the President imposed 30% tariffs of solar imports in January 2018. The solar industry is currently one of the fastest growing in the United States, employing more than 250,000 people as of 2018. On one hand, these tariffs forced the cancellation or scaling down of many projects and restrict the ability of companies to recruit more workers. On the other hand, they have the intended effect of incentivizing domestic manufacturing. Many solar power companies are transitioning towards automation and consequently will become less dependent on imports, especially from China.  Analysts believe Trump's tariffs have made a clear impact. Without them, the manufacturing capacity for solar cells in the United States would likely not have increased significantly, from 1.8 gigawatts in 2017 to at least 3.4 gigawatts in 2018, they argue. However, because of the increasing reliance on automation, not that many new jobs will be created, while profits will flow to other countries, as many firms are foreign. By 2019, the solar power industry has recovered from the initial setbacks due to Trump's tariffs, thanks to initiatives from various states, such as California. Moreover, it is receiving considerable support from the Department of Energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) launched the American-made Solar Prize competition in June 2018 and has handed out tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash prizes for the most promising solar cell designs. Prices of solar cells continue to decline. At the same time, the cost of installation has fallen by 70% between 2009 and 2019. Solar power can now go head to head against even natural gas. (A federal tax credit from 2006 has also been helpful.) Thanks to economic forces, the United States is now the second largest market for solar power, after China, and utility-scale projects are booming across the American Southeast.\n\n#### Wind  \nalt=Despite Trump's fondness for coal, his administration was not entirely hostile to renewable energy. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke wrote in an op-ed for the Boston Globe that he wanted to provide \"an equal opportunity for all sources of responsible energy development, from fossil fuels to the full range of renewables.\" He added that \"wind energy — particularly offshore wind — will play a greater role in sustaining American energy dominance.\" Zinke wanted to assist developers by allowing them to postpone decisions on detailed designs during the planning process so that they could take advantage of newer technologies. Offshore wind power is steadily picking up steam in the United States with numerous projects being pursued on both coasts of the country.  \n## Federal public buildings  \nIn February 2020, President Trump proposed an executive order mandating \"classical\" architecture—including Gothic, Romanesque, Spanish, Mediterranean and other traditional styles—for all federal public buildings in the District of Columbia. Trump, the National Civic Art Society, a driving force behind the proposed executive order, and Utah Senator Mike Lee hold a dim view of more modern architectural styles, such as Brutalism, which proved popular during the 1950s but has largely fallen out of favor. These styles have been used in most federal buildings from the 1950s onward. However, the draft executive order singled out the Federal Courthouse in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, completed in 2011, for praise. On the other hand, the American Institute of Architects opposed it. Although they agreed that classical styles are \"beautiful,\" they argued that modern building designs must take into account security, new technology, and efficiency. He signed Executive Order on Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture in December 2020 that would only apply to federal courthouses, agency headquarters, and other government buildings in the National Capital Region, plus any other federal buildings costing more than $50 million in 2020 values. President Joe Biden repealed it in February 2021.  \n## Telecommunications  \n### Cybersecurity of critical infrastructure  \nIn May 2017, President Trump signed an executive order urging federal agencies to upgrade their antiquated information technology (IT) infrastructure, to draw up plans for coordinated defense, and to comply with cybersecurity standards introduced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The order also tackles workforce training in order to provide the United States with a \"long-term cybersecurity advantage.\" For his administration, cybersecurity is a priority because a cyber attack on critical infrastructure could inflict \"catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security, or national security.\" Addressing cybersecurity was a 2016 campaign promise from Trump. However, given that three quarters of the federal budget for IT goes to the operating and maintaining legacy systems, additional funding might be necessary.  \n### High-speed Internet  \nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai.  \nAfter thinking for a year, President Donald Trump came out against having nationalized fifth-generation wireless internet infrastructure (5G). Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai said this sent an \"important signal\" to private companies that were investing billions of dollars in 5G. Pai also proposed spending $20.4 billion over a decade on rural broadband Internet services. Since November 2018, the FCC has been auctioning megahertz of spectrum to commercial wireless internet service providers offering 5G connectivity. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said this was a step in the right direction and suggested that the Commission should not leave out \"mid-band\" spectrum lest the U.S. falls behind other countries. While previous generations of wireless internet offer the ability to send texts, static images, voice, and video through the Internet, 5G is considerably faster, allowing for high-quality video streaming, driverless cars, automated ports, remotely-controlled industrial robots, among other things. South Korea and the United States won the global 5G race when they began rolling out their services in early April 2019. Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Corp, Sprint Corp, and T Mobile US Inc have already begun implementing 5G equipment in a number of American cities with plans to gradually expand service as 5G-compatible phones become more widely available. However, a combination of the high capital costs and high debt levels of leading U.S. telecommunications firm could result in a slow deployment of 5G networks, allowing subsidized Chinese equipment to penetrate markets in Asia and Europe.  \nPresident Trump made the above announcement as he was considering banning Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from the U.S. market. His administration had already been discouraging U.S. allies from purchasing Huawei's 5G technology out of security concerns. His administration believed that Huawei equipment puts intelligence sharing at risk. Since March 2018, the FCC has considered barring the use of federal funds to purchase equipment from companies that could pose a threat to national security. By law, companies operating on Chinese soil must \"support, cooperate with and collaborate in national intelligence work.\"  \nFounded in 1987, Huawei has since become a leading telecommunications firm, spending 14% of its revenue on research and development each year between 2016 and 2018. However, it has been mired in multiple controversies involving alleged intellectual property theft and espionage. After an 11-month investigation, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee found in 2012 that Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese firm, were threats to national security and recommended that U.S. companies refrain from doing business with them.  Under Donald Trump, the U.S. government has been trying to dissuade companies and other governments from around the world from using Huawei's technologies. In May 2019, the Trump administration added Huawei to the \"entity list,\" which prevents it from acquiring technology from American firms without approval from the U.S. government. In October 2019, President Trump met with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinisto, to discuss alternatives to 5G technology from Huawei. Finland's technology giant Nokia has developed some 5G capabilities of its own, and is one of Huawei's chief competitors, alongside Sweden's Ericsson. In December 2017, telecommunications firms from around the world agreed upon a set of global standards for 5G so that the technology can be easily implemented. The race was on for the various equipment manufacturers for global dominance, including Huawei and ZTE from China, Nokia, Ericsson, Qualcomm and Intel (both from the U.S.). 5G is a key part of the geopolitical fault lines created by Donald Trump's desire to \"make America great again\" and China's stated goal of becoming a global hegemony in artificial intelligence by 2030; this technological race is a part of the U.S.-China trade war.  \nIn June 2020, the Trump administration formally announced its opposition to the construction of a new undersea Internet cable connecting Hong Kong with the United States, citing national security concerns. U.S. government officials worried that such a connection would allow Chinese intelligence direct access to U.S. data, boosting their capabilities at a time when China is making no secret of its global ambitions. Adam Hickey, a senior official from the Department of Justice on telecommunications, told Politico, \"It has the potential to establish Hong Kong as the center of gravity for U.S. data connectivity in Asia, offering unprecedented opportunities for collection by the Chinese intelligence services.\" While it is ultimately the FCC that will decide whether to approve the project, it frequently defers to an inter-governmental agency called Team Telecom. In a report, Team Telecom officials wrote, \"By combining personnel data with travel records, health records and credit information, China’s intelligence services may have the capability to create in just a few years a database more detailed than any nation has ever possessed about one of its rivals.\" According to Google, the Hong Kong-U.S. data link will be 12,800 km (8,000 miles) long and will be able to accommodate 80 million teleconference calls between Hong Kong and Los Angeles. It is part of the wider Pacific Light Cable Network project—backed by Google itself, Facebook, and other companies. Pacific Light also has portions connecting the U.S. with Taiwan and the Philippines, both of which received the green light from Team Telecom. This development occurs in the backdrop of deteriorating Sino-American trade relations, with President Trump vocally criticizing China for unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft, China's imposition of a new national security law in Hong Kong, viewed by the U.S. as a threat to the Special Administrative Region's autonomy, and the COVID-19 global pandemic, which began in China and has fueled anti-Chinese sentiments among the American public.  \n### Telehealth  \nIn late March 2020, President Trump signed into law a stimulus package worth around two trillion dollars, the biggest in American history, in order to alleviate the economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Besides cash infusion for front-line hospitals, loans for struggling industries, aid for farmers, enhanced unemployment benefits, relief for married couples with young children, and tax cuts for retailers, it included $200 million for telemedicine. This would help doctors examine their patients remotely, using video-conferencing technology. At present, the FCC operates a rural healthcare program that subsidizes the use of telecommunications technology. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai personally requested this aid in early March. Early that month, the President signed a bipartisan bill that extended Medicare coverage to include telemedicine in outbreak areas. Previously, it was restricted to rural residents who had to take long trips to see a doctor. Telemedicine reduces the need for travel, and therefore chances of vulnerable senior citizens catching COVID-19.  \n## Transportation  \n### Canals, ports, and harbors  \nPort of Savannah with intermodal yard at the top (February 2016)  \nCharleston Harbor, South Carolina, regularly hosts ships traveling through the recently expanded Panama Canal. South Carolina is also home to many manufacturing plants belonging to various multinational corporations, such as the automaker BMW, the tire maker Michelin, and many others. Works to deepen it to 52 feet (15.8 m) has been ongoing since 2011 but had never been on a federal budget proposed by the President till 2018, when a new cost-benefit analysis conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made it suitable for consideration. President Trump allocated $138 million (~$ in US-GDP) to the project in his budget in 2019. Dredging started in 2018, and the State Ports Authority, which operates Charleston Harbor, said it planned to complete the project by 2021, in time for a new container terminal to open. Upon completion, it will be the deepest shipping channel in the East Coast of the United States.  \nThe America's Water Infrastructure Act, signed into law by President Trump in October 2018 authorizes $6 billion (~$ in US-GDP) in spending. Potential recipients for federal funding include the Houston-Galveston Navigation Channel Extension ($15.6 million), and the Ala Wai Canal project in Hawaii ($306.5 million). This bill includes a five-year \"Buy American\" provision, which requires the use of American-made construction materials used by projects funded by the Act.  \nThe Port of Savannah, Georgia, is a busy shipping channel and the fourth largest in the United States. Worth almost a billion dollars, work has been underway since 2016 to deepen the harbor from 42 feet (12.8 m) to 47 feet (14.3 m) in order to accommodate heavier cargo ships taking advantage of the expanded Panama Canal to travel to and from the Eastern United States. At present, such ships are already visiting the Port, but they cannot carry their full loads at low tide. Cargo volumes to the Port of Savannah reached four million containers in 2017. If work goes one as scheduled, the deepening project is expected to be largely finished in 2022. As of 2020, the State of Georgia has already committed $300 million (~$ in US-GDP) to the project, but federal funding is needed. Although President Trump's budget proposals are unlikely to make much headway in a divided Congress that must sign off federal spending packages, due to a ban on earmarks to prevent lawmakers from adding pet projects to federal budgets, anything supervised by the Army Corps of Engineers is usually funded at the level requested in budget proposals. In 2019, despite funding cuts to the Corps, the Port of Savannah received the full $130.3 million requested by Trump while In 2018, it received $186 million. For his 2020 federal budget proposal, President Trump requested $86 million (~$ in US-GDP) for the project.  \n### Civil aviation  \nSome airlines are spending their own money on airport facilities. Pictured: An American Airlines Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner at LAX.  \nShortly after taking office in 2017, Donald Trump unveiled an infrastructure plan worth a trillion dollars that includes a $2.4 (~$ in US-GDP)-billion cut to federal transportation programs. This plan would eliminate subsidies for long-distance trains and commercial flights to rural communities with limited transportation options, including those that helped Trump win the presidency. He wanted to relieve the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of air traffic control and to turn it into a private nonprofit corporation.  \nIn June 2019, the FAA announced it was giving out $840 million in grants for improving airport facilities and President Trump proposed $17.1 billion in funding for the FAA. Trump's proposal made it through the House Appropriations Committee with $614 million more than requested. Therefore, the FAA had $17.7 billion to spend. Airport Improvement Programs (AIP) funds will go to over 380 airports in 47 states. One of the biggest grants is worth $29 million, which goes to runway reconstruction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in Alaska. In addition, the House Appropriations Committee announced $3.3 billion in AIP grants to be handed out in 2020, plus $500 million for discretionary airport infrastructure spending.  \nSome airliners themselves have been financing airport capital projects on their own. For example, American Airlines and Delta have committed $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, to modernize the facilities they use at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Delta allocated another four billion dollars to the construction of a new terminal at the LaGuardia International Airport in New York City. At the same time, a number of airports are willing to spend money on their own facilities in order to reap the long-term economic benefits. In May 2019, the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) announced it would spend some $3.5 billion on a new terminal and on renovating an existing terminal for American Airlines, which uses the airport as one of its main hubs in the U.S.  \nIn early 2020, American airports saw their passenger numbers plummet due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. To help them cope with the crisis, the Trump administration provided $10 billion in financial aid with Congressional approval.  \n### Public transportation  \nIn 2018, the Trump administration rolled out an infrastructure plan that allocates one quarter of the money available to rural areas, even though only 14% of Americans live there. This spells trouble for numerous large-scale urban projects and undermines aging transit networks in large established cities such as Chicago or New York City, which need significant funds for repairs, maintenance, and modernization, because it favors new construction. left  \nThe Gateway Program is a plan to modernize railroad infrastructure between New York and New Jersey and to double the number of trains passing between those two states. This plan includes repairs to the old North River Tunnel, and the construction of the new Hudson Tunnel.  \nAlthough he was initially in favor of the Gateway Project, Trump later turned against it and urged fellow Republicans to cut funding for it. Moreover, he dismissed the project as a local one that lacks national importance and a potential boondoggle. He subsequently cut money from the funds for the Gateway Program. While supporters of the Gateway Project argue that it is one of the nation's most pressing infrastructure needs, opponents are wary of additional federal spending and the fact that money will be taken away from smaller projects for their districts.Groundbreaking ceremony for Maryland's Purple Line in August 2017.  \nFederal funding for smaller projects, such as $900 million for the Washington Metro's Purple Line, was approved. However, Trump's infrastructure spending plan stalled due to from Democrats who took issue with the fact that Trump preferred private funding and highways to federal funding and public transit. Of the projected $1.5 trillion, the federal government would spend only $200 billion. Under the Obama administration, funding for transit on one hand and for highways and bridges on the other hand were roughly equal. Under the Trump administration, some 70% of the funding would go to highways and bridges and only about 11% to transit.  \nIn February 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom reduced the scale of the California High-Speed Rail project, from mi linking Los Angeles to San Francisco down to mi between Merced and Bakersfield, in response to spiraling costs. The State of California estimated the cost of Phase I of the project to be $77 billion, up $13 billion, but warned that the total cost could reach $100 billion. In fact, the project has been mired in cost overruns and delays. Moreover, even though it was initially planned to have one third of the funding from the private sector, the project failed to raise any funds from that source. In May 2019, the Trump administration cancels $929 million (~$ in US-GDP) in funding for the construction of the railway, whose trains could travel at speeds of up to mph. In a statement, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) wrote that the California High-speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) \"has failed to make reasonable progress on the Project\" and \"has abandoned its original vision of a high-speed passenger rail service connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles, which was essential to its applications for FRA grant funding.\" As of June 2019, the project found itself under investigation for financial malpractice. However, in July 2019, the Trump administration authorized the State of California to assume responsibility for ensuring the project is in compliance with federal environmental protection regulations, thereby lifting a major hurdle.  \nIn June 2019, the FRA announced $326 million (~$ in US-GDP) in funding for rail infrastructure upgrades for 45 projects in 29 states. These grants come under the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement (CRISI) Program, authorized by Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, and the Special Transportation Circumstances Program. One third of that amount will go to rural areas.  \nIn early April 2020, the Trump administration issued $25 billion (~$ in US-GDP) in emergency funding for public transportation networks across the United States facing a precipitous drop in ridership due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approved a week prior by Congress, the money would go primarily to densely populated urban areas, including $5.4 billion for New York City, $1.2 billion for Los Angeles, $1.02 billion for the District of Columbia, $883 million for Boston, $879 million for Philadelphia, $820 million for San Francisco and $520 million for Seattle. Meanwhile, some $2.2 billion would go to rural areas, the FTA announced. National passenger rail company Amtrak received a billion dollars.  \n## Water management  \nIn October 2018, President Trump signed into law the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, allocating more than $6 billion (~$ in US-GDP) on water infrastructure spending of all kinds. This bipartisan bill authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to manage water resource projects and policies nationwide. It also authorizes federal funding for various water infrastructure projects, including the expansion of water storage capabilities, and upgrades to wastewater, drinking and irrigation systems. This bill includes some $2.2 billion (~$ in US-GDP) for a coastal barrier Texas, protecting it from flood in the future. The coastal barrier includes not just flood walls and sea walls but also pumping stations, drainage facilities, and floodgates for highways and railroads. The money may also be used for ecosystem repair, upgrades to port and inland waterways, flood control, dam renovations, and enhancing drinking water facilities. Moreover, the Act reauthorizes the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act loan program.  \nIn April 2019, after signing two executive orders on energy infrastructure projects, President Trump said he would order the Environmental Protection Agency to issue guidelines for state compliance with the Clean Water Act.  \nIn May 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made $2.6 billion available for water infrastructure improvement across the United States. According to the Agency's own estimates, some $743 billion is needed, and the State Resolving Funds (SRFs), which require states to match federal funding and repay loans and interests, have provided $170 billion.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately reflects a policy or action taken during the Trump administration as depicted in the provided images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Future Nostalgia  \nFuture Nostalgia is the second studio album by English and Albanian --> singer Dua Lipa, released on 27 March 2020 by Warner Records. Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as Jeff Bhasker, Ian Kirkpatrick, Stuart Price, the Monsters & Strangerz, and Koz to create a \"nostalgic\" pop and disco record with influences from dance-pop and electronic music, inspired by the music that Lipa enjoyed during her childhood.  \nThe album spawned six hit singles, along with the title track as a promotional single. \"Don't Start Now\" was released on 31 October 2019, as the album's lead single, attaining both critical and commercial success. The song peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. \"Physical\" and \"Break My Heart\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively, both reaching the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Hallucinate\" and a remix of \"Levitating\" featuring DaBaby were released as the fourth and fifth singles on 17 July and 1 October 2020, respectively; the latter earned the album its second top-two single on the Hot 100 and the third top-ten of Lipa's career, following \"New Rules\" (2017), and would go on to become the most played song of 2021 in the United States.  \n\"Love Again\" was released as the sixth single in France on 11 March 2021 and globally on 4 June 2021. The album was originally scheduled to be released on 3 April 2020 but was moved forward after leaking in its entirety two weeks earlier. To promote the album, Lipa embarked on the Future Nostalgia Tour, which commenced in February 2022 after being postponed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nUpon its release, Future Nostalgia received universal acclaim from music critics, many of whom praised the production, its cohesion and Lipa's stylistic evolution. Commercially, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and reached the top ten in thirty-one countries. In the United Kingdom, it peaked atop the UK Albums Chart for four non-consecutive weeks, becoming her first album to do so as well as garnering her first-ever nomination for the Mercury Prize, and earning the Brit Award for British Album of the Year. At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, Future Nostalgia was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Pop Vocal Album, whilst \"Don't Start Now\" was nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.  \nFuture Nostalgia was succeeded by its remix album, Club Future Nostalgia, released on 28 August 2020 which received positive reviews from the critics. A French edition of Future Nostalgia was released on 27 November 2020, which yielded the single \"Fever\" which became the longest charting single in France. A reissue of the album, subtitled The Moonlight Edition, was released through Warner on 11 February 2021, along with its lead single, \"We're Good\".  \n## Background  \nAfter the release of Dua Lipa: Complete Edition in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of Lipa's debut album, and the single \"Swan Song\" in January 2019, released in promotion of Alita: Battle Angel (2019), Lipa confirmed that she was working on a new album. In October 2019, Lipa began teasing the album as a new \"era,\" before clearing her social media later that month to announce the lead single, \"Don't Start Now\". Lipa stated that she cleared her social media in order to prove to herself that social media wasn't real, that one could post and choose to use platforms any way they wanted. She further elaborated that she wanted to start fresh with her new album, but she would always have her memories. Whilst promoting \"Don't Start Now\", Lipa confirmed that she would be announcing the album in late November or early December 2019, along with the release of the title track.  \nOn 1 December 2019, Lipa revealed the album title through a tattoo on her left bicep with the title, Future Nostalgia, while also announcing its accompanying arena tour of the same name and that the album would be released in 2020. The following month, three songs (\"Physical\", \"Break My Heart\", and \"If It Ain't Me\", an unreleased collaboration with Normani) leaked online in a security breach. Shortly after on 29 January 2020, Lipa announced that the album would be released on 3 April of that year. The following day, the track list was revealed and the album was made available for pre-order. In late March, the entire album leaked and the release was brought forward by a week to 27 March 2020. Lipa additionally expressed her concern about releasing the album during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n## Concept  \n### Cover artwork  \nThe cover artwork of Future Nostalgia was shot by French photographer, Hugo Comte, who also handled the creative direction and the photographs associated with the album's campaign, with Guillaume Sbalchiero handling the design. It was shot on 13 November 2019, and Lipa revealed it on 29 January 2020, along with the album's release date announcement. During shooting the promotional photography, Comte had one song on repeat for each shot to get Lipa in the mood for him to get the right shot.  \nThe cover artwork of Future Nostalgia features Lipa in a Googie-esque retro vehicle, one that could be seen in the Pulp Fiction (1994) 1950s-themed restaurant scene. A dark sky with a blue moon, which was a stylistic choice, appears behind her. Lipa wears a 1950s-style button-down pink shirt, which is tied in a knot around her waist. Her accessories include gold hooped earrings, with a normal one in one ear and a misshaped one in the other, and numerous rings. She also wears long white gloves, which she holds the steering wheel with. Lipa has her blonde and brunette hair up in a bun.  \n### Title  \nLipa originally intended to call the album Glass House. After working on the album for nearly a year, Lipa came up with a new album title, Future Nostalgia, while on the way to a radio show in Las Vegas around the time of the 2018 American Music Awards. After figuring it out, Lipa messaged her A&R, in which they responded that it's like a baby name, they couldn't tell anyone. She wanted to create a record with the nostalgic memories of her childhood and the music her parents listened to and put a modern spin on it with futuristic elements, which is why she ultimately went with the title. It is meant to describe \"a future of infinite possibilities while tapping into the sound and mood of some older music.\" \"Glass House\" was later used as a lyric in the album's title track.  \n## Recording  \nLipa began work on Future Nostalgia in January 2018 and finished in November 2019. However, during the first year of production, she was still promoting her first album on the Self-Titled Tour and was still figuring out the direction she wanted to go in. Lipa had begun thinking of ideas for the album before Dua Lipa was released in June 2017. After figuring out the album's title, she worked backwards figuring out the sound and lyrical content she desired. She challenged herself to break out of her comfort zone to make music that could sit alongside her favourite classic pop songs, being inspired by Gwen Stefani, Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Moloko, Blondie, and Outkast. After touring, Lipa aspired to have a more live element on the record, mixed with a modern electronic production, but to still have the pop sensibility of her first record. Lipa thought that her sound had \"naturally matured.\"  \nThe majority of the album was recorded in a nine-month period after figuring out its title, where she had sessions every day, including ones at Geejam Studios in Jamaica. Lipa recorded upwards of nearly 60 songs for the album, including unreleased collaborations with producers Max Martin, Nile Rodgers, Mark Ronson, and Pharrell Williams, as well as a collaboration with Normani titled \"If It Ain't Me\", and \"Bad To You\", a song with Ariana Grande. \"Bad To You\" was later released by Grande, Normani, and Nicki Minaj on the Charlie's Angels: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack after Lipa and Grande were unable to finish their respective parts due to scheduling conflicts.  A planned collaboration with Katy Perry titled \"Ball & Chain\" was also canceled due to scheduling issues. Another song that was intended for the album, but did not make the cut, \"Retrograde\", was later recorded by Aleyna Tilki and released as her debut English-language single. Lipa's single \"Un Día (One Day)\" with J Balvin, Bad Bunny, and Tainy was revealed to be recorded during sessions for Future Nostalgia.  \n## Music and lyrics  \nFuture Nostalgia is a dance-pop, electropop, nu-disco, pop-funk, and synth-pop record, with several 1980s and retrofuturism tropes, and elements of Eurodance, hi-NRG, house, techno, and R&B. Described by Lipa as a \"nostalgic\" pop record that \"feels like a dancercise class,\" she took inspiration from the music of the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s to create a sound that felt familiar and brand-new at the same time. The album's structure includes sticky-sweet choruses, and catchy pop hooks, while it has campy productions, consisting of funk bass guitars, electronic beats, rubbery basslines, robotic vocoder backing vocals, chunky synths, lush strings, percolating drums, house-influenced piano chords, and disco strings. The album has themes of the transformative nature of romance, sex, inequality, empowerment, self-possession, the exploration of vulnerability, falling in love, breaking up, vulnerability, equality, hope, flirtation and affection.  \nCritics notes similarities between the tracks on Future Nostalgia and the works of Blondie, Chic, Daft Punk, Lady Gaga, Gloria Gaynor, Debbie Harry, Jamiroquai, Madonna (Confessions on a Dance Floor, 2005), Kylie Minogue (Fever, 2001), Moloko, Olivia Newton-John, No Doubt, Outkast, Prince, and Nile Rodgers. Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic described the sound of Future Nostalgia as \"'70s disco, '80s dance-pop, and '90s club jams.\" In her review for The Independent, Helen Brown stated that Lipa \"channels the zingy, electro-ambitions of the 1980s with remarkable freshness.\" Pitchforks Anna Gaca viewed it as \"a collection of sophisticated, hard-bodied pop-funk that gives way to slick, Minogue-inspired disco.\" Mesfin Fekadu from ABC News regarded the album as \"a collection of upbeat, dance-flavoured, power pop gems.\"  \n### Songs  \nFuture Nostalgia opens with its title track, a playful and fun synth-pop and electro-funk song, with house, hip hop, and disco elements. It has an electronic production, that includes electroclash synths, disco beats, funk and grunge bass-popping, and a jazz piano progression. In the song, Lipa name-drops its producer, Jeff Bhasker, and American architect, John Lautner, while vocally making use of falsetto and spoken word deliveries. Lyrically, it deals with themes of feminism and self-reflection. The following track and lead single, \"Don't Start Now\", has empowerment themes and sees Lipa addressing an ex-lover about moving on from a relationship, using direct bullet point instructions. She uses her lower-register vocals, over a production consisting of cowbells, accented disco strings, and a rhythm guitar loop. Musically, it is a nu-disco song with elements of dance-pop and Eurodance. Synth-pop cut, \"Cool\", has inspirations from 1980s music and Prince. The song is about the initial rush of falling in love, painting a picture of a summer romance, with confidence and vulnerability themes, and reckless, youthful energy. Driven by a funk bass, glitter gel noises and a drum line embody the production, whilst Lipa contributes vocals with hopeful tones.  \n\"Physical\" has a message of female strength, not needing a man to save them, with lyrics about an intense and lustful relationship. A power pop and synth-pop song, it includes dance-rock, dark wave, and Italo disco elements, while Lipa's lower register vocal performance uses deadpan, spoken word, belts, and chants. The song shares a chorus line with Olivia Newton-John's 1981 single of the same name, and includes sawtooth wave synths, a synth flute, and hi-hats in its production. \"Levitating\" is an electro-disco, pop-funk, and nu-disco track, with elements of dance-pop, electronic, 1990s pop and R&B, power pop and space rock genres. It includes a Blondie-influenced rap by Lipa, while having nu-disco rhythms, disco strings, and talk box vocals production-wise. Lyrically, Lipa exposes her feelings for a significant other, through numerous outer space references. Electro-R&B track, \"Pretty Please\", has disco-pop details and soft-spoken vocals. Driven by a bass and click, the song has a stripped-back production, emphasizing its guitars and synths, while also including cowbells and pitch-modulated vocal effects. The lyrics see Lipa attempting to be really chill at the beginning of a relationship, but realizing that is unlike her, as she pleas for stress relief from her partner who slows that down.  \n<image>\"Break My Heart\" interpolates the rhythm-guitar melody from \"Need You Tonight\" by INXS (pictured).\nDescribed by Lipa as her \"festival song,\" \"Hallucinate\" is a disco and house track, with dance, electro swing, psychedelic, and synth-pop elements. Lipa showcases her higher vocal register, and contributes a 1990s diva hook. Lyrically, the song describes how crazy love can make one feel, over a production consisting of pianissimo synths, hi-hats, and orchestrations. Lipa's favourite song on the record, \"Love Again\", is a dance-pop, disco, and electro song, with a classic sound, that includes a sample of the trumpet from Lew Stone's 1932 recording \"My Woman\". The 21st-century nu-disco production is made up of orchestrations, including 1970s disco strings, violins, and an acoustic guitar. Its lyrics have heartbreak and personal growth themes, which see a faithful Lipa offering her heart to a new partner after an upsetting breakup. Lipa describes \"Break My Heart\" as a \"celebration of vulnerability,\" seeing her question whether a new love will leave her broken-hearted, with lyrics comparing it to the COVID-19 pandemic's social distancing measures. It interpolates rhythm guitar melody from \"Need You Tonight\" (1987) by INXS, alongside Europop and dance beats, disco violins, and a techno-adjacent bassline as the production. Musically, it is a disco and dance-pop song, with a retro-futuristic sound, and elements of funk and house.  \n\"Good in Bed\", is a hip hop-pop hybrid, which was widely compared to the works of Lily Allen. Its production uses off-kilter jazz piano plinking, gum-popping sound effects, and lo-fi keys, with fairy-like backing vocal harmonies, and Lipa contributing high octave whispers. The album's sole explicit track, it uses bad, mad, and sad rhymes, with lyrics about a relationship where good sex is the only thing holding two people together. Future Nostalgia closes with \"Boys Will Be Boys\", a baroque pop and chamber pop ballad turned anthem, with gospel elements. Lipa makes use of belting and chanting, over a melodramatic melody, disco beats, layered choral arrangements, marching band drums, and orchestral strings. Lyrically, the song speaks about the growing pains girls experience and how they have to grow up so fast, taking aim at male violence, sexual harassment, toxic masculinity, double standards, and misogyny, while having empowerment and feminism themes.\n\n## Release and promotion  \nThe album was issued on 27 March 2020, by Warner Records, Lipa's second to be released under the label.

The song was accompanied by a lyric video, set in a retro 1960s house on a small lake, where Lipa dances, drinks alcohol and hits golf balls.  \n### The Moonlight Edition  \nFollowing the release of Future Nostalgia, Lipa teased the release of tracks that did not make it to the album's standard edition, stating \"I have a couple of songs that I've worked on, and that I kind of put aside for a second wind, so that's all to be discussed\". Lipa further explained that she had always planned a reissue as she was very \"cutthroat\" when choosing the standard edition songs. In April 2020, she confirmed Future Nostalgia would receive a deluxe reissue and further teased it while serving as a guest Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen the following month. In July 2020, a fan commented on one of Lipa's Instagram posts asking for the release of the Future Nostalgia B-sides; Lipa replied and confirmed their release and also stated that she has \"enough music to hold her fans all the way through till 2022\".  \nLipa described \"Fever\" as an introduction to the B-sides. In a YouTube chat with her fans for the release of its music video, Lipa announced that the B-sides would be released in 2021. In January 2021, Lipa further teased the B-sides release with a post on social media with the caption \"B-sides are on the way\". She further teased it through until the next month. On 4 February 2021 Dua officially announced the reissue day and its title, Future Nostalgia: The Moonlight Edition. The Moonlight Edition was released one week later on 11 February 2021, alongside the reissue's lead single \"We're Good\".  \n## Critical reception  \nFuture Nostalgia received widespread acclaim from critics.

Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 8.5 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. According to Metacritic, Future Nostalgia is the 15th most acclaimed album released in 2020.  \nWriting for NME, Rhian Daly wrote that \"Future Nostalgia is a bright, bold collection of pop majesty to dance away your anxieties to... if only for a little while\". Chris Taylor of The Line of Best Fit praised Lipa's direction for the album, saying \"Future Nostalgia is an artist in total control. It's built on such an addictive carefree spirit that it's hard not to let loose and go with it. The greatest pop star of this generation? That's for you to decide. But Future Nostalgia makes a very convincing argument that Dua Lipa just might be\". Chris Willman of Variety praised the album's musical direction, writing \"after calling it a great disco record, we might also call Future Nostalgia a great MTV-era album that just happens to be not of the MTV era\". Writing for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos also praised the album's musical direction, writing \"Future Nostalgia is a breathtakingly fun, cohesive and ambitious attempt to find a place for disco in 2020\".  \nWriting for DIY, Elly Watson wrote \"this album has proved: Dua will be going down in pop history as one of the best\". Laura Snapes of The Guardian complimented Lipa's choice of songs, writing \"The 11-track Future Nostalgia offers neither features nor filler, and makes a strident case for Lipa as a pop visionary, not a vessel\". Michael Cragg of Crack summarised the album as \"packed with full-throttle choruses, supple melodies and lashings of attitude, Future Nostalgia is a neon-hued sound of one of the world's biggest pop stars smashing it out of the park\". Similarly, Craig Jenkins of Vulture commended the \"sturdy\" songs, also writing that Minogue and Madonna are their \"predecessors\" sonically. Jenkins concluded that Lipa has \"only scratched the surface of what she's capable of\".  \nIn his Substack-published \"Consumer Guide\" column, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention and called it an \"Olivia Newton-John tribute as dance smash as what-me-despair placebo, that deserves props for adding two keepers to that canon\", namely the title track and \"Good in Bed\".  \n### Year-end lists  \nFuture Nostalgia placed in the top ten of the year-end lists of several publications, including being viewed as 2020's best album by Entertainment.ie, Gaffa, GQ, People, Slate and Vogue India.  \n## Awards and nominations  \n## Commercial performance  \nFuture Nostalgia debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart with 34,390 units, only 550 units behind 5 Seconds of Summer's Calm.

After charting for almost a year the album climbed back to the number one spot in March 2021. It was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for the 35,000 units sold. Following the release of the album's Australian tour edition vinyl in April 2022, the album returned to number one for a third non-consecutive week in its 108th week on the chart.  \nThe album topped the record charts of 14 countries, including Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain.  \nFuture Nostalgia debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 dated 11 April 2020, with 66,000 album-equivalent units, including 18,000 pure album sales. A major improvement over her self-titled debut album (which peaked at number 27), it became Lipa's first top 10 album on the chart. The following week, the album dropped to number 8, with sales declining by 43% to nearly 38,000 units. It remained within the top ten in its third week. As of December 2020, the album has sold 931,000 album-equivalent units in the United States. After the release of its reissue The Moonlight Edition in February 2021, the album surged back at number seven on the Billboard 200, reaching the top 10 for the first time in 10 months with 32,000 album-equivalent units earned, increasing by 58% compared to the previous week. On the chart dated 27 March 2021, following Lipa's performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, one year after its initial release, the album reached a peak of number three on the chart, moving 37,000 album-equivalent units that week.  \nAccording to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Future Nostalgia was the tenth most successful album of 2020 worldwide, with 3.3 million album-equivalent units sold.

According to Tom Corson, co-chairman of Warner Records, Lipa has \"the benefit of being a pioneer\" for being \"the first major pop star to release an album in quarantine\". David Levesley of GQ magazine described Future Nostalgia as \"the decade's first great pop album\" and explained that the album \"balances stadium anthems with also being a gospel of feminine excellence for all the teens looking to her for inspiration\". while Chris Willman of Variety called the album the \"Reigning Dance-Pop Album of the Century\", compared it to Taylor Swift's Folklore, and further wrote that both albums \"barely seemed to exist in the same world, let alone genre, but they effectively captured a populace's polarized reactions to the cessation of normal life as anyone knew it\". Rolling Stone described Future Nostalgia as \"the disco liberation soundtrack we need\" during COVID-19 pandemic.  \nThe Daily Beast called the album a \"apocalypse game-changer\" and emphasized that it will \"have us dancing until the world ends\". The Wall Street Journal called Lipa \"one of the biggest breakout stars of lockdown\" due to the critical and commercial success of the album. According to BBC News, Lipa is one of the artists who brought the 80s back to the music industry. She was also one of the UK's most-played artist in 2020 as the album \"proved to be the soundtrack to many people's quarantine, with its uplifting disco anthems providing the perfect antidote to isolation\". Upon the release of Drake's Honestly, Nevermind and Beyoncé's Renaissance, both in 2022, some publications cited Future Nostalgia as the predictor of a house music revival.  \n## Track listing  \n#\n\nQuestion: Which song from the descriptions provided features a sample of the trumpet from Lew Stone's 1932 recording \"My Woman\"?\nChoice list: \nA. \"Boys Will Be Boys\"\nB. \"Love Again\"\nC. \"Break My Heart\"\nD. \"Good in Bed\"\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.",

The best-known variety is the oreboat, depicted in songs from Gordon Lightfoot, Stan Rogers and others. Some classic-design lakers still operate, including a few with steam engines.\n\n#### SS Col. James M Schoonmaker: Toledo, OhioSS Col. James M Schoonmaker (Toledo, Ohio)  \nCol. James M. Schoonmaker sailed from 1911 to 1980. She was first owned by the Shenango Furnace Company under her present name and was sold to the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, which renamed her Willis B Boyer. Col. James M. Schoonmaker was the largest bulk freighter in the world when commissioned. In an ambitious restoration, Col James M. Schoonmaker was re-christened with its original name July 1, 2011, on the 100th anniversary of the ship's launching in Toledo, Ohio. In October 2012, she was moved with great fanfare from her longtime berth at International Park in Toledo downriver to a site next to the new home of the National Museum of the Great Lakes.

She sailed from 1900, to 1962 when she was sunk as a breakwater at Cleveland, Ohio where she was buried under 39 feet of dredgings from the Cuyahoga River.  \n* Howard L. Shaw was a abbr=on long Lake freighter that was built in 1900 by the Detroit Shipbuilding Company of Wyandotte, Michigan, for the Eddy-Shaw Transit Company of Bay City, Michigan. She was sunk on July 4, 1960 in Ontario Place where she remains to this day.  \n* The hull of the E.W. Oglebay still survives as part of the dock at Drummond Island. She is the oldest surviving hull on the Great Lakes, being built in 1896.  \n* The pilot house from the Thomas Walters survives as part of the Ashtabula Maritime & Surface Transportation Museum in Ashtabula, Ohio. It's noted that the Walters was the freighter built to replace the William C. Moreland, which ran aground on Sawtooth Reef, Lake Superior.  \n* The Pilot house of the Irvan L.

The Calcite was built in 1912 and was at the time the largest self-unloading ship in the world.  \n## Failed museum attempts, ships scrappedFailed museum attempts (ships scrapped)  \nSeveral other lakers nearly became museums but, due to funding, political opposition or other causes, were scrapped:  \n* SS Alabama: Goodrich Transit Line steamer later cut down as a barge, scrapped in 2009  \n* SS Canadiana: Crystal Beach Park boat scrapped after preservationist opposition  \n* Three-masted schooner SV 2: Built in 1846 for the lumber trade, she sank in Green Bay in 1864. She was raised in 1965 and brought to Menominee, Michigan as a museum. After years of neglect, she was dismantled in 1998.  \n* SS John Ericsson: The penultimate whaleback freighter, John Ericsson was scrapped in 1969 in Hamilton, Ontario. Politics, as was the case with Canadiana, played a central role in the loss of the ship.  \n* Wrecking tug Favorite: The Great Lakes' best-known salvage tug, likened to SS Foundation Franklin in the Canadian Maritimes. An attempt to save it at Sault Ste. Marie (next to Valley Camp failed when state funding failed to materialize and the riveted hull began to leak. She was scrapped in Detour Township, Michigan.  \n* Lewis G Harriman: A 1923 purpose-built cement carrier, the first of her kind, which sailed from her launch until 1980. Used as a storage barge until 2003, a group tried to save her; however, poor communications within the company saw the ship sold in 2004 and scrapped in Sault Ste. Marie by Purvis Marine. The majority of the hull was fed to the Algoma Steel Mill but the forecastle was saved as a summer cottage at Detour, Michigan.  \n* Lansdowne and Huron: The paddlewheel steam railroad ferry Lansdowne, built in 1884, was modified to support a restaurant in antique rail cars; Huron, built in 1875, sank at a pier in Erie, Pennsylvania. The hull was raised, but little other information about the future of the vessel is available. The hull was towed to Buffalo, New York in July 2006; however, in winter 2008 Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown called it an eyesore and demanded its removal. Lansdowne was scrapped in July 2008.  \n* SS Niagara: Built in 1897, the freighter was later converted into a sand-sucker. Scrapped in 1997 by Liberty Iron & Metal in Erie, Pennsylvania (after a failed attempt to convert her into an Erie museum), she had been saved from the scrapyard 11 years earlier.  \n* SS Seaway Queen: The Canadian straight decker Seaway Queen, formerly owned by Upper Lakes Shipping, was involved in an attempt to save her as a museum. The company failed to locate an organization capable and willing to preserve her; she was sold and scrapped in Alang, India in 2004.  \n* SS Chief Wawatam: A historic icebreaker and the last hand-fired coal steamer on the Great Lakes, Chief Wawatam was cut down to a barge and finally scrapped by its owner (Purvis Marine of Sault Ste Marie, Ontario).  \n* Three-masted schooner J.T. Wing: Last commercial sailing ship on the Great Lakes, she was used briefly in the lumber trade. She served as a training vessel before being grounded on Belle Isle in 1949 as a museum ship, and was burned before a crowd of 6,000 in 1956.  \n* E M Ford, a cement steamer, was scrapped in November 2008.  \n* J B Ford, a cement steamer, was scrapped in 2015 after a failed attempt to save her. She was the oldest floating ship on the great lakes at the time of her scrapping.  \n## Future museum potentialPotential museums  \n<image>Arthur M. Anderson unloading at Huron, Ohio in 2008. Arthur M. Anderson was following (and in contact with) Edmund Fitzgerald the night of 10 November 1975, issuing the first distress call.\n* Arthur M. Anderson, launched in 1952, is still running. She had the last contact with Edmund Fitzgerald before the latter sank, and was the first would-be rescue vessel to search for Edmund Fitzgerald.  \n* Cement steamers: The cement fleet of steamers is being supplanted by tug-barge combinations like Integrity and Innovation. Historic cement steamers include, St. Mary's Challenger (1906),J.A.W. Iglehart (1936) and Alpena (1942).  \n* Ore Carriers: The many ore boats of the American and Canadian fleets is filled with many different old and new ore carriers. Historical ore carriers include Herbert C Jackson (1959), Wilfred Sykes (1949),  Cason J Callaway (1952), Lee A. Tregurtha (1942), Saginaw (1953), SS John Sherwin (1958), Cuyahoga (1943), Edward L. Ryerson (1960), American Valor (1953), Kaye E. Barker (1952), and the John G Munson (1952)  \n* Tugs: Many tugs on the lakes are currently older than many of the freighters on the lakes some even were built before 1900. Historical Tugs  include Georgia (1897), Manitou (1943), Rocket (1901), Arkansas (1909), John M. Selvick (1898), Anchor Bay (1953), Gregory J. Busch (1919), Olive L. Moore (1928), MT Undaunted (1944), Miseford (1915), and the Radium Yellowknife (1948)  \n* Normac: 1902 fire tug converted into a passenger-packet steamer for the Owen Sound Transportation Company. Her larger running mates (Norisle and Norgoma) have been converted into museum ships. After a stint as a floating restaurant in Toronto which ended when she was accidentally rammed by a ferry, Normac was towed to Port Dalhousie, Ontario, where she serves as a floating cocktail lounge.\n\n\nQuestion: Which vessel was following and in contact with Edmund Fitzgerald the night it sank, and issued the first distress call?\nChoice list: \nA.

It took place during Memorial Day weekend on May 25, 2019, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in the Las Vegas suburb of Paradise, Nevada. The event aired through traditional PPV outlets, as well as on B/R Live in North America and FITE TV internationally.  \nThe card comprised nine matches, including two on the Buy In pre-show. In the main event, Chris Jericho defeated Kenny Omega, earning a match against Adam Page, the winner of the pre-show's Casino Battle Royale, at AEW's August event All Out to determine the inaugural AEW World Champion. Other prominent matches saw The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) defeat The Lucha Brothers (Pentagón Jr. and Rey Fénix) to retain the AAA World Tag Team Championship, and Cody defeated his brother Dustin Rhodes. The event was also notable for the surprise appearances of Awesome Kong, Bret Hart (who unveiled the AEW World Championship belt), as well as Jon Moxley (formerly known in WWE as Dean Ambrose). Moxley and Kong were confirmed to have signed with AEW.  \nThe event received critical acclaim, with Jericho vs. Omega, The Young Bucks vs. The Lucha Brothers, and Cody vs. Dustin Rhodes earning the most praise; most critics hailed the latter as the best match of the night. Double or Nothing later won the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award for Best Major Wrestling Show of 2019, while Cody vs. Dustin Rhodes won the Pro Wrestling Illustrated Award for Match of the Year.  \n## Production  \n### Background  \n<image>The inaugural Double or Nothing, which was also the inaugural All Elite Wrestling pay-per-view, was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in the Las Vegas suburb of Paradise, Nevada.\nAfter the success of the September 2018 event All In, an independent wrestling event that came as a result of a bet with wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, a group known as The Elite (Cody, The Young Bucks, and Kenny Omega), the driving forces behind the event, used the positive response from All In to pursue further events with backing of businessmen Shahid Khan and Tony Khan. In a promo after All In, Cody said \"I know when you make a bet, sometime you go double or nothing\". On November 5, 2018, several trademarks were filed in Jacksonville, Florida, among them were \"All Elite Wrestling\" and \"Double or Nothing\", leading to speculation of a formation of a promotion and the name of the promotion's first event.  \nOn January 1, 2019, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) was officially founded. Along with the announcement, the promotion's inaugural event, Double or Nothing, was scheduled to air on pay-per-view (PPV) during Memorial Day weekend on May 25, 2019, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in the Las Vegas suburb of Paradise, Nevada, with the event taking on a Vegas theme. On February 8, at AEW's Las Vegas rally, Chief Brand Officer Brandi Rhodes announced the signings of Japanese women wrestlers Aja Kong and Yuka Sakazaki, who would make their first appearances for AEW at Double or Nothing. On February 10, it was announced that pre-sale tickets sold out almost immediately after going on sale. On February 13, AEW announced that all tickets for the event sold out within 4 minutes of going on sale. In April, it was announced that Jim Ross would do play-by-play commentary for the event.  \nOn May 8, 2019, it was announced that Double or Nothing would air on ITV Box Office in the United Kingdom. Additionally, a one-hour pre-show titled \"The Buy In\" aired on ITV4 featuring the Casino Battle Royale and other matches. The following week, it was announced that it would also stream on WarnerMedia's B/R Live service in the United States and AEW's YouTube channel worldwide.\n\n### Storylines  \nThe event comprised nine professional wrestling matches, including two on the Buy In pre-show, that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines were produced on The Young Bucks' YouTube series Being The Elite and Cody's Nightmare Family YouTube series The Road to Double or Nothing, as well as at various independent wrestling shows.  \nAt AEW's inaugural rally in Jacksonville, a match featuring SoCal Uncensored (Christopher Daniels, Frankie Kazarian, and Scorpio Sky) against Oriental Wrestling Entertainment's (OWE) Cima and two partners of his choosing was announced for Double or Nothing after SoCal Uncensored challenged Cima to a match. On March 3, OWE announced a tag team tournament to determine who Cima's partners would be. On May 6, it was announced that Cima would team with T-Hawk and El Lindaman.  \n<image>Chris Jericho, who won an opportunity for the inaugural AEW World Championship by defeating Kenny Omega in the main event\nOn January 4, 2018, at New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom 12, Kenny Omega defeated Chris Jericho in their first encounter. In September at All In, after Omega defeated Penta El Zero, he was attacked by Jericho. The following month, the two were involved in a six-man tag team match at Jericho's Rock 'N' Wrestling Rager at Sea event, where Omega's team defeated Jericho's. In January 2019, Jericho signed with AEW and after Omega announced that he had signed with the promotion the following month, he was confronted by Jericho and the two brawled but were separated by Cody, Christopher Daniels, and security. A rematch from Wrestle Kingdom 12 was later announced for Double or Nothing. It was later confirmed that the winner would face the winner of the Casino Battle Royale for the inaugural AEW World Championship at a later date.  \nAt AEW's inaugural rally in Jacksonville, Britt Baker announced that she had signed with AEW. The following month during AEW's Las Vegas rally, Brandi Rhodes announced that Kylie Rae and Nyla Rose had also signed with the promotion. Following some remarks from Rae, she was interrupted by Rose and the two had a stare down but were separated before a brawl could occur. One day later, a three-way match between Baker, Rae, and Rose was announced for the event.  \nDuring AEW's Las Vegas rally, The Lucha Brothers (Pentagón Jr. and Rey Fénix) announced they had signed with AEW. Following the announcement, the duo attacked The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). On February 23, 2019 at AAW Wrestling's The Art of War, The Young Bucks attacked The Lucha Brothers. Two days later, a match between the two teams was announced for Double or Nothing. On March 16 at AAA's Rey de Reyes, The Young Bucks defeated The Lucha Brothers for the AAA World Tag Team Championship, subsequently turning their Double or Nothing match into a rematch for the championship.  \nOn February 20, 2019, on The Road to Double or Nothing, Cody announced the second Over the Budget Battle Royale for the Buy In pre-show, with initial participants being Sonny Kiss, Kip Sabian, and Brandon Cutler. On May 6, the match was renamed Casino Battle Royale. The rules were that there would be 21 entrants. Five entrants would start the match and every three minutes, five more wrestlers entered with the 21st and final entrant entering alone. It was later confirmed that the winner would receive a future AEW World Championship match against the winner of the match between Kenny Omega and Chris Jericho. On May 8, it was announced that Kip Sabian would face Sammy Guevara on the Buy In pre-show.  \nOn April 20, 2019, after weeks of teasing opponents, it was announced that Cody would face his brother Dustin Rhodes at Double or Nothing. Dustin was most famously known for his gimmick of Goldust in WWE, which granted his release in early 2019. In the following weeks, Cody declared that he would defeat his brother as a way to \"kill\" the Attitude Era.\n\n#### Canceled match  \nAt AEW's inaugural rally in Jacksonville, Adam Page was interrupted by Pac, setting up a feud between the two wrestlers. At AEW's second rally in Las Vegas, a match between Page and Pac was officially announced for Double or Nothing. However, in late May it was reported that the match was \"canceled\" and would no longer take place due to \"creative differences\". As a result of the cancellation, they wrestled a match at Wrestle Gate Pro about a week before Double or Nothing. In a surprise appearance, Page answered an open challenge by Pac that ended in disqualification with Page winning. After the match, Pac attacked Page's knee and said that his goal all along was to injure Page and with that done, he had no reason to show up at Double or Nothing. This was done to write the match off the card. Later that week on an episode of Being The Elite, Page was selling the knee injury and said he could not wrestle at Double or Nothing.  \n## Event  \n### The Buy-In  \nTwo matches occurred during the Buy In. The first was the Casino Battle Royale, in which the winner would face the winner of the main event to determine the inaugural AEW World Champion at All Out. Adam Page, the 21st and final entrant, won by last eliminating MJF.  \nIn the second match, Kip Sabian faced Sammy Guevera. Sabian performed The Deathly Hallows on Guevera to win the match.  \n### Preliminary matches  \nThe actual pay-per-view opened with SoCal Uncensored (Christopher Daniels, Frankie Kazarian, and Scorpio Sky) facing Strong Hearts (Cima, T-Hawk, and El Lindaman). Daniels and Kazarian performed the Best Meltzer Ever on Lindaman to win the match.  \nNext, a Triple Threat match between Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D, Nyla Rose and Kylie Rae was scheduled. Before the match, Brandi Rhodes announced Awesome Kong as a participant, thus the match was changed to a fatal four-way. Baker performed a Brainbuster onto her Knee on Rae to win the match.  \nAfter that, Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta) faced Angélico and Jack Evans. Taylor and Beretta performed Strong Zero on Evans to win the match.  \nLater, Hikaru Shida, Riho, and Ryo Mizunami faced Aja Kong, Emi Sakura, and Yuka Sakazaki. Shida performed a Running Knee Strike on Sakura to win the match.  \nIn the fifth match, Cody (accompanied by his wife, Brandi Rhodes) faced his brother, Dustin Rhodes. Brandi tackled Dustin on the floor, leading to referee Earl Hebner ejecting her, which Diamond Dallas Page removed her following Hebner's request. Dustin performed a Final Cut on Cody for a near-fall. Cody performed a Disaster Kick and Cross Rhodes on Dustin for a near-fall. Cody performed a second Cross Rhodes on Dustin to win. After the match, Cody announced he would team with Dustin against The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) at Fight for the Fallen. Cody and Dustin embraced in the ring after the announcement.  \nIn the penultimate match, The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) defended the AAA World Tag Team Championship against Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr and Rey Fenix). Matt and Nick performed the Meltzer Driver on Fenix to retain the title.  \n### Main event  \nIn the main event, Chris Jericho faced Kenny Omega; the winner would face Adam Page to determine the inaugural AEW World Champion at All Out. Omega performed a Baseball Slide and Rise of the Terminator on Jericho into a table. Omega performed a Springboard Double Foot Stomp on the table on Jericho. Jericho performed a Back Body Drop on Omega through the table on the floor. Omega dove off the top rope but Jericho countered into a Codebreaker for a nearfall. Omega attempted a One-Winged Angel but Jericho countered into a DDT and performed a second Codebreaker on Omega. In the end, Jericho then performed the Judas Effect on Omega to win the match. After the match, Jon Moxley (formerly Dean Ambrose in WWE) appeared and attacked both Jericho and Omega. Omega fought back and the two brawled up the entrance ramp where Moxley performed a standing fireman's carry takeover on Omega through the stage.  \n## Reception  \n### Tickets and buys  \nAccording to Dave Meltzer, there were 11,000 tickets for Double or Nothing. Of these tickets, \"almost all\" were sold in a pre-sale on February 11, 2019, in around or less than 30 minutes, to people who had earlier provided their email addresses. Travel packages and VIP packages also sold out. Ticket sales were opened to the general public on February 13, 2019, and sold out in 4 minutes.  \nOn the June 3, 2019 edition of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Dave Meltzer wrote that Double or Nothing received \"roughly 98,000 buys between television and digital PPV, with close to a 50/50 split between the two... About two-thirds came from the U.S., with the U.K., which aired the pre-show on ITV4, being the strong second followed by Australia, Germany and Canada.\" Meltzer predicted that further replay buys of Double or Nothing \"should easily\" result in it overtaking \"ECW's biggest-ever show (99,000) and becoming the biggest PPV in pro wrestling history that wasn't produced by WWE or WCW.\" Meltzer additionally described that no one has achieved this level of buys \"without regular television exposure since the 2002 Tito Ortiz vs. Ken Shamrock and UFC 47|2004 Chuck Liddell vs. Ortiz mixed martial arts fights\". On the June 10 edition, Meltzer wrote that Double or Nothing \"is estimated at somewhere between 98,500 and 113,000 buys worldwide. The best estimate has U.S. PPV buys at around 71,000, with almost an exact 50/50 split between television and B/R Live. That’s notable because nobody does a 50/50 split. The biggest split I’ve heard of for a television PPV and streaming was Conor McGregor vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov, which was an 80/20 split in favor of television. Usually it’s closer to 85/15\".  \n### Critical reception  \nJohn Powell of Canadian Online Explorer's Slam! Wrestling noted that Double or Nothing \"proved without a doubt that AEW is THE competition to WWE, THE alternative to WWE, THE very change the wrestling industry and wrestling fans have been waiting for\", with Kenny Omega, Cody Rhodes, Adam Page, Nick and Matt Jackson being the \"faces of the wrestling revolution some fans have been waiting for since March 26, 2001, when Monday Nitro went off the air and WWE bought WCW.\"  \nA CBS Sports article jointly written by Brian Campbell, Jack Crosby and Adam Silverstein declared that Double or Nothing \"felt very much like a historic card that boldly announced new competition for the long-time industry leader WWE\", as they successfully built \"anticipation of the launch of their weekly fall show on TNT\". They highlighted \"AEW's first viral moment\" created by the unannounced appearance of Jon Moxley, the \"blood and tears exchanged by the Rhodes brothers\", and the \"theatrics and aerial exploits of Kenny Omega, The Young Bucks and The Lucha Bros\".  \nTim Fiorvanti of ESPN declared: \"Double or Nothing was not a perfect first effort for AEW, but the show hit hard where it counted most -- storytelling, emotion and surprise.\" The emotion and storytelling was brought by the \"vicious, bloody war waged between brothers Cody and Dustin Rhodes\". Chris Jericho's win and the appearances of Jon Moxley and Awesome Kong were the surprises. Also, Fiorvanti felt \"the entire card reminded people how good tag-team wrestling can be when it's at its best\" and \"offered a tremendous cross section of what the future of women's wrestling will look like.\"  \nSean Radican of Pro Wrestling Torch described the event as \"fantastic first outing overall for AEW\". Omega-Jericho had a \"very sudden, but good finish\", Cody-Dustin \"was a classic throwback bloodbath that had a ton of heat\", while Young Bucks-Lucha Bros \"was a state-of-the-art tag team classic\". However, Radican noted that there \"were some warts with production and commentary\", and also preferred removing \"the pre-show and most of the undercard matches\" as the event would have been a \"total home run\" for him if it were shortened to two hours.  \nJason Powell of Pro Wrestling Dot Net wrote that AEW \"delivered big in its first pay-per-view effort\". The \"big three matches\" that ended the event \"made the show\" because they \"had real storyline support and were very well worked\". Cody-Dustin had the \"intensity, drama, and the storyline of two brothers doing battle\", Young Bucks-Lucha Bros was a \"spot crazy match that also had good emotion\", while Jericho and Omega \"definitely left it all in the ring\" despite a match that \"was sloppy here and there\".  \nMike Tedesco of WrestleView described Double or Nothing as an \"amazing show\" that \"started slow\" but ultimately reminded him \"why pro wrestling can be fun and exciting when done right\". The AAA World Tag title match was \"off the hook fun\" and \"got a little spotty, but the athleticism was on another level.\" The main event had \"great drama and action\" and \"everything made sense.\" Jon Moxley's \"amazing introduction\" \"sets him right at the top of the ladder\". However, Tedesco \"cringed with some of the comments made toward WWE\".  \nDave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter wrote that Double or Nothing \"will go down as one of the landmark PPVs in history, both because of the match quality but more the atmosphere created by the fans.\" Also, from \"a creative standpoint and connecting with fans, AEW blew away WWE\". The show indicated \"the value of social media\" and \"the dissatisfaction with WWE\". Meltzer said the Cody-Dustin match \"stole the show\", giving it five full stars. In a poll done by the newsletter of over 1700 respondents, 97.5% gave a \"thumbs up\" to the show, 1.8% were neutral, while 0.7% gave a \"thumbs down\". The publication later awarded it the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award for Best Major Wrestling Show of 2019.  \nIn November, Troy L. Smith of cleveland.com released a list of the \"50 greatest wrestling pay-per-views of all time\" from every professional wrestling promotion in the world, with Double or Nothing ranked at number 46, writing that the first AEW pay-per-view event \"feels like something that will eventually mark a turning point in the wrestling industry.\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated awarded the Cody vs. Dustin Rhodes match the Pro Wrestling Illustrated Award for Match of the Year.  \n## Aftermath  \nA week after Double or Nothing, the inaugural AEW World Championship match between Chris Jericho and Adam Page was confirmed for AEW's event, All Out, on August 31, 2019. At All Out, Jericho defeated Page to become the first-ever AEW World Champion.  \nFollowing the confrontation between Jon Moxley and Kenny Omega, a match between the two was scheduled for All Out, but it was cancelled due to Moxley suffering an elbow injury. It was then rescheduled for Full Gear in November. At Full Gear, Moxley emerged victorious.  \nAfter settling creative differences, Pac returned to AEW and replaced Jon Moxley in a match against Kenny Omega at All Out that Pac won. During Adam Page's post-event interview following his loss to Chris Jericho for the AEW World Championship at All Out, Pac interrupted the interview and said he returned to AEW to seek revenge against Page. The two were then scheduled to face each other during the debut broadcast of AEW's television show, AEW Dynamite on October 2.  \nDouble or Nothing has since been called AEW's marquee event, and along with their next three major PPVs, All Out, Full Gear, and Revolution, the four together are considered AEW's \"Big Four\" PPVs, their four biggest shows produced quarterly.  \n## Results  \n### Casino Battle Royale entrances and eliminations  \nFive wrestlers started the match. Every three minutes, five more wrestlers entered. The 21st and final entrant entered alone.\n\nQuestion: Which event did the person in the second image win an opportunity for the inaugural championship by defeating his opponent in the main event?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Kuvshinovsky District  \nKuvshinovsky District  (Кувши́новский райо́н) is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the thirty-six in Tver Oblast, Russia. It is located in the center of the oblast and borders with Vyshnevolotsky District in the north, Torzhoksky District in the east, Staritsky District in the south, Selizharovsky District in the southwest, Ostashkovsky District in the west, and with Firovsky District in the northwest. The area of the district is. Its administrative center is the town of Kuvshinovo. Population: 15,386 (2010 Census); p1989=20,601 The population of Kuvshinovo accounts for 65.0% of the district's total population.  \n## Geography  \nKuvshinovsky District list in the southern part of the Valdai Hills, and the divide between the drainage basins of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caspian Sea runs through the district. The northern part of the district belongs to the drainage basin of the Tsna River, a tributary of Lake Mstino in the drainage basin of the Neva and the Baltic Sea. The Tsna itself has its source the district. The rivers in the center and in the south of the district belong to the basin of the Volga. The major part of the district belongs to the basin of the Osuga River, which crosses the district from est to east. The rivers in the southern part of the district drain into the Bolshaya Kosha, which has its source in the district. The Osuga is a right tributary of the Tvertsa, a left tributary of the Volga, whereas the Bolshaya Kosha is a left tributary of the Volga. 76% of the area of the district is occupied by forest.  \n## History  \n<image>An abandoned house in the village of Pechnikovo.\nIn the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanlandia Governorate (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate), and in 1727 Novgorod Governorate split off. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and the area was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to Tver Governorate. The area was divided between Novotorzhsky (with the center in Torzhok) and Vyshnevolotsky (Vyshny Volochyok) uyezds.  \nOn 1 October 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Kamensky District with the administrative center in the settlement of Kuvshinovo was established. It belonged to Rzhev Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Kamensky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. In 1938, Kuvshinovo was merged with the nearby selo of Kamenka and granted town status. In February 1963, during the abortive administrative reform by Nikita Khrushchev, Novotorzhsky, Likhoslavlsky, and Kamensky Districts were merged into a new district which was called Torzhoksky District. On January 12, 1965 Kuvshinovsky District (which occupied the same area as the former Kamensky District) was re-established. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast.\n\n## Economy  \n### Industry  \nAs of 2010, the paper production was responsible for 92.4% of the total industrial output of the district. Production of electrical equipment, textile, and food was also present. The Kuvshinovo Paper Mill (built in the 19th century by merchant Kuvshinov, hence the name) was producing paper until the 1990s, and then the local timber production stopped, and the mill had to switch to cardboard production.  \n### Agriculture  \n<image>A tower in the village of Lukino\nThe main agricultural specializations of the district are cattle breeding with meat and milk production, as well as crops and potato growing.\n\n### Transportation  \nA railway line which connects Likhoslavl with Soblago via Torzhok and Selizharovo crosses the area of the district from east to west and passes Kuvshinovo. It is served by infrequent passenger traffic.  \nA road connecting Torshok with Ostashkov crosses the district from east to west and runs through Kuvshinovo. Another road connects Kuvshinovo with Vyshny Volochyok via Yesenovichi. There are local roads as well, with the bus traffic originating from Kuvshinovo.  \n## Culture and recreation  \nMogilyovskaya Pustyn  \nThe district contains forty cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally twenty-nine objects (three of them in Kuvshinovo) classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federally protected monuments include the ensembles of Borok, Gornitsy, Pryamukhino, and Velemozhye Estates, of the Mogilyovskaya Pustyn monastery, as well as several churches of the 18th and the 19th centuries.  \nKuvshinovo has a local museum. Pryamukhino Estate belonged to the Bakunin family. In the estate, Mikhail Bakunin was born. Currently, a museum is open in Pryamukhino.\n\nQuestion: Which description corresponds to the image of the abandoned house?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Variolation  \nVariolation was the method of inoculation first used to immunize individuals against smallpox (Variola) with material taken from a patient or a recently variolated individual, in the hope that a mild, but protective, infection would result. Only 1–2% of those variolated died from the intentional infection compared to 30% who contracted smallpox naturally. Variolation is no longer used today. It was replaced by the smallpox vaccine, a safer alternative. This in turn led to the development of the many vaccines now available against other diseases.  \nThe procedure was most commonly carried out by inserting/rubbing powdered smallpox scabs or fluid from pustules into superficial scratches made in the skin. The virus was normally spread through the air, infecting first the mouth, nose, or respiratory tract, before spreading throughout the body via the lymphatic system. In contrast, infection of the skin usually led to a milder, localized infection, but, crucially, still induced immunity to the virus. The patient would develop pustules like those caused by naturally acquired smallpox. Eventually, after about two to four weeks, these symptoms would subside, indicating successful recovery and immunity.  \nThe method was first used in China, India, parts of Africa and the Middle East before it was introduced into England and North America in the 1720s in the face of some opposition. However, inoculation had been reported in Wales since the early 17th century.  \n## Terminology  \nThe terminology used to describe the prevention of smallpox can cause confusion. In 18th-century medical terminology, inoculation refers to smallpox inoculation. Confusion is caused by writers who interchange variolation and vaccination through either mistranslation or misinterpretation. The term variolation refers solely to inoculation with smallpox virus and is related to but not interchangeable with vaccination. The latter term was first used in 1800 soon after Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine derived from cowpox, an animal disease distinct from smallpox. The term variolation was then used from the 19th century to avoid confusion with vaccination. Most modern writers tend to refer to smallpox inoculation as variolation throughout without regard for chronology, as is used here. Further confusion was caused when, in 1891, Louis Pasteur honoured Jenner by widening the terms vaccine/vaccination to refer to the artificial induction of immunity against any infectious disease. Inoculation refers to intentionally exposing an individual to a virus, bacterium, other pathogen, or artificial vaccine that may induce active immunity, and inoculation can be done by any suitable route of administration. Many familiar vaccines are injected intramuscularly or swallowed.date=December 2022  \nThe term \"inoculation\" entered medical English through horticultural usage meaning to graft a bud (or eye) from one plant into another. It is derived from the  Latin in + oculus (eye).  \n## Origins  \n### China  \nThe Chinese practiced the oldest documented use of variolation, dating back to the fifteenth century. They implemented a method of \"nasal insufflation\" administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the 16th and 17th centuries within China, most notably by Wan Quan. According to such documentation, mild smallpox cases were selected as donors in order to prevent serious attack. The technique used scabs that had been left to dry out for some time. Fresh scabs were more likely to lead to a full-blown infection. Three or four scabs were ground into powder or mixed with a grain of musk and bound in cotton. Infected material was then packed into a pipe and puffed up the patient's nostril. The practice of variolation is believed to have been ritualized by the Chinese. The blowpipe used during the procedure was made of silver. The right nostril was used for boys and the left for girls. Variolated cases were treated as if they were as infectious as those who had acquired the disease naturally. These patients were subsequently kept apart from others until the rash had cleared. In the 18th century, the practice of using scabs from epidemic patients was seen as beneficial by some, but others were convinced of its danger; Emperor Kangxi, however, approved of it. Two reports on the Chinese practice were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China, and another by the physician Clopton Havers, but no action was taken.  \n### India  \nIndia has been suggested as another possible origin for the spread of variolation into Europe, particularly the Ottoman Empire and Wales. There are two accounts from the 18th century of inoculations being performed by itinerant Brahmins: Oliver Coult in 1731 wrote that it had been \"first performed by Dununtary a physician of Champanagar\" about 150 years before that time (Dhanvantari being the name of the Hindu God of medicine, and a common name among physicians), and John Zephaniah Holwell in 1768 wrote of its being practiced for many hundreds of years. Aspects of these accounts have been called into question, but reportedly, by 1768 inoculation was being practiced in Bengal. The doctors who performed this procedure were known as Tikadars. The term tika is still in use now to mean 'vaccination' in many Indian languages.  \n### Sudan  \nSimilar methods were seen through the Middle East and Africa. Two similar methods were described in Sudan during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Both had been long established and stemmed from Arabic practices. Tishteree el Jidderi ('buying the smallpox') was a practice seen within the women of Sennar in central Sudan. A mother of an unprotected child would visit the house of a newly infected child and tie a cotton cloth around the ailing child's arm. She would then haggle with the child's mother over the cost of each pustule. When a bargain was struck, the woman would return home and tie the cloth around her own child's arm. Variations of this practice included bringing gifts to the donor. The second method was known as Dak el Jedri ('hitting the smallpox'), a method similar to that used in the Ottoman Empire and eventually transported into England. Fluid was collected from a smallpox pustule and rubbed into a cut made into the patient's skin. This practice spread more widely through Africa. It may have also traveled with merchants and pilgrims along the middle-eastern caravan routes into Turkey and Greece.  \n## Western Europe  \nLetters from physicians in Wales published in 1722 indicated the local use of variolation from as early as 1600 near the Welsh port of Haverfordwest. Another reference to variolation is by Thomas Bartholin in 1675.  \nAfter coming across the practice in Constantinople, the physician Emmanuel Timoni wrote a letter describing the method in detail which was later published in the Philosophical Transactions in 1714 and read to the Royal Society. The report caught the attention of a Bostonian minister, Cotton Mather who mentions an encounter in 1707 with a Garamante from Libya named Onesimus. Mather said that Onesimus's society already had a practice of an operation that would have \"given him something of the smallpox and would forever preserve him from it\".  Benjamin Colman, also a minister, mentions inoculation practices from Africa. In the same period, Lady Mary Montagu, the wife of a British diplomat to the Ottoman Empire, said variolation was widely practiced in the Ottoman Empire.  \n### Lady Montagu  \nLady Mary Wortley Montagu had lost her brother to smallpox in 1713. In 1715 she contracted the disease herself. Although she survived, she was left with severe facial scarring. While in the Ottoman Empire she came across the process of variolation as it was introduced and published in Constantinople by two Greek doctors, Emmanuel Timoni and Iacob Pylarino. She first mentioned variolation in the famous letter to her friend, Sarah Chiswell, in April 1717. in which she enthusiastically recounted the process, which in Constantinople was most commonly administered by experienced elderly women. In 1718, she had the procedure conducted on her five-year-old son, Edward Montagu. The procedure was supervised by the embassy doctor Charles Maitland. On her return to England, she had her four-year-old daughter variolated in the presence of physicians of the Royal Court in 1721. Both variolations proved successful. Later on that year Maitland conducted an experimental variolation of six prisoners in Newgate Prison in London. In the experiment, six condemned prisoners were variolated and later exposed to smallpox with the promise of freedom if they survived. The experiment was a success, and soon variolation was drawing attention from the royal family, who helped promote the procedure throughout England. However, variolation caused the death of Prince Octavius of Great Britain, eighth son and thirteenth child of King George III in 1783.  \n<image>Engraving of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu by Samuel Freeman, after a portrait by Sir Godfrey Kneller\nDespite opposition, variolation established itself as a mainstream medical treatment in England. Part of its success was founded on statistical observation, which confirmed that variolation was a safer alternative to contracting smallpox naturally, strengthened by the assumption that it protected against the disease for life. The major faults of variolation lay in its simplicity. Doctors sought to monopolize the simple treatment by convincing the public that the procedure could only be done by a trained professional. The procedure was now preceded by a severe bloodletting, in which the patient was bled, often to faintness, in order to 'purify' the blood and prevent fever. Doctors also began to favour deep incisions, which also discouraged amateurs.\n\n### The Suttonian Method  \nThe main proponents of the English variolation movement were the Suttons, a family of physicians who would revolutionize the practice. The patriarch, Robert Sutton, was a surgeon from Suffolk. In 1757 the procedure failed on one of his sons. He sought a new method in which the procedure would become as mild as possible. By 1762 he began advertising \"A New Method of Inoculating for Small-Pox.\" Sutton kept his method a secret and shared it only with his three sons. The mystique and effectiveness behind this new method helped to promote their business, which soon became very successful. They established a network of variolation houses and clinics and offered franchises to other variolators for a share of the profits, on condition that the secret would not be revealed. By 1770, the Suttons had treated over 300,000 satisfied customers. Daniel, the eldest of the Sutton sons, eventually revealed the family secret in his book The Inoculator, published in 1796. The success of their method lay in a shallow scratch, careful selection of only mildly affected donors, and no bleeding or extreme purging. Although the renown of the Suttons gradually faded after this revelation, the family's lasting impression would remain for generations.  \nThomas Nettleton (1683–1748) was a precursor of the Suttons around 1722.  \nOther prominent English variolators included Thomas Dimsdale, who published accounts of his method in 1769 and 1781; William Woodville, appointed Director of the London Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital in 1791, who published a history of variolation in 1796; and John Haygarth, who published an ambitious plan to exterminate smallpox in 1783.  \n### Johnnie Notions  \nJohn Williamson, more commonly known by the nickname Johnnie Notions, was a self-taught physician from Shetland, Scotland, who independently developed and successfully administered a variolation for smallpox to thousands of patients in Shetland during the late 18th century. Despite having only an elementary education and no formal medical background, the effectiveness of the treatment he devised yielded an extremely high success rate, resulting in the immunisation of approximately 3,000 people and the saving of many lives, which had a significant effect on the demographics of the Shetland population at the time. He is reputed to have not lost a single patient.  \nNotions would first collect smallpox pus. He would then dry it using peat smoke (which was believed to lessen the virus's virulence), and bury it in the ground with camphor (which has anti-bacterial properties, preventing the matter from decomposing). Oral history indicates the matter was spread between sheets of glass before burial. It would be kept in this state for up to seven or eight years to reduce its virulence before being administered to a patient. By using a knife (which Notions made himself) he would incise into the patient's arm intradermally (without drawing blood), insert a small amount of the matter, and immediately cover the incision with the patient's skin, before using a cabbage leaf as a plaster. In contrast to contemporaneous quack doctors, Notions would not stipulate any particular resting conditions (such as \"hot-treatment\" – heating the ill patient in front of a fire, covering them with blankets and allowing them no fresh-air), nor would he administer any other medicines during the period of infection and recovery.  \nNotions' variolation bears a strong similarity to the Suttonian method. How Notions became aware of this method of variolation is unclear – it may have been through written account, or through discussion with someone else aware of the technique, such as another physician or a member of the clergy.  \n### Widespread recognition  \n<image>\"Queens\" of Mysore: left, Krishnaraja Wadiyar III's first wife, Devajammani has a discoloration around the mouth, thought to be due to the blowing of variolation dust in the nose (\"nasal insufflation\"). Right, his second wife shows the discrete mark left by vaccination under her saree. Thomas Hickey, 1805.\nIn 1738, variolation was added to the second edition of Chambers' Cyclopædia, which in its time was an authority of knowledge for the literary class. Later in 1754, variolation received the sanction of the Royal College of Physicians. All of this made England the international center of variolation, attracting visitors from all over the world to explore this \"new\" method of prevention. The nation also acted as a magnet for those who sought to introduce the benefits of variolation to their own countries. A remarkable example of this is the introduction of variolation into Russia. Thomas Dimsdale, a prominent banker, politician, and physician, was invited to visit St Petersburg to variolate Catherine the Great. In 1769, he variolated Catherine, her 14-year-old son Grand Duke Paul, and over 140 prominent members of the Court. The results were successful. Dimsdale was created a baron of the Russian Empire, and awarded £10,000, with £2000 for expenses and an annuity of £500. His son, who accompanied him, was also rewarded. In case Dimsdale's variolations had ended badly, Catherine had arranged a relay of horses to carry them safely out of the country.  \nFrance was the last European country to embrace variolation. It was not until an outbreak of smallpox in Paris in 1752 nearly killed the heir to the French throne that the public embraced the practice after seeing the prince variolated. Similarly in Japan, Chinese merchant Li Jen-Shan proposed the method of traditional Chinese intranasal variolation after a severe smallpox outbreak in Nagasaki in 1744. This led Japanese physician 3=緒方春朔 to variolate children using a human smallpox vaccination method during an outbreak in Chikuzen Province from 1789 to 1790. There were no deaths among the children, and they all appeared to be protected.  \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, variolation had gained widespread global respect and was thought to be one of the greatest medical successes of its time. It had become the subject of serious medical study, leading physicians like John Haygarth from Chester, England, to explore its application on a larger scale. In 1793 he published A Sketch of a Plan to Exterminate the Small-Pox from Great Britain. This relied on rules summarised by Donald Hopkins; Its implementation at the time was impractical for logistical reasons and the risk that variolation would spread smallpox. However, with suitable modifications, such as the substitution of vaccination for variolation, it was remarkably similar to the strategy adopted during the World Health Organization's smallpox eradication campaign.\n\n## Spread into America  \nDocumentation of variolation in the Americas may be traced back to 1706 in Boston, where Puritan minister Cotton Mather learned of the technique from his West African slave Onesimus. Further research into the matter revealed to Mather that several other slaves had too been variolated. In 1714, he came across Timoni's article in Philosophical Transactions, in which he described methods of variolation found in Turkey. Mather was able to implement this new method in 1721 when Boston suffered a smallpox outbreak, although others such as William Douglass strongly opposed the idea.  \nThe main arguments against variolation were on religious grounds. Because religion was never far from any aspect of life in eighteenth-century Boston, several wondered how this new method would coincide with religious teachings. The simplest debate argued that variolation was ungodly because it was not mentioned specifically in the Bible. Inoculation was also viewed by some as a direct affront to God's innate right to determine who was to die, and how and when death would occur. Several believed smallpox outbreaks were well-merited punishments for the sins of those who contracted the disease. Those who were empirically minded saw the notion of using the products of such a deadly disease to prevent said disease as being an insult to logic.  \nDespite these persistent arguments, Mather also gained several supporters. Among this group of followers was surgeon Zabdiel Boylston, who urged Mather to further promote the procedure. With the support of Mather, Boylston went on to successfully variolate 300 patients, with only six of them dying. By contrast, 1,000 of the 6,000 people who acquired smallpox naturally died during the same period. Boylston traveled to London in 1724. There he published his results and was elected to the Royal Society in 1726.  \nFrom Boston, the practice spread throughout the colonies. In 1775, George Washington ordered that the Continental Army be variolated. By the end of the American Revolutionary War, variolation had gained widespread acceptance in the larger cities and towns of the United States.  \n## Transition into vaccination  \nThe success of variolation led many, including medical professionals, to overlook its drawbacks. Variolation was practiced on the basis that it protected against smallpox for life, and was far less likely to kill than natural infection. In some cases however, natural smallpox or variolation failed to protect from a second attack. These cases were a result of a lapse of immune \"memory\", while others may have been misdiagnosed (experts often confused smallpox with chickenpox). Variolation also required a level of skill and attention to detail which some physicians lacked. Many physicians failed to take note of local redness and discharge to assure the variolation had taken, resulting in inadequate treatment. However, it was its great risk to others that led to the end of the practice. The collateral smallpox cases spread by variolated subjects shortly after variolation began to outweigh the benefits of the procedure.  \nFrom the 1760s, a number of individuals, including John Fewster, Peter Plett, Benjamin Jesty, and particularly Edward Jenner, were interested in the use of material from cowpox, an animal infection, to protect against smallpox. In 1796, Jenner vaccinated James Phipps, did more vaccinations in 1798, and was the first to publish evidence that cowpox protected against smallpox, was safer than variolation, and that his vaccine could be maintained by arm-to-arm transfer. The use of variolation soon began to decline as the smallpox vaccine became widely used and its benefits appreciated. Various countries made variolation illegal, starting with Russia in 1805.  \nVariolation served as a natural precursor to the discovery of vaccination. The major differences between the two were that in vaccination, material from cowpox, an animal disease, was used, but particularly that it was far safer to those vaccinated and was far more rarely transmitted to their contacts. Vaccination offered the public a less-harmful method of preventing smallpox. Vaccination would revolutionize the control of smallpox, leading to its eventual eradication. The extension of the principle of vaccination by Pasteur and his successors would lead to the development of vaccines for diseases such as diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza, and make the eradication of infectious diseases, particularly poliomyelitis, a realistic prospect.  \n## Decline  \nAlthough variolation eventually declined or was banned in some countries, it was still practiced in others. \"Buying the smallpox\" was still practiced in Sudan until the late nineteenth century. However, variolation survived longer elsewhere. During the World Health Organization's Smallpox Eradication Campaign, vaccination teams came across variolators in remote areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan and their samples were confiscated. In the early stages of the campaign, live virus was detected in some, but as the campaign progressed variolators could not replenish their stocks, and although virus particles were detected in some samples, very few contained live virus.683–85 Our knowledge about the survival of smallpox virus suggests that passage of time makes it extremely unlikely that any infectious samples have survived.1173–77  \n## Other diseases  \nAlthough variolation has ceased, it has influenced the concept of other traditional practices, such as \"pox parties\", in which children are intentionally exposed to diseases like chickenpox, measles and rubella, in an attempt to gain immunity. Although strongly discouraged by public health officials, the practice persists.  \nWhile intentional exposure has been rejected as a strategy to combat COVID-19 because of the risks involved, there is also a hypothesis that widespread to universal use of face coverings is associated with a higher proportion of asymptomatic or relatively mild infections because of the decreased dose of viral particles expelled or received by the wearer, as a welcome addition to their primary purpose of significantly reducing transmission by asymptomatic wearers.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true based on the information provided in the descriptions of the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

The game follows the character of Ophelia from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. In Elsinore, Ophelia has a vision of the deaths of everyone in Elsinore Castle and relives the same four days again and again as she works to prevent the tragedy that will fall over everyone.  \nDevelopment on Elsinore took over seven years, and was carried out on nights and weekends by its development team. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who noted that fans of Hamlet would appreciate it but that the game's slow pace could be sometimes frustrating.  \n## Gameplay  \n<image>Laertes and Hamlet duel as Ophelia watches. The journal and other ways the player can see what is happening in Elsinore Castle are found in the top left, while a map shows Ophelia's current location in the top right.\nElsinore is a point-and-click adventure game based on William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. The player controls the character of Ophelia as she experiences a time loop leading up to the tragedy at the end of the play. During the four days leading up to those events, the player moves Ophelia throughout Elsinore Castle and talks with its residents in order to manipulate the outcome of events. The conversations the player has leads to unforeseen outcomes in which tragedy still occurs in other ways—every time Ophelia dies, the time loop begins again, four days before the end of Hamlet.  \nTo manipulate events, the player talks to the castle's residents about events that they have witnessed or expect to occur. The game provides a \"Hearsay\" menu, which shows which topics can be broached. As Ophelia goes through multiple loops and witnesses scenes, she remembers these when she wakes up again and can bring them up to other characters. The game includes a branching timeline that shows the player possibilities they can be aware of, showing both the location of an event to happen and the time of it. Outside of Ophelia's deaths, the game has 13 unique endings that change based on the player's choices throughout the game.\n\n## Plot  \nThe plot of Hamlet revolves around the Danish court of the recently deceased King Hamlet. Denmark fears that an invasion from Prince Fortinbras of Norway could be imminent. Prince Hamlet, son of the recently deceased king and nephew to King Claudius, meets his father's ghost. The ghost reveals that he was murdered by Claudius and makes Hamlet vow to avenge his death. Believing him to be Claudius, Hamlet accidentally kills Polonius, enraging Polonius' son, Laertes. After an attempt to kill Hamlet fails, Claudius and Laertes plot to murder him in a duel by using a poisoned sword and poison in the prince's drink. Ophelia, Laertes' sister, drowns Hamlet returns for Ophelia's funeral and gets into a fight with Laertes. Hamlet and Laertes duel, and through various means both of them die along with Claudius and Queen Gertrude. Fortinbras arrives as Hamlet's heir and takes the crown of Denmark.  \nElsinore begins with a vision of the deaths of everyone in Elsinore Castle, similar to the play's ending. Ophelia then manipulates events to achieve a different outcome. If the player does nothing, the events unfold as in the play and everyone dies. After Ophelia's first death, a time loop begins where she wakes up at the moment of Hamlet where Prince Hamlet is behaving erratically in her room. Ophelia's actions directly affect the plot in sometimes unpredictable ways. If Ophelia continually talks to people in Elsinore Castle about the supernatural dreams she has been having, the characters will send Ophelia off to an institution because they are convinced she has gone insane. In order to convince Hamlet to ally with Ophelia and to have him trust her with his plot, the player must search Queen Gertrude's chambers for evidence that she was not complicit with the murder of her late husband. By confronting King Claudius with evidence that he has murdered Queen Gertrude, Claudius arranges a private meeting with Ophelia and murders her.  \nThe game enlarges Ophelia and Laertes' roles, and adds additional characters such as Othello, and Peter Quince from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Quince replaces the acting troupe from Hamlet, and is one of the few characters that is aware of Ophelia's time loop. Several characters have also been adapted for the game, making Rosencrantz and Guildenstern female and Ophelia and Laertes are biracial with experience of racial discrimination. A lady-in-waiting named Brit and a cook round out a more gender balanced cast.  \n## Development  \n<image>In Hamlet, Ophelia has no agency and drowns herself at the end of act 4, making her an apt choice as the player character in Elsinore.\nTeam lead and writer Katie Chironis and game designer Connor Fallon originally met in Carnegie Mellon University's Game Creation Society. Development of Elsinore began in 2010. Chironis and Fallon originally created Elsinore as part of a game jam, scrapped the project entirely, and then decided to create it from the ground up again. Chironis was inspired to make a Hamlet game by both her high school Shakespeare teacher and from the college writing classes she took at Carnegie Mellon. Chironis and Fallon wanted to create a game that would have a tragic story but in an interactive medium, eschewing the \"power fantasy\" games that are commonly created. By combining the tragedy of the play with the goal of \"winning\" games, the development team thought they could have a fresh take on Hamlet.  \nChironis and Fallon created their company, Golden Glitch, with five others that had been part of the Game Creation Society, and worked on the project during nights and weekends while keeping their day jobs. The founders received no payment until after the game went on sale, and the team's four contractors were paid from their personal salaries from their other jobs. In 2015, Golden Glitch created a Kickstarter for Elsinore, which was successfully funded and raised over $32,000. Despite an original targeted release date of September 2016, the game was not released until 2019.  \nThe Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask provided inspiration for how to implement time loops in the game, and Golden Glitch drew inspiration from anime and visual novels which had many examples of time loops as a plot mechanic. Golden Glitch decided to focus on Ophelia as the protagonist because of her lack of agency in Hamlet. Her early exit by suicide in the play means that she is uninvolved in much of the action that comes later on, and it gave the development team room to try to make her a stronger character. The team also decided to make Opheila a woman of color, and created her with the idea that she was of Moorish descent through her mother's line. The writers believed that this modification and some others allowed them to ensure that all of the characters had more fleshed out and unique storylines.\n\n## Reception  \nPraise for the game was centered especially on the writing, and the mostly perceived success of adapting Hamlet towards a video game medium. Wireds Julie Muncy praised Elsinore for its \"beautiful writing\" and \"humanistic flourishes\". The Los Angeles Timess Todd Martens commented positively on the game's parallels with modern experiences. Polygons Cass Marshall compared the game positively to Long Live the Queen, but noted that unlike in that game, Elsinores mechanics meant that progress always felt positive, praising the deep levels of character that can be explored. GameSpots Phil Hornshaw listed the game in GameSpots \"Best of 2019: Editor's Spotlight Awards\" and praised the game for being full of \"well-executed ideas\".  \nCriticism for the game's long waiting periods was tempered by feelings on the overall game. Kotakus Heather Alexandra noted that the slow pace \"wouldn't be for everyone\" but felt that if players could make it through it, the game was a worthwhile experience. US Gamers Eric Van Allen noted that the waiting periods can \"grate\" after a while, but that the game was largely successful in creating a positive narrative experience.  \n### Accolades  \nThe game was nominated for \"Excellence in Design\" and \"Excellence in Narrative\" at the IGF Awards, and for \"Best Original Choral Composition\", \"Best Original Song\" with \"Fair as a Rose\", and \"Best Original Soundtrack Album\" at the 18th Annual G.A.N.G.

Through his positions in leading new music organizations and his wide-ranging contacts with British and European composers, he had a major impact on making contemporary classical music available to the British public for over 30 years. He was a leading figure in the BBC's Concerts of Contemporary Music between 1926 and 1939, and he played a significant role in the founding and early development of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He held prominent positions in the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) from its inception in 1922, and was its president from 1947 to 1952.  \nHe was responsible for producing a number of important world and British premieres (some of which he also conducted), and he was associated with most of the important European and British composers, such as Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, Ferruccio Busoni, Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith, William Walton, Arthur Bliss, Arnold Bax, Peter Warlock, John Ireland, Constant Lambert, Arthur Benjamin, Humphrey Searle, Denis ApIvor, Alan Rawsthorne, Benjamin Britten, Michael Tippett, Benjamin Frankel, Roberto Gerhard, Luigi Dallapiccola, Christian Darnton and others.  \nEdward Clark was described by some as Mephistophelean. He was outspoken, immensely erudite, and a visionary. But he was also a loose cannon when it came to administrative matters, tending to ruffle feathers with his too-individual approach, brooking no interference, and being distrustful of those who did not share his vision but often inadequately communicating that vision to them. In 1936 these matters contributed in large part to his premature departure from the BBC, and from the inner sanctum of the contemporary music scene, which he had helped to create as much as anyone, and more than most. His personal integrity in regard to the use of official funds also came under question more than once, in one instance leading to a public scandal and court case in which he sued Benjamin Frankel for slander.  \nClark's ex-wife Dorothy Eckersley was jailed in 1945 for making anti-British broadcasts over a German radio station during World War II; their teenage son James Clark was also involved in this. His second wife was the composer Elisabeth Lutyens, with whom he had another child.\n\n## Early life  \nThomas Edward Clark was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 10 May 1888. His father, James Bowness Clark (1863–1934), was a coal exporter and amateur musician who supported his son's musical interests and for two decades was the secretary of the Newcastle and Gateshead Choral Union. He and his wife Elizabeth née Thirlaway (1858–1939) had three children.  \nEdward Clark was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle. Studying in Paris in 1907 and 1908, he met Claude Debussy, Albert Roussel and Maurice Ravel. He returned to Newcastle and presented a paper called \"Paper on a Modern French Composer: Claude Debussy\"; at that time he formulated a strong desire to encourage British audiences \"to understand this music of to-day before it becomes the music of the day before yesterday\". In 1909 he studied conducting with Oskar Fried in Berlin while employed as the Berlin correspondent for The Musical Times.  \n## Meeting with Schoenberg and his circle  \nClark's first exposure to the music of Arnold Schoenberg was at a performance of his symphonic poem Pelleas und Melisande on 31 October 1910 at a concert by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Berlin. He was profoundly impressed by this music, and he was introduced to Schoenberg and Anton Webern after the concert. He became Schoenberg's champion and, along with people like Artur Schnabel, Ferruccio Busoni, Oskar Fried and others, he convinced him to move from Vienna to Berlin, because of the greater opportunities and contacts there. From 1910 until 1912 Clark studied with Schoenberg in Berlin, the only British student he ever had. At first Clark was his sole pupil, then he was joined by Eduard Steuermann, and others later. Clark arranged for Schoenberg to give a series of ten public lectures at the Stern Conservatory (\"10 Lectures on the Aesthetics of Music and the Rules of Composition\"), which he also attended. He helped raise funds for Schoenberg, and played a part in having his Five Pieces for Orchestra published in a cheap edition, which sold out quickly. One of the purchasers was Sir Henry Wood.  \nOn 3 September 1912, Wood conducted the world premiere of the Five Pieces for Orchestra at a Promenade Concert at the Queen's Hall in London. At Wood's suggestion, Clark invited Schoenberg to make his British conducting debut, and on 17 January 1914 he conducted the same work at the same venue.  \nClark attended the Leipzig premiere of Gurre-Lieder in January 1914 along with Schoenberg, Webern and others. He had been considering settling permanently in Germany, and the matter was decided when he was offered a professional post in Stettin. In early August 1914 he was attending the Bayreuth Festival, on his way to take up that appointment, when World War I broke out. He was arrested at Bayreuth as an enemy alien, and interned at Ruhleben internment camp near Berlin; Edgar Bainton, his colleague from Newcastle, was also interned at that time, as were Ernest MacMillan, Arthur Benjamin and others. Clark was released in May 1918 through the offices of the Red Cross.  \nOn his return to London, he became assistant conductor to Ernest Ansermet and Adrian Boult for Sergei Diaghilev's seasons of the Ballets Russes, and he became friendly with Diaghilev and Igor Stravinsky. In the winter and spring of 1921 he presented two series of concerts of new music, which proved very popular but made him little money. On 8 April at the Queen's Hall he presented the UK premiere of Stravinsky's 1919 Suite from The Firebird, and two world premieres: Arnold Bax's The Bard of the Dimbovitza, song cycle with orchestra, with Ethel Fenton (mezzo-soprano) and the \"Storm Music\" from Arthur Bliss's incidental music for The Tempest.  \nOn 20 April 1921 Arthur Bliss's Conversations for string quartet had its world premiere at a Clark concert. On 6 May 1921 he presented Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1, Op. 9, to British audiences for the first time, at the Aeolian Hall. The players were Charles Woodhouse (violin), John Barbirolli (cello), Léon Goossens (oboe), and Aubrey Brain and Alfred Brain (horns). This was part of a series of four concerts of recent works by French, German and English composers, many of them first English performances. On 20 May 1921 he conducted the British premiere of Manuel de Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain, with the composer at the piano.  \nClark attended the inaugural session of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) in Salzburg in 1922, and remained a significant figure in the organisation for the rest of his life.  \nIn August 1921 he married Dorothy (\"Dolly\") Stephen, and their son James Royston Clark was born in 1923.  \n## British Broadcasting Corporation  \nClark was hired by the BBC in August 1924 as Musical Director for their Newcastle station. His imagination, creativity and innovative approaches to programming were soon noted, attracting praise from local Newcastle musical circles; but so too were his administrative shortcomings. In December 1924, in Newcastle, Clark conducted the world premiere of the orchestral version of Arnold Schoenberg's Verklärte Nacht. The Newcastle station orchestra was disbanded at the end of 1926, and Clark transferred to London in January 1927 as a programme planner, at the request of Percy Pitt.  \nAlthough he was employed full-time by the BBC for only another seven years, it was primarily through his influence that the BBC became established as an international patron of new music. He also did a considerable amount of conducting during this period, sometimes of the works he was producing for the BBC, and sometimes on a free-lance basis.  \nOn 19 June 1927 he conducted the British premiere of Igor Stravinsky's Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments, with the composer (in his British radio debut) and the Wireless Symphony Orchestra. On 10–12 July 1927 he conducted three fully staged performances of L'Histoire du soldat at the Arts Theatre Club; they were sung in English and the third performance was broadcast. Clark had also performed this work in its British premiere in the autumn of 1926 in Newcastle.  \nIn November of that year he was able to secure Oskar Fried his first British conducting engagement (the programme included Weber, Brahms and Liszt). Clark invited Schoenberg to London to conduct the first British performance of his Gurre-Lieder on 27 January 1928, and assisted with the rehearsals. (He had tried to have the premiere the previous year, on 14 April 1927, but these plans fell through.)  \nIn April 1929, Edward Clark along with Julian Herbage of the BBC's Music Department devised a plan for a 114-piece orchestra that was especially suited to broadcasting, and one that could be split into four different smaller groups as required. This was the original workable concept for the BBC Symphony Orchestra after some earlier ideas from Sir Thomas Beecham foundered. Beecham was the first choice for chief conductor, but he withdrew and Adrian Boult directed the orchestra for the next 20 years. Boult did not always support Clark's choices of repertoire, however. He refused to play the music of Alexander Scriabin that Clark programmed, calling it \"evil music\", and even issued a ban on Scriabin's music from broadcasts in the 1930s. It is also true that he had no personal sympathy with the music of the Second Viennese School, describing Alban Berg's Lyric Suite as \"a Kensington drawing room apology for what Berg really meant\", but Clark's influence was such that he was at least prepared to participate in performances of this music.  \nIt was Clark who suggested to William Walton that he invite Paul Hindemith to be the soloist at the premiere of his Viola Concerto in 1929, when the dedicatee Lionel Tertis declined. Tertis also claimed to have suggested Hindemith in his place, but Walton confirmed it was Clark's idea. Walton was initially somewhat reluctant to invite Hindemith, as he felt he had modelled the concerto too closely after the latter's style, which he would quickly recognise; but thanks to Edward Clark, the invitation was sent and accepted, the premiere took place on 3 October, and the two composers became lifelong friends (they had met briefly in 1923).  \nClark played an even greater role in Walton's Belshazzar's Feast: he was its progenitor. On 21 August 1929 he asked Walton for a work suitable for broadcasting, written for a small choir, soloist, and an orchestra not exceeding 15 players. Walton later thanked Clark for bringing Belshazzar's Feast to the attention of Sergei Prokofiev, who showed some interest in it.  \nHis friend John Ireland introduced Alan Bush to Clark, who was responsible for having many of Bush's works broadcast between 1929 and 1936.  \nOn 3 March 1930, Edward Clark played a major part in the first complete broadcast (18 poems) of Walton's Façade, at the Central Hall, Westminster, with Edith Sitwell and Constant Lambert (speakers), Leslie Heward conducting.  \nOn 9 January 1931, Schoenberg conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the British premiere of Erwartung. Clark was able to use the prestige and contacts he had by now built up to secure the ISCM Festival for London and Oxford in July 1931.  \nAs well as Schoenberg, Clark invited Anton Webern and Alban Berg to visit England several times to conduct their own works. Berg was very reluctant, insisting he was no conductor. Clark nevertheless made sure his major works received performances in England: the Lyric Suite and Chamber Concerto (21 April 1933); the Wozzeck fragments (13 May 1932), and complete in concert performance (14 March 1934); Der Wein; the Symphonic Pieces from Lulu (20 March 1935; this was the first time Berg had ever heard this music (by radio broadcast); he was not to hear a live performance of it until 11 December in Vienna, a fortnight before his death); and, posthumously, the Violin Concerto.  \nBetween November 1932 and January 1933, while staying in Barcelona, Schoenberg wrote a transcription for cello and orchestra of the Keyboard Concerto in D by Georg Matthias Monn. He wrote it for Pablo Casals, to whom he offered the first performance, but Casals declined. It received its first public airing on 3 February (or 5 February) 1933 in an afternoon studio broadcast from London by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Edward Clark, with the soloist Antoni Sala. There was no announcement of this world premiere and there is no extant documentation of the broadcast. Schoenberg was probably in attendance; he was in London to conduct the BBC Symphony Orchestra's world premiere (broadcast) performance of the Variations, Op. 31.  \nOn 1 March 1933, just four weeks after Adolf Hitler had become German Chancellor, Schoenberg resigned from his teaching post in the face of imminent dismissal for being part of what Hitler had described as \"the Jewish stranglehold on Western music\". He moved to Paris on 16 May, intending to remain there, but he had no luck in securing a French publisher or any conducting opportunities. He wrote to Edward Clark by postcard later that month, asking him to use his contacts to get him some performances of the Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra, and a British publisher for that work and the Cello Concerto. He was also seeking to have his Jewish drama, written 1925–26, be published by a British Jewish publisher. Clark approached a number of people on Schoenberg's behalf, but received only knockbacks. He did, however, arrange for two concerts in November, in which Pierrot Lunaire and the Suite, Op. 29 would receive performances. But it was not to be. Schoenberg received an offer of a teaching post at a Boston music academy, and decided to quit Europe, sailing for the United States on 25 October 1933.  \nClark was in Moscow in January 1934, where he conducted John Ireland's Piano Concerto in E-flat major. On 8 February 1935 he conducted the first British broadcast of Kurt Weill's Die Dreigroschenoper. It received scathing reviews from Ernest Newman and other critics. But the most savage criticism came from Weill himself, who described it privately as \"the worst performance imaginable... the whole thing was completely misunderstood\". But his criticisms seem to have been for the concept of the piece as a Germanised version of The Beggar's Opera, rather than for Clark's conducting of it, of which Weill made no mention.  \nAlso in 1935 he chose Harriet Cohen to perform new Soviet music by Dmitri Shostakovich, Dmitry Kabalevsky, Leonid Polovinkin and Georgy Kh. Mepurnov in London. The same year he was instrumental in arranging a series of BBC broadcasts, in which the émigré German composer and musicologist Ernst Hermann Meyer was engaged to present important revivals of 17th century consort music.  \nClark was responsible for bringing Béla Bartók to Britain to perform his works at the Proms, such as the Piano Concerto No. 2 on 7 January 1936 under Sir Henry Wood. Through Clark's endeavours the world premiere concert performance of Schoenberg's Variations, Op. 31, took place in Vienna in 1936 under the BBC Symphony Orchestra.  \nEdward Clark may have suggested Benjamin Britten's name to Alberto Cavalcanti of the GPO Film Unit as a young composer he should consider for film scores. This led to Britten's score for Night Mail (1936). Clark had planned to have the world premiere of Britten's Cantique d'amour presented by the BBC in 1936, but perceptions about Britten's personal morality led to the plan being shelved, to Clark's chagrin.  \nUnder the direction of Edward Clark and Constant Lambert, some of Bernard van Dieren's larger works were performed by the BBC in the composer's last years, and just after his death in 1936.  \nOn 19 January 1936, Hindemith travelled to London, intending to play the British premiere of his viola concerto Der Schwanendreher, with Adrian Boult and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Queen's Hall on 22 January. However, just before midnight on 20 January, King George V died. The concert was cancelled, but Boult and Clark still wanted Hindemith's involvement in any music that was broadcast in its place. They debated for hours what might be a suitable piece, but nothing could be found, so it was decided that Hindemith should write something new. The following day, from 11 am to 5 pm, Hindemith sat in an office made available to him by the BBC and wrote Trauermusik in homage to the late king. It, too, was written for viola and orchestra. It was performed that evening in a live broadcast from a BBC radio studio, with Boult conducting and the composer as soloist.  \n### Resignation from the BBC  \n<image>Arnold Schoenberg, 1927, by Man Ray\nClark resigned angrily and abruptly from the BBC on 16 March 1936. The immediate cause of this protest was some alterations to the concert programmes for the BBC Symphony Orchestra's forthcoming European tour, in which he had invested much time and great care. These changes were made without his knowledge and while he was on sick leave, and they included the complete removal of Béla Bartók's Four Orchestral Pieces from the Budapest programme.  \nHowever, this parting of the ways suited many people in the BBC, as it came in the wake of very strong criticism that had been building over a long time about Clark's poor work habits, his general inefficiency, his unpunctuality and missing of important deadlines, his administrative bungling and his unwillingness to communicate with his colleagues about what he was doing, thinking or planning. His dismissal had been considered more than once. His conducting was also the subject of criticism, on the basis that he could not quickly establish rapport with or give strong and unambiguous directions to his players, and he was discouraged from this activity. His personal integrity had also come under question: He took sick leave in 1928 due to severe rheumatism that necessitated having his affected arm in a sling, but while on leave he conducted orchestras in both London and Prague. Then there was a trip to Europe to negotiate with Arturo Toscanini about his involvement in the forthcoming BBC Symphony Orchestra's appearances at the Florence May Festival; Clark changed his travel arrangements at the last minute, he stayed a week longer than he was scheduled to, he still did not complete the task he was sent to do, and the rocky relationship Toscanini already had with the BBC was further soured. Adrian Boult backed Clark to the hilt, saying he had done a very good job in very difficult circumstances; but it was too late.  \nClark never worked in a steady job again, although he was a consultant to the BBC on certain projects, and continued to conduct on a free-lance basis for a few years until the work dried up.\n\n## After the BBC  \nEdward Clark's departure had the effect of relegating Schoenberg, Webern, Berg and other members of the Second Viennese School to fringe composers as far as British audiences were concerned, and they were not brought back into the mainstream until William Glock's appointment in 1959. The BBC Symphony Orchestra's repertoire was similarly affected; it became more focused on the works of Romantic and post-Romantic composers for the next 25 years, leaving contemporary music to struggle for limited hearings. \"Tonality had returned to the airwaves\", to the relief of many.  \nBut Clark himself remained busy with the ISCM and other activities. On 19 April 1936 he was at the ISCM Festival in Barcelona for the world premiere of Berg's Violin Concerto, played by Louis Krasner. He arranged for Krasner to come to Britain for the local premiere; in the event, it was a private studio performance on 1 May, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Anton Webern, who had gone to Barcelona to conduct the world premiere but withdrew at the last minute, fortunately proved up to the task on this occasion.  \nClark's influence was not confined to Britain and Europe. The Australian pianist and composer Roy Agnew heard some of Clark's broadcasts while he was in Britain in the 1920s. He was part of the network of like-minded people who spread the word about emerging compositions throughout the English-speaking world. Between 1937 and 1942 Agnew broadcast his own radio programme, \"Modern and Contemporary Music\", for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This was no doubt strongly influenced by Clark's programmes.  \nClark produced concert versions of Ferruccio Busoni's Doktor Faust (1937) and Arlecchino (1939), many years before the British stage premiere of either work.  \n## Elisabeth Lutyens  \nIn 1938 Edward Clark met the composer Elisabeth Lutyens. In quick succession they became lovers, she left her husband Ian Glennie, she and Clark had a child (her fourth), and they married in 1942. They spent the war years in Newcastle, where he founded the North East Regional Orchestra (NERO).  \nLutyens was equally well connected with the musical establishment, and was also a friend of Igor Stravinsky. Clark's influence may have been a decisive factor in her adopting serial techniques. It is certainly the case that her first truly serial composition, the Chamber Concerto No. 1, was completed in 1939, the year after she and Clark became partners, and she dedicated it to him.  \nBut because he was mostly unemployed now, this meant that Lutyens was the main bread winner for the family of six, and she took on certain commissions she might otherwise have declined. These included her film scores, which have received latter-day recognition as among her finest creations. She was also prepared to scrub floors to help make ends meet; but Clark would consider nothing but conducting, even though all offers dried up early. He was essentially unemployed for the last 23 years of his life. Lutyens said that she hated writing her 1972 autobiography A Goldfish Bowl, and only did so to record Clark's earlier achievements.  \nIn 1945, William Walton was able to repay Clark's good work from the Viola Concerto premiere in 1929. Elisabeth Lutyens approached Walton for an introduction to Muir Mathieson with a view to getting some film music work. He readily agreed to pass on her name, but he went a step further. He invited Lutyens to write any work she liked, dedicate it to him and he would pay her £100 sight unseen. The work she wrote was The Pit. Clark conducted The Pit at the 1946 ISCM Festival in London, along with her Three Symphonic Preludes.  \n## Later life  \nPoster for Edward Clark concert, Moscow If not a communist, Clark was always a dedicated socialist, and he was a member of the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR (now the Society for Co-operation in Russian and Soviet Studies, SCRSS). It was in this capacity that in March 1940 he approached firstly Clifford Curzon, who declined, and then Moura Lympany, who agreed, to be the soloist at the UK premiere of Aram Khachaturian's Piano Concerto in D-flat. The work was still in manuscript, and there was only one month in which to learn it. The concert was at the Queen's Hall on 13 April 1940, and the orchestra was conducted by Clark's friend and committed communist Alan Bush.  \nIn 1945–46 he presented three concerts at the Wigmore Hall in London, of music by British and European composers. He organised the 1946 London ISCM Festival, a year before being elected the organisation's third President. He been active with the ISCM since its inception in 1922, as Chairman of the British Chapter. He was also associated with the London Contemporary Music Centre 1947–52 (where the Australian composer Don Banks was his secretary), and music adviser to the Institute for Contemporary Arts from its inception in 1948. Humphrey Searle became the ISCM's General Secretary with Clark's support.  \nIn 1946 Clark attended the first performance of Denis ApIvor's Lorca songs at a concert for the Society for the Promotion of New Music. He was impressed, and included these songs in a London Contemporary Music concert at the Wigmore Hall in 1947. Later that same year, Clark produced ApIvor's Violin Sonata, Op. 9 played by Antonio Brosa and Kyla Greenbaum. It was through Clark that ApIvor became interested in serialism.  \nHis administrative skills never improved. In 1947, Peggy Glanville-Hicks, President of the United States branch of the ISCM, was forced to write sharply to him to protest about unanswered correspondence in which the Americans had asked that the ISCM Festival scheduled for June 1948 in Amsterdam be held as late as possible in the month, in order to allow them the chance to attend, given their existing university teaching commitments. In the event, the US branch withdrew from the festival, but Glanville-Hicks attended in her personal capacity.  \nIn 1948, for the BBC's Third Programme, Clark presented \"Turning Points in Twentieth-Century Music\", a series of eight programmes of his own creation, which looked at the composers Schoenberg, Stravinsky and Bartók.  \nHe gave the Commemoration Speech before the London Opera Guild's 'Arnold Schoenberg Memorial Concert' on 16 December 1951.  \nIn 1953 Sir William Walton used his contacts to secure a Civil List pension for Clark.  \nIn 1955, Benjamin Frankel succeeded Clark as Chairman of the ISCM. That year issues arose about certain expenses Clark had claimed while he was Chairman. Clark alleged that Frankel had falsely accused him of fraud. Frankel denied he had ever made any such claim, but nevertheless said that such a claim, had he made it, would have been true. This amounted to slander as far as Clark was concerned, and he sued Frankel in the High Court. As part of the arguments, various allegations of communist sub-plots were given an airing. While Frankel's alleged slander itself was unproven, the jury exonerated Clark of any wrongdoing and he felt this meant his integrity was intact. Elisabeth Lutyens ever after referred to Frankel as \"composer and ex-colleague\".  \nIn 1960 and 1961 he used his influence to have Denis ApIvor's opera Yerma broadcast by the BBC after the Sadler's Wells Theatre refused to mount the production (even though it had been commissioned by the Sadler's Wells Trust). It was conducted by Sir Eugene Goossens.  \nEdward Clark died suddenly of a coronary thrombosis in London on 30 April 1962, aged 73. Stravinsky wept on hearing of Clark's death.  \n## Honours  \nIn 1951 the Internationale Gesellschaft für Neue Musik (IGNM) awarded Edward Clark the Arnold Schoenberg Medal.  \nClark is one of a select band of Honorary Members of the ISCM.  \n## Works dedicated to Edward Clark  \n* John Ireland's Piano Sonatina (1926–27) and a numberdate=April 2015 from his cycle Songs Sacred and Profane (1929).  \n* Alan Bush's Dance Overture for Military Band (1930).  \n* Józef Koffler, the first Polish twelve-tone composer, dedicated his \"Variations on a Waltz by Johann Strauss\", Op. 23 (1935) \"À mon ami Edward Clark\".  \n* Anton Webern's orchestration of the Ricercare from Johann Sebastian Bach's The Musical Offering  \n* Elisabeth Lutyens' first truly serial composition, the Chamber Concerto No. 1, was completed in 1939, the year after she and Clark became partners, and she dedicated it to him.  \n* Humphrey Searle wrote a musical palindrome for Clark, his Quartet for clarinet, bassoon, violin and viola, Op. 12.  \n* Constant Lambert's Trois pièces nègres pour les touches blanches, for piano 4-hands (1949).  \n* After his death, Elisabeth Lutyens dedicated Music for Orchestra II (1962) to his memory. However, it had been sketched well before Clark's death, and she denied the chorale ending was in any way a tribute to him. But she did acknowledge she had made an annotation at bars 184–185 of the score, marking the moment of Clark's death.  \n## Personal life  \n### Dorothy Stephen  \nOn 10 August 1921 he married Frances Dorothy (\"Dolly\") Stephen (18 December 1893 – 1971), who was related to the literary Stephen family (including Sir Leslie Stephen and his daughter Virginia Woolf). Clark's and Dolly's son James Royston Clark was born in 1923. Dolly left him in the summer of 1925, taking James with her.  \n#### The Eckersley affair  \nDolly later went to work for the BBC as a secretary, and had an affair with Clark's colleague, the engineer Peter Eckersley. This seemed to have Clark's blessing, as on one occasion he even arranged for Eckersley to visit Germany on BBC business, and for Dolly to accompany him. Eckersley was married, but although he and Dolly made no secret of their liaison, his wife Stella was unaware. It was Muriel Reith, the wife of the BBC Director-General John Reith, who broke the news to her. John Reith was strictly puritanical about such matters (although his own private life was questionable), and he was most unwilling to have a senior staff member on the payroll who was known to be conducting an adulterous affair or in the process of divorcing his own wife. Top level conferences were held; the Archbishop of Canterbury was even consulted. However, Eckersley was not sacked immediately, as he undertook to end the affair with Dolly Clark and return to his wife. But nature took its course, he and Dolly reunited, and he resigned in April 1929. The Eckersley affair prompted a public enquiry into the BBC's personnel practices.  \nDolly Clark and Peter Eckersley were married on 25 October 1930.  \n#### Dolly Eckersley's German sojourn  \nShe had always been very much pro-Nazi in her politics. She was known as a strongly pro-German fascist and a fanatical admirer of Adolf Hitler. She was a friend of William Joyce (\"Lord Haw-Haw\") and Unity Mitford, and a member of Arnold Leese's Imperial Fascist League. Peter Eckersley himself held similar opinions. After they met Sir Oswald Mosley, he became involved in his New Party, chairing its London Central Committee. He travelled throughout Europe constantly in a quest to expand the reach of international radio broadcasts; he claimed there were no sinister political motives behind his activities, but that they were simply his attempt to make himself very rich. From November 1939 the transmitter he had arranged to put in place at Osterloog transmitting station, which became the vehicle for William Joyce's broadcasts to Britain and Europe. Joyce was later hanged for treason, and Eckersley has been described as \"at best a foolish Fascist fellow traveller and at worst a traitor\". As for Dolly, she joined Mosley's British Union of Fascists, but outdid Mosley in her enthusiasm for the Nazi concept of fascism. She also joined the National Socialist League, which had been founded by William Joyce after he was expelled by Mosley for being too anti-semitic.  \nThe Eckersleys took their holidays in Germany a number of times, and attended the Nuremberg rallies in 1937 and 1938. In July 1939 Dorothy took her and Edward Clark's 16-year-old son James to a Nuremberg rally, and also attended the Salzburg Festival. She had a chance encounter with William Joyce in August and got him a job as a radio announcer and scriptwriter. When Britain declared war in September, she felt no need to return to her own country but decided to stay. James was enrolled in a German school, and gained \"a very favourable impression of Germany under Nazi rule\". In December 1939 she commenced work for the radio station Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (RRG), a propaganda machine for Joseph Goebbels. She was initially employed as an English-language announcer and later on office duties. James, although only aged 16, was taken out of school to also be a newsreader there. He changed his name to Richard, to sound less Jewish and more Wagnerian. He worked there on and off until July 1942; she continued until January 1943. For obscure reasons they were arrested by the Gestapo in December 1944 and incarcerated till the end of the war. They were liberated by the British, but promptly re-arrested. They were both tried in London in October 1945 for assisting the enemy by broadcasting. Dorothy was found guilty and sentenced to one year in prison. James, still only 22, pleaded he had been hypnotised as an impressionable youth by the trappings and tricks of Nazi propaganda; this was accepted, and he was bound over for two years.  \nDorothy Eckersley died in 1971. James Clark became an editor and translator and died in 2012.  \n### Elisabeth Lutyens  \nIn 1938 Edward Clark met the composer Elisabeth Lutyens, who was married to the baritone Ian Glennie. She and Clark quickly became lovers, and later that year she left Glennie for Clark, taking her and Glennie's three children (a son and twin daughters) with her. In 1941 Clark gave her a fourth child (a son, Conrad) before marrying her on 9 May 1942.  \nTheir son Conrad Clark became a sculptor, designer and painter; he moved to Australia and now lives in Melbourne.  \n## Premieres conducted by Edward Clark  \n### World premieres  \n* Arnold Bax:  \n* * The Bard of the Dimbovitza, song cycle with orchestra, original version, 8 April 1921, Queen's Hall, Ethel Fenton (mezzo-soprano)  \n* Arthur Bliss  \n* * The Tempest, storm music, 8 April 1921, Queen's Hall, Harriet Cohen (pianist)  \n* * Rout, soprano and orchestra, 6 May 1921, Aeolian Hall  \n* Arnold Schoenberg:  \n* * Verklärte Nacht, orchestral version, December 1924, Newcastle upon Tyne  \n* * Cello Concerto in D (transcription of Keyboard Concerto in D by Georg Matthias Monn), studio broadcast, 3 or 5 February 1933, Antoni Sala (cello), BBC Symphony Orchestra  \n### British premieres  \n* Frederick Delius:  \n* * first broadcast performance of In a Summer Garden  \n* * first broadcast performance of North Country Sketches  \n* * first broadcast performance of Legende for violin and orchestra (1924;

She is best known for her time in WWE, where she performed from 2009 to 2022 under the ring name Naomi. She is signed to Impact Wrestling, performing under the mononym Trinity. She is the current Impact Knockouts World Champion in her first reign.  \nIn August 2009, Naomi signed with WWE. She was assigned to its former developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where she was the inaugural FCW Divas Champion. In August 2010, Naomi competed in the all-female third season of NXT, where she finished in second place. She then made her main roster debut alongside Cameron as The Funkadactyls in January 2012. From 2014 to 2015, she was an on-screen manager for The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso). As a solo competitor, Naomi held the SmackDown Women's Championship two times. With Sasha Banks, she obtained the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship in 2022. A month later, Naomi and Banks received indefinite suspensions from WWE after the two walked out due to a creative dispute. Naomi stated in 2023 that she had departed the company and later performed as part of Impact Wrestling.  \nOutside of wrestling, Naomi danced for the basketball team the Orlando Magic as well as rapper Flo Rida. She appeared as one of the main cast members of WWE's reality television series Total Divas from 2013 to 2019 and acted in the 2017 film The Marine 5: Battleground.  \n## Early life  \nTrinity McCray was born in Sanford, Florida. She graduated from Oviedo High School Before starting a career in wrestling, she was one of the dancers for the basketball team the Orlando Magic. She also starred as a background dancer for rapper Flo Rida.  \n## Professional wrestling career  \n### World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE)  \n#### Developmental territories (2009–2011)  \nIn August 2009, Fatu signed a contract with WWE, where she reported to their then-developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). On June 20, 2010, Naomi defeated Serena Deeb on FCW TV to become the inaugural FCW Divas Champion. On the August 29 episode of FCW TV, Naomi competed in a match against AJ Lee, where both the Queen of FCW title and the FCW Divas Championship were on the line, which ended in a double count-out. Naomi joined the all-female third season of NXT in 2010, with Kelly Kelly as her pro. Naomi debuted on the September 7 episode of NXT, where she teamed with Kelly to defeat Alicia Fox and fellow rookie Maxine after Naomi pinned Maxine. On the September 21 episode of NXT, she teamed with Kelly and Jamie Keyes, defeating Layla, Michelle McCool, and Kaitlyn. On the October 26 episode of NXT, Naomi defeated Maxine in a singles match. On November 30, Naomi lost the competition to Kaitlyn, placing second in the season. On the January 23, 2011, Naomi lost the championship to Lee on FCW TV.  \n#### The Funkadactyls (2012–2014)  \n<image>Naomi (left) at the ring along Brodus Clay, dance partner Cameron, and Hornswoggle (front) in April 2012\nOn January 9, 2012, Naomi made her main roster debut on Raw alongside Cameron as valets for Brodus Clay, with the duo dubbed The Funkadactyls. On the TLC pre-show on December 16, Naomi scored a victory in a Santa's Little Helpers battle royal, earning a match against Divas Champion Eve Torres later that night, where she lost. On the March 15, 2013, episode of SmackDown, The Funkadactyls were attacked backstage by The Bella Twins. The Funkadactyls, Clay, and Tensai, collectively known as Tons of Funk, were originally set to face Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow) and the Bella Twins in an eight-person mixed tag team match at WrestleMania 29, but after the match was cut due to time constraints, it instead took place the following night on Raw, with Tons of Funk coming out victorious.  \nOn the August 26 episode of Raw, Naomi was ringside for a match between Natalya and Brie Bella alongside the cast of Total Divas, also including Cameron, Nikki Bella, Eva Marie, and JoJo Offerman, which ended with Divas Champion AJ Lee coming out and cutting a worked shoot promo directed at the women. On the September 15, Naomi competed against Natalya, Brie Bella, and Lee in a fatal four-way match for the Divas Championship at Night of Champions, where Lee retained the title. The cast of Total Divas went on to defeat Lee, Alicia Fox, Aksana, Kaitlyn, Rosa Mendes, Tamina Snuka, and Summer Rae in a traditional elimination tag team match at Survivor Series. On December 15 at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, Naomi, Cameron and Tensai abandoned Clay due to his attitude.  \nIn February 2014, Naomi suffered a legitimate displaced fracture of the orbital bone during a match against Aksana on Raw. She returned on the March 17 episode of Raw, teaming with Cameron to defeat Lee and Snuka in a tag team match. On April 6 at WrestleMania XXX, Naomi competed in the Vickie Guerrero Invitational match for the Lee's Divas Championship, where Lee successfully retained her title. At Money in the Bank, Naomi lost to the new Divas Champion Paige in a title match. On the July 7 episode of Raw, Naomi and Cameron lost to Lee and Paige in a tag team match, which caused a brawl to ensue between Cameron and Naomi. Naomi and Cameron faced off on the Battleground pre-show, during which the former lost. Naomi went on to secure a victory over Cameron on the September 15 episode of Raw. At Survivor Series, Naomi participated in a traditional elimination tag team match, where she eliminated Cameron before eventually pinning Paige to get the win for her team in a clean sweep.\n\n#### Divas Revolution (2014–2016)  \nIn December 2014, Naomi became involved with The Usos' feud with The Miz, which involved The Miz offering to help further Naomi's musical career, much to her husband Jimmy Uso's dismay. On the December 16 episode of Super SmackDown, Naomi competed against Nikki Bella for the Divas Championship, where she lost the match after Jimmy Uso caused a distraction due to his anger of The Miz being present. After Alicia Fox joined The Miz and Mizdow, Naomi and the Usos competed against the three in a series of mixed tag team matches, where Naomi's team repeatedly lost. On March 29, she accompanied The Usos during their match on the WrestleMania 31 pre-show, in which they unsuccessfully challenged Kidd and Cesaro for the WWE Tag Team Championship.  \nOn the April 13 episode of Raw, Naomi unsuccessfully competed in a battle royal to determine the number one contender to the Divas Championship. After the bout, Naomi attacked Paige for eliminating her to ultimately win the match, turning heel. As Paige had been injured by the attack, Naomi was granted a match against Bella for the title at Extreme Rules, where she failed to win after interference from Brie Bella. In May, Naomi attacked The Bella Twins alongside the returning Tamina. The duo went on to compete in a tag team match against The Bella Twins at Payback, during which Naomi and Tamina won. On the May 18 episode of Raw, Naomi competed in another championship match against Nikki Bella, where Bella retained the title after Tamina caused a disqualification. After Paige returned, a triple threat match was made between Naomi, Paige, and Nikki Bella at Elimination Chamber, however she once again failed to capture the title.  \n<image>Naomi (front center) alongside fellow Team B.A.D. & Blonde members at WrestleMania 32 event in April 2016\nOn the July 13 episode of Raw, after weeks of the Divas division being dominated by The Bella Twins and their ally Alicia Fox, Stephanie McMahon called for a \"Divas Revolution\", subsequently introducing the debuting NXT Women's Champion Sasha Banks to align with Naomi and Tamina, dubbed Team B.A.D., as well as Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch to align with Paige, leading to a brawl between the three teams. The three teams faced off in a three team elimination match on August 23 at SummerSlam, which was won by Team PCB. At the 2015 Tribute to the Troops in December, Team B.A.D. and Paige defeated Brie Bella, Charlotte, Fox, and Lynch in an eight-woman tag team match. On the February 1, 2016, episode of Raw, Banks left the team, which caused Naomi and Tamina to attack her. Naomi and Tamina later lost to Banks and Lynch in a tag team match at Fastlane. On the WrestleMania 32 pre-show, Naomi and Tamina teamed up with Lana, Emma, and Summer Rae in a 10-Diva tag team match against Brie Bella, Paige, Fox, Eva Marie, and Natalya, where Naomi's team was defeated. In early May, Naomi became inactive due to a torn ankle tendon.\n\n#### SmackDown Women's Champion (2016–2017)  \nNaomi was drafted to the SmackDown brand on July 19 as part of the 2016 WWE draft. She then debuted a new gimmick, which included a new look and entrance, dubbed \"The Glow\". On August 21 at SummerSlam, Naomi competed in a six-woman tag team match alongside Becky Lynch and Carmella against Natalya, Alexa Bliss, and Nikki Bella, where Naomi's team was defeated after Bella pinned Carmella. On September 11 at Backlash, Naomi competed in a six-pack elimination challenge to determine the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion, where she would eliminate Bliss before she herself was eliminated by Natalya. On November 20, Naomi competed as part of the SmackDown women's team against the Raw women's team at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, where Naomi's team was defeated.  \nAfter two months of inactivity, Naomi returned on the January 24, 2017, episode of SmackDown, in a confrontation against SmackDown Women's Champion Bliss. On February 12, she competed against Bliss at Elimination Chamber, where she was victorious, becoming the SmackDown Women's Champion for the first time in her career as well as the first African-American woman to capture the title. The following Tuesday, she relinquished the title due to a legitimate injury she sustained during the match. On April 2, Naomi made her in-ring return in a six-pack challenge in her hometown of Orlando at WrestleMania 33, where she made Bliss submit, successfully regaining the SmackDown Women's Championship. Two days later, Naomi defeated Bliss in a rematch to retain the championship.  \nOn June 18, Naomi defeated Lana to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship at Money in the Bank. She then went on to retain the title over Lana two more times on the June 27 and July 4 episodes of SmackDown, the latter of which involved a seven-second submission victory. In June, Naomi debuted a customized title belt with glow-in-the-dark lights of various colors. On August 20 at SummerSlam, Naomi dropped the SmackDown Women's Championship to Natalya, ending her reign at 140 days. On November 19 at Survivor Series, Naomi competed in a five-on-five elimination tag team match, where she eliminated Raw team captain Alicia Fox, before she herself was eliminated by Sasha Banks, with her team ultimately losing the match.  \n#### Various storylines and departure (2018–2022)  \nOn January 28, 2018, Naomi competed in the inaugural women's Royal Rumble match at the namesake pay-per-view, entering at number 20 and lasting 06:49 before she was eliminated by Nia Jax. On the WrestleMania 34 kick-off show, Naomi went on to win the inaugural WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal by eliminating Bayley. In June, Naomi competed in her first Money in the Bank ladder match at the namesake pay-per-view, won by Alexa Bliss. On October 28, she took part in the first all-women's pay-per-view, Evolution, competing in a women's battle royal match, which was won by Jax. In November at Survivor Series, she competed in a traditional elimination tag team match as part of Team SmackDown, where she was the first woman eliminated from the match by Tamina.  \nNaomi then entered a feud with Mandy Rose after Rose started flirting with Naomi's real-life husband, Jimmy Uso, to \"ruin Naomi's life\", which involved Rose hinting at kissing Uso as well as Naomi attacking Rose in a hotel room to which Rose invited Uso. At Royal Rumble on January 27, 2019, Naomi and Rose eliminated each other during the women's Royal Rumble match. The two exchanged victories over each other in February. That same month, Naomi teamed up with Carmella in a six-team Elimination Chamber match for the inaugural WWE Women's Tag Team Championship at the namesake pay-per-view, where they were the first team eliminated. During the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up on April 15, Naomi was drafted to the Raw brand. She unsuccessfully competed in the women's Money in the Bank ladder match at the namesake pay-per-view the following month.  \nAt Royal Rumble on January 26, 2020, Naomi returned from a hiatus by entering the Royal Rumble match at number 18, lasting 22 minutes before being eliminated by Shayna Baszler. She later attributed her time away to health issues and a relative's death. The following month, Naomi lost to Bayley in a match for the SmackDown Women's Championship at Super Showdown. In April at WrestleMania 36, Naomi competed in a five-way elimination match for the same title, during which she was eliminated by Sasha Banks.

She teamed with Lana to compete in a tag team turmoil match during the first night of WrestleMania 37 to determine the No. 1 contenders for the Women's Tag Team Championship, where the duo was defeated. In August 2021, Naomi became part of the SmackDown roster. She subsequently began a feud with Sonya Deville, who was an authority figure. The feud developed due to Naomi's persistence in asking for matches, irritating Deville. Naomi and Deville eliminated each other from the Royal Rumble match at the namesake event in January 2022. Naomi teamed up with Ronda Rousey to defeat Deville and Charlotte Flair at Elimination Chamber the next month.  \nOn the second night of WrestleMania 38, Naomi teamed with Sasha Banks to compete in a four-way tag team match for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, in which they defeated the respective teams of Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley, Natalya and Shayna Baszler, and titleholders Carmella and Queen Zelina to become the new WWE Women's Tag Team Champions. During the May 16 episode of Raw, Naomi and Banks legitimately walked out of the show's venue over a creative dispute after a meeting with CEO Vince McMahon. This caused a change to the show's main event that originally involved both women. Naomi and Banks consequently received indefinite suspensions, and the title was vacated. In March 2023, Naomi stated she was no longer with WWE.  \n### Impact Wrestling (2023–present)  \nOn April 28, 2023, Fatu made her Impact Wrestling debut during the tapings of Impact!, which aired on tape delay on May 4, under the ring name Trinity.

Additionally, there is evidence that the study of female diseases was not their only interest, but they studied, taught, and practiced all branches of medicine, indeed multiple references attest to the vital role they played in surgical and scientific achievements.date=May 2022  \nIt has been possible for them to assert themselves within Salerno thanks to a climate of great tolerance that extended itself from women practitioners as well as Jews and Arabs. In addition, during most of its lifetime, Salerno was the only medical school in Europe that opened its doors to women  \n## Women in medieval southern Italy and Salerno  \n<image>Miniature depicting the Schola Medica Salernitana\nIn medieval southern Italy, Salerno was, in the 11th century, a \"city of extraordinary wealth and splendor for its trade, in which it had supplanted Amalfi and Gaeta. There were cedars, almonds, coated walnuts, imperial drapes, fine gold ornaments; wine, nuts, fruit, trees and crops abounded. Beautiful palaces adorned it; attractive women and upright men lived there\" ( Guglielmo di Puglia, 1090). In this political, social and cultural background, the women shared the deeds of men, participated in battles and exercised the medical art, as doctor or not. Intellectual openness excluded dogmas and confronted with the daily practice of dialogue and experience, with the comparison of Greek, Latin, Arab texts that were studied without prejudices or hierarchies of value. In this climate, accepting women as students and even more as teachers seemed natural and important. Indeed, the remedies used by women are appreciated and welcomed in the writings of the Schola Medica Salernitana. Matteo Plateario (1140-1180) mentioned the women of Salerno and their remedies in his Liber De Semplici Medicina.\n\n## Studies and methodologies  \nThe women of Salerno were free to talk about sexual topics without moralisms or religious conditioning. In addition, their writings were some of the first to talk about menstruation.  \nDuring the early years of 1000s, people were already talking about fundamental modern values, such as prevention and healthy eating, as a base for medical treatments. The Mulieres Salernitanae preferred treatments like aromatized baths, therapies with herbs and massages, and there are no traces in their history of prayers or other supernatural methods in order to treat diseases.  \nGenerally, Trota's and the other women's writings were the first studies on the female body in medicine.  \nFundamental for them was the history of the patient, in order to identify the right therapy. Reading their works shows that they were not only deeply acquainted with the female body, but also had a high knowledge of plants and the benefits of herbs. They were innovative in many respects, considered prevention fundamental, proposed unusual methods for the time, stressed the importance of hygiene, a balanced diet, physical activity, their advices included baths and massages, decoctions, bloodletting. They had no fear of revealing truths never told and to solve problems never solved, their lessons were taught with extreme naturalness of sexuality, contraception using a simple language accessible to all. Their students were able to differentiate between typhoid and malaria, they could calculate fever temperatures and estimate recovery times, and they could treat complex wounds with appreciable chances of success.  \n## Allegations of witchcraft  \nThere were also many rumours about the mulieres salernitanae: as an example, Arnaldo da Villanova, a Spanish scientist, explained that women of Salerno drank mysterious potions during gestation and for this reason women grew aberrant, accompanying the recitation of the Pater noster with a mysterious magic formula:  \nThese rumors were born due to the fact that, despite the wealth and intellectual openness of the city of Salerno, the early medieval era also represented the start of prejudice towards women and the theory of feminine inferiority. Jules Michelet (1862) stated that “the only doctor of the people, for a thousand years, was the Witch”.  \nDespite these rumors of discredit, however, their fame grew, not only in Italy but also beyond the Alps.  \n## Notable women of Salerno  \nThese women included:  \n* Trota of Salerno – The most famous of the women of Salerno, Trota is believed to have lived during the 11th or 12th century. She had long been believed to be \"Trotula of Salerno\", the author of a 3-part book about medical treatments for women, De curis mulierum (\"On Treatments for Women\"). However, recent discoveries indicate she was likely only the author of one third of this compendium.  \n* Constance Calenda (15th century) – Lectured on medicine and was eventually a professor at the University of Naples.  \n* Rebecca Guarna – Published works on \"Fevers, De febrius\" the \"Urine, De Urinis\" and the \"Embryo, De embrione\".  \n* Abella – Published works on \"Black Bile\" and \"Nature of Seminal Fluid\"  \n* Maria Incarnata  \n* Mercuriade – Published works on \"Crises\", \"Pestilent Fever, De Febre Pestilenti\", and \"The Cure of Wounds, De Curatio\"  \nThe first to remember the women of Salerno is a historian from Salerno, Antonio Mazza, prior of the School of Medicine in the seventeenth century, who in the essay \"Historiarum epitome de rebus salernitanis\" writes \"We have many learned women, who in many fields surpassed or equalled by ingenuity and doctrine many men and, like men, were remarkable in the field of medicine\". Among the most famous women who attended the school of Salerno was Francesca Cenci, wife of Matteo Romano Cenci, who received a degree in medicine and surgery from Carlo D’Angiò, Duke of Calabria, in 1321. Abella, from the noble family of Castellaneta, wrote “De atrabile” and “De nature seminis humani”, of which, unfortunately, any trace has been lost. Rebecca de Guarna specialized in the study and treatment of urinary diseases and fevers. Mercuriade, surgeon, wrote many didactic essays: “Le crisi”, “La febbre da pestilenza”, “La cura delle ferite”.  The most known of the women of Salerno is Trota, who was a Magistra of Medicine at the School of Salerno and ran a prolific clinical practice. She taught her students about three types of diseases: inherited, contagious, and self-generated, and this type of teaching was carried on by all the other women.  \n## Contributions  \nOne of the most important contributions of the women of Salerno is a textbook that was widely distributed throughout Europe. The textbook, “De Passionibus Mulierum ante in et post partum”, that witnesses the birth of obstetrics and gynecology as science, was first published around 1100 AD and then it was completely  revised by Ambrose Paré's assistants in the early 17th century. Also Paley, one of the greatest anatomist of his time, stated that many of his important anatomical and surgical considerations came directly or indirectly from the work of Salerno women. He advances that Salerno women first documents, thoughts and practices are an interesting and important part of our surgical heritage.  \nThe work begins by outlining the characteristic nature of the female gender, which, unlike the nature of the male, hot and dry, is rather cold and humid. So, lacking women the heat necessary to dissipate bad moods, their diseases were more frequent and mainly affect the reproductive organs. To defend themselves from moods women have a particular purification, the menstruation, whose regularity is a source and sign of health. The first task of the doctor is then to diagnose the reasons for the interruption of the regularity or scarcity of the menstruation and to identify with the pharmacopoeia the appropriate remedies.  \nPerineal tears and uterine tears are common wounds often experienced by midwives, giving Trotula and her students ample opportunity to develop new techniques and remedies for wound healing.  \nThe anatomy of the reproductive organs was known only through animal anatomy and written descriptions in Islamic texts. Salerno female physicians made an important contribution on this subject because female physicians had greater access to female patients than their male colleagues. They deepened the study of the female body, coming to theorize that infertility could also depend on men and not only women.  \n## Bibliography  \n* * Alaina Ferraris BA, Zoe, Ferraris, Victor A.

The episode was written by Chris McKenna and directed by Jeff Melman. It originally aired on October 13, 2011 on NBC. It follows a community college study group at a housewarming party for members Troy (Donald Glover) and Abed (Danny Pudi). When Jeff (Joel McHale) throws a die to determine who will go to collect the pizza delivery from downstairs, seven different timelines unfold, showing each member of the group leaving to collect it depending on the outcome of the die—including the canonical timeline, in which Abed catches it before it lands. The episode was intended to be the third episode of the season, but was delayed by a week due to filming, editing and visual effects overrunning. As a result, \"Competitive Ecology\", due to be fourth, was aired third.  \n\"Remedial Chaos Theory\" is a concept episode, with each timeline showing how the group is affected by the absence of one of its members. \"The Darkest Timeline\" ensues when Troy leaves, causing Pierce to be shot and a fire to break out. Further episodes continued plot points from this timeline. The episode received critical acclaim, lauded by fans and critics alike as one of the best episodes of the show. It has been described as one of the best episodes of 2011 and the 2010s. McKenna received a PAAFTJ Award and an Emmy Award nomination for his work on the episode. \"Remedial Chaos Theory\" also received a Hugo Award nomination.  \n## Plot  \n<image>Yahtzee, the dice game that the group begin to play.\nTroy and Abed invite their study group to a housewarming party. After Abed presents his Raiders of the Lost Ark boulder diorama, the group begin playing Yahtzee. Jeff rolls a die to determine which of the group must collect the pizza delivery, numbering starting from his left. Abed claims that Jeff is creating six different \"timelines\" by rolling the die.  \nJeff rolls so that Annie (Alison Brie) gets the pizza. As Pierce (Chevy Chase) claims he had sex with Eartha Kitt, Britta (Gillian Jacobs) is stopped from singing along to \"Roxanne\" (1978) by Jeff. Troy finds a gun in Annie's bag. Pierce tries to give Troy a present. Jeff hurts his head on the ceiling fan. Annie returns, calling the pizza guy a creep. Similar scenes subsequently arise when the scene is restarted, Jeff rolling a different number each time. It arises that the group thinks Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) has a baking problem and Pierce's gift is a Norwegian troll that scares Troy. Other recurring scenes include Abed catching the rolling diorama boulder, Britta smoking marijuana, and Annie inspecting Jeff's head injury.  \nWhen Shirley gets the pizza, the group let her pies burn, so she insults them and exits. When Pierce leaves, Troy unloads to Britta about Jeff making him feel immature. When Britta leaves, Pierce torments Troy with the troll; Britta returns engaged to the pizza guy. \"The Darkest Timeline\" arises when Troy leaves. Annie trips over the diorama boulder, flipping a table. Her gun discharges and shoots Pierce in the leg. Britta drops a joint, starting a fire. Troy returns to find the troll staring at him amid the chaos. When Abed leaves, Shirley learns Britta smoked marijuana, Troy becomes furious at Pierce, and Jeff and Annie kiss, then fight; everyone but Abed is unhappy. In a seventh timeline, Abed catches the die and exposes Jeff's plan: there are seven people and the die is six-sided, so Jeff never has to collect the pizza. The group make him do so and dance to \"Roxanne\". Abed suggests that Annie move into the apartment.  \nThe end tag shows the Darkest Timeline: Shirley is an alcoholic; Pierce died; Annie was sent to a mental health ward; Jeff lost an arm in the fire; Troy lost his larynx trying to eat the troll; Britta put a blue streak in her hair. Abed makes felt goatees for the remaining group members, suggesting that they become evil and try to journey to the main timeline.\n\n## Production  \nThis episode was Chris McKenna's sixth writing credit for Community.  \n\"Remedial Chaos Theory\" was broadcast as the fourth episode of the third season. The episode premiered on NBC on October 13, 2011, a Thursday 8p.m. timeslot. It was written by Chris McKenna, his sixth writing credit of the series. The writers used annotated diagrams, or \"story circles\", one for each character per timeline, displaying the character's actions in that timeline; series creator Dan Harmon later published images of them on Tumblr. The episode was directed by Jeff Melman.  \nThe episode was originally intended to air as the third episode, but was delayed a week because the episode still needed to be completed, including editing, reshoots, and visual effects. Series creator Dan Harmon wrote that this was his decision, which broadcaster NBC agreed to. A number of jokes from this episode are cited in the episode \"Competitive Ecology\", which was the actual third episode to air due to the re-ordering. In \"Competitive Ecology\", Pierce mentions his Eartha Kitt story and Shirley references Britta's marijuana usage. A consequence of the re-ordering was that two consecutive episodes, \"Geography of Global Conflict\" and \"Competitive Ecology\", had similar B-plots involving Chang (Ken Jeong) and his security guard storyline. Additionally, the re-ordering meant that the episode following this, \"Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps\", became the second episode in a row to feature seven different stories. The opening lines of \"Remedial Chaos Theory\", in which Britta and Annie dispute whether the apartment number is 303 or 304, is a reference to the re-ordering.  \nPrior to Harmon announcing that the episodes had been reordered, some fans and critics noticed inconsistencies between \"Competitive Ecology\" and \"Remedial Chaos Theory\", speculating that the final timeline shown in this episode was not the one that would be followed in future episodes. Harmon commented that the canonical timeline which other episodes continue on from is the final one shown, where Abed prevents the die from landing on a number, saying that no ambiguity was intended.  \nThe song \"Roxanne\" by The Police plays briefly in several timelines and for a lengthier period in the final one. According to Harmon on audio commentary, licensing of this song used up much of the music budget for the whole third season, leading to the frequent use of \"Daybreak\" by Michael Haggins and Ludwig Göransson's score for the series in the season's other episodes. However, McHale later said that Harmon often purchased music if the studio refused to, and gave \"Roxanne\" as an example.  \n## Themes  \n\"Remedial Chaos Theory\" is a concept episode. Some critics commented that there was an absence of an overarching plot. Storylines play out across timelines, such as Pierce being jealous that Troy moves out of his mansion to live with Abed. Other details like Troy and Abed putting a bowl of olives by their toilet occur repeatedly.  \n<image>When Troy, played by Donald Glover, leaves to get the pizza, a series of disasters ensues; this is referred to as \"The Darkest Timeline\".\nCritics found that each timeline shows how the absence of any member of the group would significantly disrupt or affect the others, variously interpreting each timeline. The \"Darkest Timeline\" arises when Troy leaves the group to get the pizza. Critics have commented that this indicates that Troy is the group's linchpin, without whom the group descends into chaos, or that Troy should be the leader of the group rather than Jeff. Some critics found that Annie has a caretaker role, despite struggling to take care of herself, whilst Shirley is a mother figure as the other characters do not take responsibility for their actions. Joshua Kurp of Vulture opined that without Pierce, Jeff feels insecure about being the oldest. Others found that Troy tries to act mature around Britta, and wants Jeff to view him as an adult, but is immature when just with Abed. In regards to Abed, it was suggested that his meta-commentary on the group allows them to confront their issues. Though Jeff's consistent interruption of Britta as she tries to sing \"Roxanne\" initially seems like a joke on her, it is a joke at the expense of Jeff, as the rest of the group happily join in when he is the one to get the pizza. According to some critics, the group would be better off without Jeff.  \nCommentary was made on the episode's allusions to other media, and its usage of props. Similar to the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day, in which a character is repeatedly woken up to the same song to indicate the same day occurring over and over again, \"Remedial Chaos Theory\" uses a song—\"Roxanne\" by The Police—to mark the start of a new timeline. The Darkest Timeline was compared to the Star Trek episode \"Mirror, Mirror\", in which characters battle evil versions of themselves. Annie's gun is a Smith & Wesson, which David Mello of Screen Rant reported would not discharge in the way depicted in the Darkest Timeline. Pierce's Serbian rum has a Cyrillic label reading \"generic rum\". Some of Abed's bedroom decorations, such as a Kickpuncher poster, were previously shown in his season one college accommodation.  \nLater episodes drew on plot points from \"Remedial Chaos Theory\", such as the Darkest Timeline, which the episode also popularized as a pop culture phrase. Evil Abed reappears briefly in the season three episodes \"Contemporary Impressionists\" and the finale \"Introduction to Finality\". In the former, Abed briefly hallucinates Evil Abed, and in the latter he begins to act as Evil Abed when it looks like he will lose Troy as a friend. The fourth season finale, \"Advanced Introduction to Finality\", has a storyline built around the evil characters from the Darkest Timeline invading the canonical timeline. In the end tag of that episode, Evil Troy and Evil Abed host \"Troy and Abed in the Morning\" with Chang and visit the \"5\" timeline.\n\n## Reception  \n### Ratings  \nIn its original broadcast on October 13, 2011, the episode was viewed by an estimated 3.82 million people, up 13 percent from the previous week. It had a Nielsen rating of 1.7 in the 18–49 demographic. After factoring in seven-day DVR viewership, the episode received a 2.4 rating in the 18–49 demographic.  \n### Critical reviews  \nWhilst critical reception to the first three episodes of the season were generally lukewarm, \"Remedial Chaos Theory\" received critical acclaim, and remains a favorite episode amongst both fans and critics. Reviews at the time include an A rating in The A.V. Club, a rating of ten out of ten in IGN and a rating of 4.5 out of five stars in TV Fanatic. Adam Quigley of /Film found it the best episode of the program up to that point. Critics praised the episode's structure and the show's return to a high-concept episode. Kelsea Stahler of Hollywood.com praised that after the first three episodes of the season, the show revisited \"experimental, high-concept television laced with absurd comedy\".  \nAspects of the episode highlighted for praise included the attention to detail and intricacy in the alternate timelines. Emily St. James of The A.V. Club praised the episode as simultaneously \"silly, moving and revelatory\". The episode's end tag and Darkest Timeline scene were received positively. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly found that the episode was well-acted by each cast member. Alan Sepinwall of Hitfix praised the episode for its detailed depiction of the relationship between each of the characters in the group. Sepinwall further praised the episode's humor. Robert Canning of IGN found that the episode \"told a great story, it satirized a specific aspect of pop culture and it, above all else, was full of laughs.\"  \nLater reviews of the episode were also positive. The episode ranks highly in lists of the best Community episodes. In Cory Barker's ranking for TV.com of all 110 episodes of the series, \"Remedial Chaos Theory\" was listed first overall, with the description \"smart, narratively inventive, constantly funny, and somehow still couched in character relationships\". The episode also appears in some critics' lists of the best television episodes of the year or decade. James Poniewozik of Time included it in a list of the ten best television episodes of 2011. Adam Chitwood found that the episode stood out amongst the Community episodes of the year, ranking the show fourth on his list of best television programs of 2011. Ranking it as the tenth-best television episode of the 2010s, Sadaf Ahsan of the National Post praised it as \"effortlessly funny\". Melanie McFarland of Salon, ranking it as the best episode of 2011, lauded it for \"extraordinarily merging scientific theory, sci-fi, and reality\". Gwynne Watkins of Parade reviewed the episode as \"fast-moving and laugh-out-loud funny\" in a list of the top 20 television episodes of the 2010s. The Ringer listed it as one of the 100 best television episodes since 2000, calling it the moment when the show shifted from a \"quirky middle-of-the-lineup sitcom\" to \"experimental art\".  \n### Awards and nominations  \nIn 2012, the episode received two nominations and one award.\n\nQuestion: In the context of the provided images and their descriptions, which event is referred to as \"The Darkest Timeline\"?\nChoice list: \nA.

Born to a noble ethnic-Javanese family, Sartono studied law at Leiden University. During his studies, he joined the Perhimpoenan Indonesia association and became an advocate for Indonesian independence. After graduating, he opened a law practice and helped found the Indonesian National Party (PNI) in 1927. When several party leaders were arrested by the colonial government in 1929, he became one of their defense lawyers and unsuccessfully argued for their acquittal. Following the arrest of its leaders, PNI became paralyzed and the party subsequently suspended its activities. In its place, Sartono founded a new political party, Partindo, which sought to achieve independence through non-cooperation and mass action. Partindo lasted until 1936, when it decided to dissolve itself. After Partindo's dissolution, Sartono helped found another party, Gerindo, which advocated for the creation of an Indonesian parliament.  \nFollowing the Japanese invasion of the colony in 1942, Sartono briefly left politics, before returning to serve as the general-secretary of a Japan-founded labor organization, Putera, in 1943. He subsequently served in several positions during the Japanese occupation period, including as a member of the Central Advisory Council and Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence. After the proclamation of Indonesian independence in 1945, he was appointed one of five ministers of state in the Presidential Cabinet by Sukarno. As minister, Sartono was dispatched to the Yogyakarta Sultanate and Surakarta Sunanate to shore up support for the nationalist government. During the subsequent national revolution, he became a member of the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP), the provisional legislature, and served in the KNIP's working body, which ran the legislature's day-to-day affairs. He then served as an advisor to the Indonesian delegation of the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference before being elected speaker of the DPR of the United States of Indonesia in February 1950.  \nSartono served as speaker of the DPR throughout the entirety of the liberal democracy period, being re-elected in August 1950, when the Provisional DPR was formed following the transition into a unitary state, and again in 1956, after legislative elections were held. Following the fall of Mohammad Natsir's Cabinet in 1951, Sartono was appointed formateur by Sukarno. His efforts were thwarted due to policy differences between the two largest parties, the PNI and Masyumi Party, and he returned his mandate after less than a month. Following Mohammad Hatta's resignation from the vice presidency in 1956, Sartono was legally second in the presidential line of succession and he conducted presidential duties on multiple occasions. In 1960, the DPR was suspended by Sukarno as it rejected the government’s budget. Sartono was deeply embittered by the DPR's suspension, and he subsequently resigned from the DPR and did not take public office for several years. In 1962, Sartono accepted an offer by Sukarno to serve as the deputy chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council (DPA). His time in the body \"confused and irritated him,\" p = 191 and he eventually resigned from the DPA in 1968. He died in Jakarta, on 15 October 1968, and was buried at Astana Bibis Luhur, Surakarta.  \n## Early life and career  \nSartono (on the far right), as a student in the Netherlands  \nSartono was born in Wonogiri, near what is today Surakarta, on 5 August 1900. p = 83 Born to a noble ethnic-Javanese family, he was the second oldest of seven children. His father, Raden Mas Martodikarjo, was a civil servant who was a descendant of Prince Mangkunegara II. His mother was a noblewomen, who was a descendant of Prince Mangkunegara III. p = 4 In 1906, he left Wonogiri and began his education at the Europeesche Lagere School in Surakarta, a school only for children of noble descent. There, he graduated in 1913, with the highest grade. After graduating, he was accepted to the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (MULO) school also in Surakarta. pp = 5 – 7 Sartono spent three years in MULO, from 1913 until 1916, and after graduating, he left for Batavia. p = 10 In Batavia, he entered the School tot Opleiding voor Inlandsche Rechtskundigen, later known as the Rechts School, a law institute for the native Indonesian nobility. p = 11  \nAt Rechts School, he joined the Tri Koro Dharmo organization, a youth organization of Budi Utomo, which later evolved into Jong Java. p = 19 In 1921, he passed in his law examination, and received the title of \"rechtskundige\" (jurist). After graduating, he became a civil servant at the District Court in Surakarta for around six months. p = 20 In September 1922, Sartono left his job as a civil servant, and departed to the Netherlands, to study for a doctorate in law at Leiden University, along with his former classmate Iwa Koesoemasoemantri. The pair departed from Surakarta to the port of Tanjung Priok, the main hub for transportation from the colony to Europe. p = 23 They arrived in Genoa, Italy, before taking the train to the Netherlands. p = 24 During his studies in Leiden, he joined the Perhimpoenan Indonesia association, and became the associations secretary from 1922 until 1925. p = 438  \n## Early political career  \nAfter completing his studies, Sartono returned to the Indies in 1925, and opened a law practice in the city of Bandung, p = 83 together with his friends from Leiden (including Iskaq Tjokrohadisurjo, Budiarto Martoatmodjo, and Soenario). The young advocates were successful in handling the legal actions of Dutch authorities. p = 38 One notable case they handled was the trial of a man named Jasin, who was a train conductor from Tasikmalaya. Jasin was accused of being part of the failed 1926 communist revolt. As a result of Sartono's defense, Jasin's punishment was lightened, but he was still found guilty, and exiled to the Boven-Digoel concentration camp, in West New Guinea. p = 39 Sartono later participated in the founding of the Indonesian National Party (PNI) at Bandung on 4 July 1927. p = 122 Following the 1929 PNI congress in Yogyakarta, he was appointed as treasurer of the party. p = 55 He also became the legal adviser during the second Indonesian youth congress in 1928 – which resulted in the Youth Pledge. p = 59  \nPortrait of Sartono, date unknown  \nIn 1930, the Dutch colonial government arrested four of the PNI's leaders, and later sentenced them to prison time. pp = 68–73 Sartono was not arrested, and instead he became one of Sukarno's defense lawyers during Sukarno's trials in Bandung. In 1931, Sartono founded the Partindo party, after the disbanding of the PNI. During his leadership of Partindo, he created a department for labor unions, which Sartono directly managed. Despite this, Sartono argued that labor unions should not engage in politics. p = 179 Sartono led Partindo until 1933, when the released Sukarno was elected the party chief and Sartono became his deputy. p = 84 Around the same period, the Swadeshi movement in Colonial India began capturing the attention of the many politically active Indonesians. pp = 185 – 186 This included Sartono, who became an advocate for the movement, and also chaired a commission on the movement within Partindo. p = 187  \nAfter Sukarno's election as leader, however, Sukarno's view that labor unions should be associated with political parties became dominant – and in 1933, the party's official position became that labor unions must be based on political parties. pp = 223 – 224 Partindo was again disbanded in 1937, and Sartono further took part in the founding of another party, Gerindo, where he was deputy chief under Amir Syarifuddin. p = 438 Following the successful Japanese invasion of Indonesia, Sartono briefly left politics and handled rubber plantations in the Bogor region. p = 102 He was also head of the organizational section of the Japan-founded labor organization Putera and a member of the Javanese Central Advisory Council, also set up the occupation government. In 1945, he was appointed as a member of the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence. p = 102 For some time, he was also the adviser to the Japanese Department of Internal Affairs between December 1944 until June 1945. p = 438  \n## National revolution  \n<image>The Jakarta Art Building (pictured in 2018), where the Central Indonesian National Committee first convened in\nShortly after the proclamation of Indonesian independence, Sartono was appointed as one of five ministers of state (alongside Oto Iskandar di Nata, Mohammad Amir, Wahid Hasyim, and A.A. Maramis). p = 107 Sartono and Maramis were dispatched to Central Java's traditional monarchies (the Surakarta Sunanate and Yogyakarta Sultanate) to give assurances that the monarchies would remain in exchange for support of the new nationalist government. p = 115 On 19 August 1945, he took part in a meeting which resulted in the agreement to form the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP). p = 6 Sartono also rejoined the reformed Sukarno-led PNI. p = 93 The party had significant internal issues due to personal and ideological differences of its members, with Mohammad Hatta remarking in an interview with Irish historian Benedict Anderson that Sartono and Abikusno Tjokrosujoso had internal conflicts almost immediately after its founding. p = 98  \nIn December 1945, he became chief of the political department of a further restructured PNI. pp = 227–228 Sartono was a member of the KNIP and was part of its leadership until October 1945, when the leadership was replaced by a new group of younger members. pp = 174–175 Later, he would return to the leadership positions, becoming deputy chair of the body's Working Committee (which ran day-to-day affairs) by January 1947. pp = 20–22 He lost the position in an election in April 1947, but was voted back in July 1949. p = 25  He left the body in 1949 as he joined the People's Representative Council of the United States of Indonesia (DPR-RIS). p = 24 He had been appointed as the head of a good offices mission to the State of East Indonesia in December 1948, but the mission was cancelled. p = 83 During the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference, Sartono also served as a general adviser for the Indonesian delegation. p = 108\n\n## Post-Independence career  \n### Early speakership: 1950–1956  \n<image>Official portrait as a member of the People's Representative Council, 1956\nFollowing the Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty, Sartono joined the DPR-RIS, and was elected as the body's speaker on 21 February 1950, after defeating Mohammad Yamin and Albert Mangaratua Tambunan in the leadership vote, taking office the following day. Six months later, on 16 August, the body was dissolved as the United States of Indonesia was transformed into a unitary state, and all its members became members of the newly formed Provisional People's Representative Council (DPRS). pp = 117 – 118 Sartono was again elected speaker of the body on its 19 August leadership vote. p = 140 Sartono was appointed as formateur for the government cabinet on 28 March 1951 following the fall of the Natsir Cabinet, and he attempted to form a coalition government between the PNI and the Masyumi. p = 148 However, his efforts were thwarted due to policy differences between the two parties - namely, on taxation, local government, and the West New Guinea dispute. pp = 177–178  \nThis was made worse by Sartono's unwillingness to become the prime minister or any cabinet minister. pp = 177–178 His failure led to him returning his mandate after less than a month on 18 April. The task was then assigned to Soekiman Wirjosandjojo and Sidik Djojosukarto – who managed to form the Sukiman Cabinet. pp = 179–180 During the Wilopo Cabinet period, Sartono called for the resignation of Hamengkubuwono IX as Defense Minister in the aftermath of the 17 October affair. Due to the government dysfunction caused by constant tensions between government and opposition parties in the parliament, Sartono went as far as to warn legislators in December 1953 that the parliament may be dissolved if tensions continued to increase. By 1955, the election saw highly divisive campaigning, and Sartono made a public statement asking political parties to \"not forget good manners\" when referring to one another. pp = 283-284\n\n### Later speakership: 1956–1960  \n<image>Official portrait as speaker, 1956\nIn 1956, there were proposals in the parliament to dissolve the Netherlands-Indonesian Union. A draft law was brought up during a 28 February 1956 meeting of the body, and following a vote it was accepted as agenda in the day's meeting. pp = 177 – 179 Sartono, who disagreed with the draft's inclusion, declared his resignation from speakership and walked out of the building, followed by his deputy Arudji Kartawinata and the PNI faction. On 1 March, members of the PNI, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party and the PKI, in addition to some members of the Nahdlatul Ulama submitted their resignations as members of the parliament. pp = 177–179 Still in March, Sartono secured a seat representing Central Java in the new People's Representative Council (DPR) as a result of the 1955 election. p = 83 Members of the body were sworn in on 20 March 1956, with the DPRS being dissolved, and Sartono was again elected as speaker. pp = 189 – 192  \nFollowing the resignation of Mohammad Hatta from his post as vice president (leaving it vacant until 1973), Sartono was legally second in the presidential line of succession, and he conducted presidential duties for three brief periods during his tenure - in December 1957, between 6 January and 21 February 1959, and between 21 April and 2 July 1959. p = 209 On 23 July 1959, following President Sukarno's 1959 Decree, and the return to the 1945 Constitution, Sartono was sworn again as the speaker of the further renewed DPR. p = 222 The DPR was eventually suspended by Sukarno on 24 June 1960 (though it met last on 5 March), ending Sartono's tenure as speaker. p = 239 After the DPR was suspended, Sartono did not take public office for several years. Allegedly, he refused all positions offered to him, though in one occasion he implied to Foreign Minister Subandrio that he would accept an ambassadorship for an African country – with the condition that Subandrio himself and Mohammad Yamin were both also assigned to similar positions.\n\n## Death and legacy  \nAfter several years of being unemployed, Sartono accepted an offer by Sukarno to serve in the Supreme Advisory Council (DPA), as the body's vice speaker in 1962. Throughout his time in the parliament – and during his time at DPA – Sartono pushed with little success laws meant to strengthen the government's financial accountability. American scholar Daniel Lev wrote that Sartono's experience in the body \"was a great disappointment to him\". He eventually resigned from the DPA and left politics entirely in 1967. He died in Jakarta on 15 October 1968, and was buried in Surakarta. According to author and historian, Nyak Wali Alfa Tirta, Sartono was a quiet, but well liked person, by both his opponents and friends. p = 112 The city government of Surakarta, along with the Mangkunegaran family foundation, have campaigned to make Sartono a National Hero of Indonesia.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Toyota GR Supra  \nThe Toyota GR Supra (model code J29/DB or A90/A91 for marketing purposes) is a sports car produced by Toyota since 2019. The fifth-generation Supra, the GR Supra was sold under and developed by Toyota Gazoo Racing (TGR) brand in collaboration with BMW. It is the successor of the A80 Supra, which ceased production in 2002.  \nThe GR Supra rides on a new jointly-developed sports car platform by Toyota and BMW, with a short wheelbase, wide track, and low centre of gravity, that also underpins the G29 BMW Z4. Initially, BMW considered using a pre-existing platform of their own to underpin the new Supra, to which chief engineer Tada-san declined. Both cars are manufactured at the Magna Steyr plant in Graz, Austria.  \nThe fifth-generation Supra uses BMW model code conventions, designated as a J29 series with DB model codes. However, Toyota used the \"A90\" and \"A91\" code for promotional and marketing materials for the fifth-generation Supra to maintain continuity from previous Supra generations.  \n## Development  \nMotor Trend had reported that a possible Supra successor could be based on the FT-HS (Future Toyota-Hybrid Sport), which debuted at the 2007 North American International Auto Show. The publication also reported that the fifth generation of the Supra could be powered by a 3.5-litre V-6 hybrid system generating over 0. Toyota quoted that it was not rushing for the Supra successor but instead was waiting to see how the sales and interests of the GT86/FR-S went.  \nIn 2010, Toyota applied for a trademark for the Supra name. The trademark had to be used within three years for it to be valid. In December 2011, Autoguide reported a possible Supra replacement that would sit above the GT86. Tetsuya Tada, the chief engineer of the Toyota 86/Scion FR-S told reporters in Germany in 2012 \"the president (Akio Toyoda) has asked me to make a successor to the Supra as soon as possible.\"  \nIn late 2013, AutoBlog reported a Supra successor concept would be making its debut the January 2014 North American International Auto Show. On 13 January, Toyota unveiled its new FT-1 concept car. Little is known about this new concept car; other than that it has a front engine and rear wheel drive layout. Toyota also stated that their new concept car draws inspiration from Toyota's past sports cars like the 2000GT, Supra, MR-2 and 2007 FT-HS concept car. Toyota did not state whether the FT-1 would use the Supra name, or if it was even bound for production. However, Toyota did state if the FT-1 is approved from production, a price tag of around 60,000 was to be expected for each unit. Upon the car's reveal, chief designer—Nobuo Nakamura—confirmed that the FT-1's design was used for inspiration for the Supra but the two cars differ in many ways. The production Supra was smaller and more of a pure sports car design, as opposed to the FT-1 being a larger grand tourer. According to Akio Toyoda, the new Supra's design and performance identity were inspired by the Toyota 2000GT. The interior design, layout, and parts (like the materials, seats, and steering wheel) were also done by Toyota, while only small interior switchgear come from BMW.  \nOn 10 February 2014, Toyota submitted an application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to renew the Supra trademark. In June 2016, a trademark application for the Supra nameplate was filed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office. According to Autocar, the new Supra was set to debut in 2018. The publication reported that the car would likely feature rear wheel drive; four-cylinder engines were expected to be available, and it had been confirmed that the car would offer a turbocharged inline-6 engine. It was believed that these engines would be supplied by BMW. Kleine Zeitung reported that the new jointly developed Supra will be produced at a Magna Steyr facility near Graz, Austria, alongside the BMW Z4 (G29). Although the sports car's name was yet to be officially confirmed, Toyota global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada said that it will likely carry the nameplate Supra, due to its historical significance to the nameplate. The name decision wasn't finalized, until very later in production.  \nOn 12 July 2018, a pre-production version of the Supra was unveiled with a camouflage at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. The car was confirmed to be a collaboration between Toyota and BMW with the new BMW Z4 (G29), but that the Supra is intended to be \"much more hardcore and track-focused\". Additionally, it was noted that the Supra was specifically engineered for an ideal 50–50 front-rear weight distribution. Tada also disclosed that the Supra was developed with benchmarking against the Porsche Cayman S (982), akin to the previous generation Supra's rivalry with the Porsche 968.  \n## Launch  \nThe fifth-generation Supra was unveiled at the January 2019 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The launch marked a 17-year hiatus since the previous generation was last sold. It was unveiled by Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda, who announced the Supra was tuned and developed with extensive testing at the Nürburgring, and how its performance and design lineage can be traced to the famed 2000GT. Two-time Formula 1 champion and Toyota Gazoo Racing driver Fernando Alonso was also present to help launch the Supra. The European launch was held at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show.  \nThe first production model was auctioned at a price of 2.1 million at a Barrett-Jackson auction to Craig Jackson (chairman and CEO of the Barrett-Jackson auction house) in January 2019, with 100% of the money going to the American Heart Association and the Bob Woodruff Foundation. The auction car has a one-off matte grey exterior colour which is not offered on the standard Supra, as well as a red interior, metallic black five-bolt wheels, red wing mirrors, a signature from Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda on the dashboard and VIN 20201.  \nThe Supra went on sale in Japan on 17 May 2019. In the United States, sales began on 22 July 2019 with a starting base price tag of 49,990. In Australia, sales began on 2 September 2019.  \n## Engineering and specifications  \n### Powertrains  \n<image>Inline-six BMW B58B30C engine in 3.0 models\n\n<image>Inline-four BMW B48B20 engine in 2.0 models\nThe Supra is powered by two BMW-sourced engine options: a turbocharged B48 2.0-litre inline-four or a turbocharged B58 3.0-litre inline-six. The 2.0-litre engine was initially offered in Japan, select Asian countries and Europe; the United States received the engine in 2020 for the 2021 model year. The 2.0-litre engine has a power output of 0 from 4,500 to 6,500 rpm or 5,000 to 6,500 rpm and abbr=on of torque from 1,450 to 4,200 rpm or 1,550 to 4,400 rpm, while the 3.0-litre engine has a power output of 0 from 5,000 to 6,500 rpm or 5,800 to 6,500 rpm and abbr=on from 1,600 to 4,500 rpm or 1,800 to 5,000 rpm. The 2.0 L model can accelerate from abbr=on in 5.2–6.5 seconds, while the 3.0 L model can accelerate from abbr=on in 3.9–4.1 seconds, 0.7–0.5 seconds quicker than the turbocharged variant of the A80 Supra and has an electronically limited top speed of abbr=on.\n\n### Drivetrains  \n6-speed manual transmission offered from 2023 onwardsPower is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF 8HP 8-speed automatic transmission that was fully re-calibrated by Toyota, who added also their software to the gearbox for the Supra. Toyota initially considered to give the new Supra a dual-clutch automatic transmission, but went with the ZF 8HP for its smoothness, reliability, and weight savings. A manual transmission was initially not offered, due to the torque-converter automatic having quicker shifts, its ability to handle a lot of torque with self-awareness on its aftermarket potential, and wanting to differentiate it from the 86.  \nA specialized ZF S6-53 (GS6L50TZ) 6-speed manual transmission option was made available in 2022 for the 2023 model year for the six-cylinder engine only. Like the automatic, the manual transmission was built from a combination of ZF parts and custom Toyota parts, but receives a rev-matching function and a shorter final drive ratio compared to the automatic.  \n### Performance  \nA test conducted by Car and Driver in December 2019 recorded the acceleration of the 3.0 L model from order=flip in 3.7 seconds (with 1-foot rollout), which is 0.3 seconds faster than the factory claimed. The order=flip time was also recorded in 12.2 seconds at order=flip. A test in August 2020 recorded the acceleration of the 2.0 L model from order=flip in 4.7 seconds and a order=flip time of 13.3 seconds at order=flip.  \nPower output testing by Car and Driver magazine in May 2019 and May 2020 showed that Toyota had significantly underrated the power output of both versions of the 3.0 L engine by at least 5–8 per cent. The 2020 US model year B58 3.0 L engine was rated at 0 and 0, yet in dynamometer testing by Car and Driver magazine, the 2020 model year Supra had a power output of 0 and 0 at the wheels. Similarly, the 2021 onwards model year engine was rated at 0 and 0, yet test results showed 0 and 0 at the wheels. The power at the engine's crankshaft is the standardized calculation manufacturers use to rate engine power, therefore since a dynamometer measures these power outputs at the wheels, these figures are also typically 5–8 per cent higher at the crankshaft on a modern performance car when accounting for driveline loss. Car and Driver's testing therefore revealed that the Supra was making, at the very least, 0 more power and 0 more torque at the crankshaft than the factory claimed for both versions of the 3.0 engine, so the later 3.0 model is likely producing over 0 and over 0.  \nGerman magazine Sport Auto set a lap time in August 2019 on the Nürburgring Nordschleife with a 2020 GR Supra on factory Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres of 7:52.17 minutes.  \n### Engineering  \nBefore production, Toyota wanted to develop and engineer a rear-wheel drive pure sports car that would compete against the Porsche Cayman S (982) and be a track and street weapon, all while avoiding supercar prices, while BMW wanted to build a roadster, which gave them the idea of co-developing an all-new platform that would handle both coupe and convertible variants with great rigidity and handling of torque. The platform takes few elements from BMW's M cars that were praised by both Toyota and BMW for their characteristics, such as the suspension design, forged control arms and electronic differential, all while being able to reduce costs for production and the final product. After co-developing the platform together, Toyota and BMW went to develop the rest of the two cars separately, such as chassis development, exterior and interior designs, and tuning of both drivetrain and suspension. For example, on the Supra, the side sills are significantly wider and stiffer, there is more chassis bracing, and Toyota initiated an engineering change to move the engine backwards in the engine bay for better weight distribution. The fake vents on the car's exterior were also leftovers from its race car prototype, and were designed for the aftermarket car community (who were responsible for the previous generation's cult following) to make them functional.  \n## Markets  \n### Japan  \nThe Supra is offered in three trim levels, which are the SZ, SZ-R and RZ. The SZ model is powered by the 0 2.0-litre engine and is equipped with 17-inch single tone wheels, manual seats, black fabric upholstery, dark silver trim and a 4-speaker sound system. The SZ-R model is powered by the 0 variation of the 2.0-litre engine and is equipped with 18-inch two tone wheels, eight-way powered seats, Alcantara/black leather upholstery, carbon fibre trim, 8.8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with 12-speaker JBL stereo sound system and a head-up display. The RZ model is powered by the 3.0-litre engine and is equipped with 19-inch two tone wheels. It also has the same interior equipments as the SZ-R model, with the difference being the use of Alcantara/red leather upholstery (black leather is available as an option) and sports pedals. A \"Sport\" mode and dual-zone climate control system, as well as the Toyota Supra Connect infotainment system is standard on all three trim levels. They are also equipped with Toyota Supra Safety suite, which features autonomous emergency braking, lane departure alert, blind spot monitor, adaptive cruise control and rear-cross traffic alert. GR Parts is also available, which includes the Toyota Gazoo Racing Recorder, which allows drivers to log their driving data to an SD card. This can be supplemented by using an optional dashcam, which synchronises the video with recorded information.  \n### United States  \nThe GR Supra was originally offered in the US in two variants, the 3.0 and 3.0 Premium. The 3.0 variant has a 6.5-inch centre touchscreen multimedia system with Bluetooth and standard Alcantara trimmed seats, while the 3.0 Premium has a larger touchscreen multimedia system (8.8-inches), standard navigation, wireless Apple CarPlay, 12-speaker JBL stereo sound system, wireless phone charging, colour head-up display and heated leather seats. All variants have collision warning, automatic high beams, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and a feature that recognizes road signs as standard.  \nIn 2020, for the 2021 model year, two new models, the A91 Edition and the 2.0, was introduced. For the 3.0, 3.0 Premium, and A91 Edition, the output of the 3-litre engine was increased to 0 and order=flip of torque. This increase in power is due to revised engine tuning, 10.2:1 compression ratio, and a six-port cylinder head and six-port turbo manifold, as opposed to the 11:1 compression ratio, two-port version for the 2020 model year. Additionally for the 2021 model year, the rear suspension bushings were updated and chassis stiffening bars were added to the engine bay. The 2.0 will feature the same 2-litre engine used in the SZ and SZ-R models sold in Japan, and is rated at 0 and order=flip of torque.  \nIn 2022, for the 2023 model year, the Supra 3.0 and 3.0 Premium became available with a 6-speed manual transmission.  \n#### Special Editions  \nAt launch in the US, Toyota announced they would release a special edition for each model year of the fifth-generation Supra's release cycle. To date, all special editions are based on the 3.0 Premium, and offer distinct details from standard models, while being produced in limited quantities.  \nIn 2019, for the 2020 model year, the first 1,500 cars produced for the US were released as special Launch Edition variants and are offered in three colours: Absolute Zero White, Nocturnal Black and Renaissance Red 2.0. Cars that have the white or black exterior colour have the same red interior as the auction car, which is only offered in the Launch Edition, while the red cars have a black interior. All Launch Edition cars have red coloured wing mirrors, all-black wheels, and an individually-numbered carbon fibre plaque with a replica of Akio Toyoda's signature fixed to the dashboard, mirroring the auction car.  \n2021 A91 Edition Supra in Refraction Blue  \nIn 2020, for the 2021 model year, a new A91 Edition was released, marking the updated platform featuring the new higher output 3-litre engine, and was limited to 1,000 units. The A91 naming implies a new model from the A90, due to the updated engine, but the chassis code remains the same. The A91 Edition is offered in two colours: an exclusive Refraction Blue and Nocturnal Black, both featuring exclusive matte black stripes on the C-pillars and a carbon fibre rear lip spoiler. It features an exclusive black leather and Alcantara interior with blue stitching and accents. It also includes matte black wheels, carbon fibre mirror caps, and a custom stitched key cover matching the interior.  \nThe A91-CF Edition was released in 2021,for the 2022 model year, limited to only 600 units. The A91-CF Edition is named \"CF\" for the special carbon fibre body kit consisting of a front splitter, side skirts, rear spats, and a rear duckbill spoiler. Additionally, matte black wheels, and a red and black leather/Alcantara interior with special stitching is included. It was released in Absolute Zero White, Nitro Yellow, and matte Phantom Gray paint colour options.  \nWith the launch of a new 6-speed manual transmission offering in the Supra in 2022 for the 2023 model year, a limited A91-MT Edition was released with a limited run of 500 units. In addition to the new manual transmission, it is offered in two exclusive colours, Matte White and CU Later Gray, and an exclusive Cognac tan leather interior. The A91-MT Edition also includes exclusive red badging, red GR engine bay strut brace, and Frozen Gunmetal Gray wheels.  \nIn 2023, for the 2024 model year, the 45th Anniversary Edition was released in North America with a limited run of 900 units, to mark the 45th anniversary of the launch of the first Supra, the 1978 Celica Supra. The model is offered in an exclusive Mikan Blast orange paint colour along with Absolute Zero white, and has an exclusive black side panel stripe graphic with a cutout Supra logo. It features a manually-adjustable rear spoiler which rises approximately abbr=in above the rear decklid, with an adjustment screw to change the angle of the spoiler for different effects on downforce per the driver's preference. The 45th Anniversary Edition also features matte-black 19-inch aluminium wheels and black painted brake callipers with a GR logo graphic. The orange colour and styling are stated by Toyota to be a tribute towards a custom Mk IV Supra of \"big-screen fame\", which is reputed to be the similarly orange Mk IV Supra featured in the 2001 film The Fast and the Furious.  \n### United Kingdom  \nThe Supra is sold in the United Kingdom in 3 variants, 2.0 Pro, 3.0, and 3.0 Pro. The 3.0 and 3.0 Pro are available in both automatic and manual versions from 2022 onwards.  \n### Australia  \nThe Supra is sold in Australia with two variants, including the GT and GTS.  \n### Mexico  \nThe Mexican market Supra went on sale in Mexico on 22 August 2019.  \n### South Africa  \nThe Supra is sold in South Africa in 3 variants, Track, Standard, and Matte Grey Edition variants.  \n### South Korea  \nOn 9 January 2020, Toyota Korea announced that the GR Supra was being released in South Korea on 21 January 2020.  \n### Malaysia  \nThe Malaysian market Supra was launched on 20 September 2019.  \n### Philippines  \nThe Philippine market Supra was launched on 9 July 2019.  \n### Taiwan  \nThe Taiwanese market Supra is offered in 2.0T, 2.0T Premium and 3.0T Premium trim levels.  \n### Indonesia  \nThe Indonesian market Supra was introduced at the 27th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in July 2019 and went on sale in October 2019.  \n### Thailand  \nThe Thai market Supra was introduced at the Bangkok International Motor Show in March 2019 and went on sale in November 2019.  \n## Recalls  \nOn 12 September 2019, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced a safety recall issued by BMW on the Supra for the seat belt guide loop mounts, which were welded improperly. Only seven units are affected by this recall notice. Of the seven, only one was in the hands of an owner.  \nOn 27 September, the NHTSA also announced safety recalls towards several BMW models for their faulty backup cameras. Owners were able to glitch the cameras into not working when backing up. A software patch fixed the issue. The Supra was listed in the recall, as well as direct BMW models such as the X3, X5, 3 Series, 7 Series, 8 Series and more. Even Rolls-Royce (which is owned by BMW) was included in the recall for their Phantom and Cullinan.  \n## Model codes  \nWhile Toyota used the \"A90\" and \"A91\" code for promotional and marketing materials for the fifth-generation Supra, a reference to the A40–A80 model and chassis codes used for previous generation Supras, the fifth-generation Supra uses BMW naming conventions. The fifth-generation Supra is a J29 series with DB model codes.  \n### Models  \n## Motorsport  \n### GR Supra Racing Concept  \nThe GR Supra Racing Concept is a concept racing car that previews the racing version of the fifth generation Supra. It debuted at the March 2018 Geneva Motor Show. The design was inspired from the 2014 FT-1 concept. It features a lowered suspension with Toyota OEM parts, BBS centre-lock racing wheels, Brembo racing calipers, a full roll cage and fire extinguisher system, a stripped out interior, Michelin track tyres and a centre exit racing exhaust. It also features carbon fibre for the bonnet, splitter, diffuser, mirror caps, side skirts, wing and bumpers. It is unknown what engine powered the concept.  \n### GR Supra GT4  \nThe GR Supra GT4 Concept is a concept racing car that was built as a racing study model for participating in the European GT4 racing series, as well as other GT4 class races around the world. It was first shown at the March 2019 Geneva Motor Show. Upgrades include reduced weight, upgraded brakes and suspension and the addition of a rear wing and roll cage.  \nToyota later unveiled a production model in October 2019, with an engine rated at order=out. It is primarily designed for customer racing, meaning it is able to be purchased and raced by teams that are not factory-backed. It has a seven-speed automatic, as opposed to the eight-speed unit on standard road going models, and an Akrapovič exhaust system. Inside, an FIA-standard racing seat is present featuring a six-point harness, along with a carbon fibre instrument cluster. A Magneti Marelli engine management system, motorsport ABS, data logger and fire extinguisher are standard, while an illuminated car number is optional. The GT4 is equipped with Brembo six-piston front and four-piston rear brake calipers and KW dampers. The GT4 is fitted with Pirelli P Zero racing tyres and OZ wheels. The roll cage and rear wing are also carried over from the concept. Sales began in Europe in March 2020, followed by North America in August 2020 and Japan/Southeast Asia in October 2020.  \nToyota released the updated GR Supra GT4 in October 2022, named the GR Supra GT4 EVO, with upgrades focused on engine performance, handling, and braking. The engine has been updated with increased power, an updated torque curve with maximum torque of up to 660 N⋅m (487 lb⋅ft), and improved cooling. Additionally, the brake system design has been improved, new ABS settings have been added, and the KW dampers and anti-roll bar specification have been updated for higher cornering speeds and improved handling. Owners of the previous GT4 will have the option to upgrade to the new GT4 EVO specification, if desired. The GT4 EVO will make its debut at the 2023 24 Hours of Daytona. Sales began October 2022 internationally, at a price of €186,000.  \nAs of 2022, more than 50 GR Supra GT4 cars have been used in GT4 class races. They have earned victories in 11 national and international GT4 championships, and over 100 podium finishes. In August 2022, the GR Supra GT4 earned its 50th class win in a major championship, at the GT World Challenge Asia at Sportsland Sugo in Japan.  \n### Super GT  \nToyota announced the use of the Toyota Supra in the Japanese Super GT racing series from 2020 onward for Toyota Gazoo Racing.  \nThe GR Supra GT500 is used for the top class in the championship racing series, the GT500 class, alongside the GR Supra GT300 in the GT300 class. It has been used from the 2020 racing series onward for Toyota Gazoo Racing, replacing the Lexus LC500 GT500 and Toyota 86 MC (GT300). The GR Supra GT500 features a order=flip 2.0-litre Toyota RI4A turbo four-cylinder engine, while the GR Supra GT300 features the 5.4-litre 2UR-GSE V8 engine according to JAF-GT GT300 regulations. As of 2022, the GR Supra GT300 has won 6 races, and the GR Supra GT500 has won 8 races in their first 3 seasons in the Super GT Championship.  \nIn the 2021 Super GT Series, the Toyota Supra GT500 raced by TGR Team au Tom's won the 2021 championship in the GT500 class, driven by Yuhi Sekiguchi and Sho Tsuboi. The team overcame a 16-point deficit in the final round of the season to win the championship.  \n### NASCAR  \nOn 5 July 2018, Toyota Gazoo Racing announced that the Supra will race in the 2019 NASCAR Xfinity Series. The new Supra made its NASCAR debut in February 2019.  \nOn February 23, Christopher Bell of Joe Gibbs Racing scored the Supra's first NASCAR win at Atlanta. The Supra has since won six out of the first 11 races of the 2019 season, including three from part-time driver Kyle Busch. At the end of the 2021 season, Daniel Hemric drove his Supra to his first win at Phoenix to claim the championship. In the 2022 NASCAR Xfinity Series, Ty Gibbs drove his Supra to 7 wins, claiming his first series championship.  \n### D1 Grand Prix  \nOn 13 March 2019, Toyota Gazoo Racing announced that it would be sponsoring the first fifth-generation GR Supra in the D1 Grand Prix production car drifting series, raced by Daigo Saito and Team Fat Five Racing (later rebranded as TMAR) for the 2019 season onwards. Team Toyo Tires also announced that they will be joining in using the GR Supra, driven by Masato Kawabata, from 2019 onwards. Other teams such as Team Yokohama Toyopet, Car Guy Racing, and SPAN Racing also later elected to use the GR Supra platform for their race teams.  \n### Formula Drift  \nIn March 2020, the first GR Supra for the Formula Drift drifting series was unveiled by Papadakis Racing in partnership with Toyota Gazoo Racing. It is powered by a modified B58 engine producing over 745 kW (1000 hp) and is driven by Fredric Aasbø. In November 2020, another GR Supra for Formula D was unveiled by GReddy Performance, powered by a modified B58 powerplant producing 596 kW (800 hp), and driven by Ken Gushi. Both Formula D GR Supras were featured by Toyota at the 2020 SEMA show, and have competed in Formula D since 2020. Team Huragan Racing's Oleksii Holovnia also began piloting a GR Supra in 2023.  \nAasbø went on to win the 2021 and 2022 Formula D Championship driving the GR Supra, winning five individual rounds since 2020. Strong performances by the GR Supra in Formula D have also helped Toyota win the overall Formula D Auto Cup in both 2021 and 2022.  \n## Awards  \n<image>The fifth-generation Supra won the Golden Steering Wheel award in 2019\n* Won the \"Golden Steering Wheel\" award by Auto Bild magazine in 2019 for Best New Sports Car.  \n* 2019 \"Car of the Year\" by Esquire magazine.  \n* Won \"Best Handling Car\" of 2020 by Sport Auto magazine, over such competition as the McLaren 600 LT, Porsche 718 Cayman GT4, and BMW M8 Competition.  \n* Won \"Best Sports Coupe\" in MotorWeek magazine's 2020 Drivers' Choice Awards.  \n* Selected to be on Car and Driver magazine's 10Best list for 2020.  \n* Automobile magazine's 2020 Automobile All-Stars winner.  \n* 2020 Automotive News PACE Award given to Magna for the weight-saving innovation of the composite space frame liftgate reinforcement on the 2020 Toyota Supra.  \n* Awarded Car and Driver magazine's \"Editor's Choice\" award for 2020 in the Sports Car category.  \n* Motor Trend magazine's 2020 \"Car of the Year\" finalist.  \n* 2020 North American Car of the Year finalist.  \n* On Car and Driver magazine's 10Best list for 2021, for a second consecutive year.  \n* The Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) awarded the fifth-generation Supra as the \"Sport Compact of the Year\" for 2021.  \n* Won \"Best Sports Coupe\" in MotorWeek magazine's 2021 Drivers' Choice Awards, for a second consecutive year.  \n* Awarded Car and Driver magazine's \"Editor's Choice\" award for 2021 in the Sports Car category.  \n* The Texas Auto Writer's Association named it the \"Performance Vehicle of Texas\" for 2021.  \n* 2021 \"Performance Coupe\" category award from the Texas Auto Writer's Association.  \n* Awarded Car and Driver magazine's \"Editor's Choice\" award for 2022 in the Sports Car category.  \n* On Forbes magazine's \"Best Sports Cars\" list for 2022.  \n* Won \"Best Japanese Sports Car\" for 2022 by HotCars.  \n* Won the 2023 ALG Residual Value Award by J.D.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Ramscappelle Road Military Cemetery  \nFounded in 1917, the Ramscappelle Road Military Cemetery is located two kilometers east of the city of Nieuwpoort in the province of West Flanders (West-Vlaanderen), Belgium. It is on the N367 (Brugse Steenweg), the road which leads from Nieuwpoort to the village of Sint-Joris, near the intersection with Ramscappelle Road (Ramskapellestraat).  \n## Design  \n<image>Stone of Remembrance\nRamscappelle Road Military Cemetery was designed by British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, one of three principal architects that had been appointed by the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) to design military cemeteries in France and Belgium, as well as memorials. Lutyens drew up the design for the cemetery on location. Later, a toolhouse, shelter, and south side wall were added to the design by assistant architect George Goldsmith. There is a War Stone, also known as a Stone of Remembrance, on the east side of the graveyard.  \nThis was designed by Lutyens for the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). It generally denotes a war cemetery with at least one thousand graves. Ramscappelle is an exception to this. The biblical phrase \"Their Name Liveth For Evermore\" on the War Stone was selected by author Rudyard Kipling. It is found on Stones of Remembrance around the world. Kipling, a member of the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), also chose the phrase \"Known unto God\" for the gravestones of the unidentified. The Cross of Sacrifice directly opposite the War Stone, on the west side of the graveyard, was designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield, also for the commission. It usually indicates a war cemetery with at least fifty burials.\n\n## Interments  \n<image>Cross of Sacrifice\n\n<image>East–west axis of cemetery between War Stone and Cross of Sacrifice\nRamscappelle Road Military Cemetery started with Plot 1 in the middle of the graveyard. Most of the interments in Plot 1 were made in July and August 1917. The burial ground was substantially enlarged after the Armistice of November 1918. At that time, the remains of the deceased from the battlefields and a number of smaller cemeteries were brought to Ramscappelle for interment. Those smaller burial grounds included:  \n* Boitshoucke Churchyard  \n* Ghistelles German Cemetery  \n* Middelkerke German Cemetery  \n* Nieuport Military Cemetery  \n* Nieuport-Bains Military Cemeteries  \nCurrently, there are 841 Commonwealth casualties of World War I who are either buried or commemorated in Ramscappelle Road Military Cemetery. Of those, 312 are unidentified. Included in that number are 26 special memorials to those initially interred at Nieuport or Nieuport-Bains, and whose graves were destroyed in battle. In addition to the above, 2 unidentified Foreign National burials are present, for a total of 843 graves in the cemetery. There are 529 identified casualties at Ramscappelle. Among those interred in the cemetery are World War I British flying aces Lieutenant Lionel Ashfield and Captain Harold Mellings.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true about the Ramscappelle Road Military Cemetery as depicted in the images?\nChoice list: \nA. The cemetery was designed by a single principal architect from the Imperial War Graves Commission.\nB. The Stone of Remembrance is typically found in war cemeteries with fewer than 100 graves.\nC. The phrase \"Their Name Liveth For Evermore\" on the War Stone was selected by Rudyard Kipling.\nD. The Cross of Sacrifice is only present in cemeteries with more than one thousand burials.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.",

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Tourism in the Basque Autonomous Community  \nTourism in the Basque Autonomous Community has increased considerably in recent years, and is a popular destination for tourists from Spain and France. According to data from the Eustat the number of tourists entering the region in the year 2009 was 1,991,790, with the final result still pending. 71% of the yearly visitors come from the rest of Spain; the greatest number from Madrid Autonomous Community (14.2%), and Catalonia (11.1%). International visitors make up the remaining 29% - the largest percent come from France (7.2%). 62% of the people who come to the Basque Autonomous Community visit one of the three capitals, 27% visit inland and 11% visit the coast. The average stay of the visitors is 2 days.  \n272 establishments possess the Q award, a certificate denoting quality in the Spanish tourism sector. In the Basque Autonomous Community 140 tourist establishments, including hotels, apartments and tourist offices, among others, have the Accessibility Seal from a program which advises tourist establishments how to improve their ability to serve customers with physical and intellectual difficulties and visual and hearing impairment.  \n## Tourist resources  \n### Cuisine and wine  \nThe Basque Country's cuisine is one of its best-known strengths, in fact the city of Donostia-San Sebastián has the second largest concentration of Michelin stars per square metre in the world. Wines from La Rioja Alavesa  are produced within the control framework of the Qualified Denomination of Origin of Rioja. Other wine-growing denominations of origin  are Chacoli, (from Biscay, Álava and Getaria), and Alvarinho, a semi-sparkling white wine.  \nThe Pintxos (tapas) are also served in some bars, also called cooking in miniature, giving rise in places to a Basque Nouvelle Cuisine.  \n### Bilbao  \n<image>Guggenheim Bilbao Museum\nBilbao is the region's most cosmopolitan and densely populated city which, since the nineties, has greatly altered its character and appearance, including some avant-garde architecture.  Titanium protects the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, and the entrances to the metro, covered by glass, were designed by Norman Foster. Other new urban developments are the Towers designed by the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, and the Bilbao Airport by Santiago Calatrava. Another of the city's attractions is the neoclassical Arriaga Theatre.  \nOld Town, or Siete Calles/Zazpikale (\"Seven Streets\"), starts by the Arriaga Theatre. Old Town contains Plaza Nueva (New Square), Santiago Cathedral and, at one end, the Ribera Market. Very close by is the Gran Vía, Bilbao's main shopping street. In recent years Bilbao has recovered both banks of the ria for leisure activities.  Loading docks have been replaced by avenues with works of architecture such as the Calatrava walkway. Among its notable events are Aste Nagusia, celebrated every year in mid-August, and the Santo Tomás Fair.\n\n### Donostia-San Sebastián  \nDonostia-San Sebastian is the capital of Gipuzkoa, located between Mounts Urgull and Igeldo, Santa Clara Island and La Concha Bay. It is currently a modern services city whose \"Ensanche\" (urban expansion) remains intact, with French-style streets and buildings which were erected at the end of the 19th century to accommodate the European bourgeoisie. In recent years the city has added attractions such as the Kursaal Centre, designed by Rafael Moneo and avant-garde works such as the Peine del Viento (Wind Comb), by the sculptor Eduardo Chillida. In October 2011 it was selected as the Spanish city with the best cuisine in Europe in the 1st edition of the Traveller's Choice ‘Food & Wine’ awards.  \nFrom the Bretxa Market, source of fresh seasonal produce,  one may enter the Parte Vieja/Parte Zaharra (Old Town), with narrow lanes which are home to some of the oldest buildings, such as San Vicente Church and San Telmo Museum, the old Dominican monastery. This area is the location of a large bulk of the pintxo (tapa) bars which have made cooking in miniature famous. The city has also gained some international fame for its culture, and was named as the European Capital of Culture for 2016. It is worth highlighting the International Film Festival (Nazioarteko Zinemaldia), in September, the Jazz Festival (Jazzaldia) and the Musical Fortnight (Musika Hamabostaldia), in summer, and the Horror and Fantasy Film Festival, in autumn.  \n### Vitoria-Gasteiz  \n<image>Vitoria-Gasteiz\nVitoria-Gasteiz is the capital of Álava, the political and administrative centre of the Autonomous Community and the headquarters of the Basque Government. It is renowned for its nature and its environmentalism, thanks to the a large number of pedestrian areas and one of the highest green space indexes per capita in the whole of Europe. On 22 October 2010, the European Commission chose the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz as the European Green Capital 2012. Its biggest urban jewel is its old town, originating from the Middle Ages, which is set on a hill and full of narrow streets with names which bring to mind past trades (Cutler, Blacksmith, Cobbler...). It is almond-shaped and contains small Renaissance palaces and Roman buildings, in addition to shops, pubs and other cultural spaces. This is the location of the church of San Miguel, home to the patron saint, the White Virgin, and Santa María Cathedral, whose restored works which are open to the public inspired the writer Ken Follett to write his novel World Without End in 2007.  \nBeyond the medieval town, the Ensanche (19th century expansion) is the main shopping area of the city, with large pedestrian areas and spaces such as the Plaza de la Virgen Blanca (White Virgin Square) or the Plaza de España, arcaded and Neoclassical. In addition to the urban gardens it is worth highlighting the Green Ring, with seven parks (Alegría, Armentia, Errekaleor, Olarizu, Salburua, Zabalgana and Zadorra), the result of a plan for the restoration and environmental recovery of the outskirts of the city.\n\n### Rioja Alavesa  \nMarqués de Riscal  \nTwenty centuries ago, the Romans arrived at Rioja Alavesa bringing with them vine plants and forever changing the destiny of the region. Located between the rocky Cantabrian Mountains and the River Ebro, Rioja Alavesa has one of Europe's most deeply rooted wine-producing traditions. You can find countless wineries in Rioja Alavesa. The restoration of many of their facilities has been entrusted to renowned architects, resulting in a curious combination of harvesting tradition and visual modernity. The main exponents of this architectural revolution are the Ysios winery, by Santiago Calatrava; the Marqués de Riscal winery, by Frank Gehry; the Viña Real winery, by Philippe Mazieres and the Baigorri winery, by Iñaki Aspiazu. The wine produced in Rioja Alavesa is complemented by many other wineries of all shapes and sizes, ranging from those managed as small businesses to those which are a family tradition. Most of them offer the opportunity to go on a guided tour, to discover their facilities and learn about wine production. Rioja Alavesa also has Megalithic sites and monuments. The land neighbouring the Cantabrian Mountains conceals one of the largest concentrations of dolmens in the Basque Country. Proof of this is the narrow spine which starts off near Meano, in the East, and which weaves its way up to Leza, several kilometres to the west. These are the monolithic monuments of El Sotillo, San Martín, Los Llanos and la Chabola de la Hechicera. At the other end, near to Labastida, there is an important wine presses site on which the coveted grape was tread. In Rioja Alavesa you can also visit several medieval villages. Laguardia is the entire region's figurehead, the starting point of what is known as the wine route, which brings together the historical and cultural legacy of the region and everything related to the world of wine. Other villages which are tourist attractions are Peñacerrada, Labraza, Labastida, Elvillar, Samaniego and Elciego.  \n### Nature  \n#### Natural areas  \nTxindoki Mountain  \nThe approximate 7,200 km² area of the Basque Autonomous Community is basically home to two types of landscape: a coastline which is green, humid and mountainous (which is the location of the regions of Biscay, Gipuzkoa and the Alavese Mountain), and the vast and dry southern plains of Álava. Between both of these extremes, the Alavese Plain acts as a transition zone. There are 19 natural areas of different categories, spread out across the entire Autonomous Community, and they can all be visited. Ten of them have the status of National Parks: Peñas de Aya National Park, Pagoeta and Aralar in Gipuzkoa; Izki, Valderejo and Entzia in Álava; Gorbea, and Urkiola in Álava and Biscay; Armañón in Biscay and Aizkorri in Gipuzkoa and Álava. Furthermore, there are six Protected Biotopes: Inurritza, Leizaran and the abrasion platform (Flysch) in Gipuzkoa; Itxina and Gaztelugatxe in Biscay; and the Laguardia Lagoons in Álava. In this rural setting there are some of the most important religious monuments such as La Antigua Roman hermitage, in Zumarraga, the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Arantzazu, the patron saint of Gipuzkoa, or the basilica of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. Many museums present traditional Basque culture, such as the Sagardoetxea (Cider Museum) or the Cider House in Astigarraga (Gipuzkoa), the ironworks of Agorregui (Gipuzkoa) and El Pobal (Biscay), the Elosu Museum of Basque Pottery (Álava)...  \n#### Active tourism  \nSurf in the Basque Autonomous Community.  \nThe Basque Country has a wide selection of active tourism companies and all types of adventure sport businesses, from the most technical and specialised to the more common forms such as surfing, mountain biking, hiking and bird watching. There are thirteen Long-Distance - or GR – footpaths, signposted and marked out with red and white marks, which make it possible to cross the Autonomous Community in all directions, discovering the frontiers of Gipuzkoa (GR 121), the Alavese Plain through the route along the side of the mountains (GR 25) or the Urdaibai biosphere reserve through GR 98. There are also Short-Distance - or PR – footpaths, signposted with white and yellow stripes, which allow you to complete shorter routes which are accessible to the general public, but with a similar theme. Cycling enthusiasts have 130 kilometres of Greenways which have been opened up, nine roads recovered from old railway lines which had fallen into disuse. Examples include the Plazaola Greenway, which crosses the valley of the River Leizaran, the old Basque-Navarre railway line, The Zadorra Greenway, between the Álava reservoirs, or the Arrazola Greenway, in the surrounding area of Mount Anboto.  \n### Basque coast  \n<image>Gaztelugatxe\nThe Basque coast comprises more than 250 kilometres of beaches, sandy areas, islands, rias, marshes, cliffs, fishing villages and rock formations (flysch) which are unique in the world. The Basque coast connects villages which have economies which are still strongly linked to the sea, such as Bermeo, Ondarroa and Getaria, with other towns which are traditionally tourist attractions such as Zarautz, Lekeitio and Mundaka. One of the symbols of the maritime Biscay is Gaztelugatxe, an island which is crowned by a hermitage and linked to land by a path with steps. Located on the coastline near to the estuary of the Ria of Urdaibai, a natural area which has been declared a biosphere reserve. In Gipuzkoa, it is worth highlighting Zarautz beach, one of the biggest and most popular among surfers, much like the beach of Mundaka in Biscay. Zumaia and its abrasion platform (Flysch), and the wetlands of Plaiaundi, in Hondarribia. In addition to this there are the recently created modern marinas such as Hondarribia, Orio and Getxo. To explore the culture and history associated with the sea, there are numerous models and objects in the Bilbao Maritime Museum, the Fisherman's Museum and the Naval Museum in Donostia-San Sebastián, among others. Furthermore, Donostia-San Sebastián Aquarium is famous for its eye-catching oceanarium through which a Perspex tube passes which is home to a wide range of species from the Cantabrian Sea. The Camino de Santiago (214.2 km) travels along the entire Basque coast and it is one of the oldest pilgrim routes. The route begins in the port of Hondarribia (Gipuzkoa), recalling the steps of the first pilgrims who arrived by sea.\n\n### Business tourism  \nBilbao Exhibition Center  \nDonostia-San Sebastián, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Bilbao have much experience in the area of conferences, meetings, conventions and incentives. All three have Convention Bureaux, which facilitate the organisation of events. The three capitals have opted for stylish sites, from which it is worth highlighting the Kursaal Congress Centre (San Sebastián), designed by Rafael Moneo, the Europa Congress Centre (Vitoria-Gasteiz) and the Euskalduna Conference Centre (Bilbao), which has the appearance of a ship which is continuously under construction. There are a further dozen sites on offer with different shapes and sizes for all types of gatherings, such as Ficoba, in Irun. Bilbao is also home to the Bilbao Exhibition Centre, a large, versatile space for every type of event.  \n### Events  \nVitoria-Gasteiz party  \nThe community's cultural agenda is extensive and diverse, bringing together top notch cultural and festive events involving all styles of music, theatre, dance, comics and cinema.  In Donostia-San Sebastián, the most famous event is the San Sebastian International Film Festival, which is held in September. Hundreds of films have been presented there, and it has been visited by movie stars such as Lauren Bacall, Alfred Hitchcock, Robert Mitchum and Woody Allen. The International Jazz Festival, which takes place in July, and the Quincena Musical, which is held in August, are the two other best known competitions in the capital of Gipuzkoa. It is also worth highlighting the Big Week of Donostia-San Sebastián in August, where you can watch the best fireworks around. In Bilbao, music takes on special importance in the summer, with rock festivals such as the BBK Live Festival or the Azkena Rock Festival, which attract the very best artists. It is also worth mentioning the traditional Opera season of the A.B.A.O. (Bilbao Association of Friends of Opera), the Biscay Choir Week and the concerts by the Symphonic Orchestra of Bilbao throughout the year. Film buffs gather in May in the Horror and Fantasy Film Festival and in November in the International Festival of Documentary and Short Films. There is also a special place for the famous Big Week of Bilbao which is always held in August, with countless activities and shows. In Vitoria-Gasteiz one of the most important cultural events is the International Theatre Festival which lasts from October to November, and the International Jazz Festival, where the best jazz musicians get together. Another notable event in the capital of Álava is the Festival of the White Virgin, which is held at the beginning of August and for which the entire city comes out to celebrate.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following images shows a location that was named the European Green Capital in 2012?\nChoice list: \nA.

Flag bearers carry the national flag of their country at the opening ceremony and closing ceremony of the Olympic Games.  Men and women from across the country and from a variety of sports have carried the flag at both the Summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games.  More than half of those representing the teams at the Summer Olympics are track or field athletes, though that sport does account for the most competitors at the Games.  \nJames Bickford, Norman Armitage, and Pat McDonald have all performed the duty twice.  Several athletes born in other countries have carried the flag, including those from Norway, Ireland, Sudan, Germany, and Czechoslovakia.  \n## Firsts  \nUS team manager Matthew Halpin was the first to carry the flag at the 1906 Intercalated Games, though that event is no longer considered by the International Olympic Committee to be part of Olympic history.  Ralph Rose became the first competitor to have the honor when he led the team out at the 1908 Summer Games, the first official Olympic Games to feature a parade of nations.  The first woman to represent the United States was fencer Janice Romary in 1968, her sixth consecutive Summer Olympics.  Native American Ojibwe Taffy Abel was the first person to represent the United States at the Winter Olympics when he was chosen to carry the flag at the inaugural Games in Chamonix in 1924. Rafer Johnson became the first African American to serve as the nation's flag bearer at the 1960 Summer Olympics. Janice Romary became the first woman to carry the flag at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Irish-born Pat McDonald, one of the \"Irish Whales\", became the first athlete to be selected as the flag bearer twice when he performed his second duty in 1924.  In 1956 two other athletes led the U.S. team out for a second time, James Bickford at the Winter Olympics and Norman Armitage at the Summer Games.  \n## Selection and reactions  \n<image>Lopez Lomong says he felt \"blessed\" to be selected as the 2008 flag bearer.\nThe flag bearers are chosen by a vote of the team captains of each sport.  \nAthletes view their selection of flag bearer as a great honor:\n\n## Flag dipping  \n<image>Ralph Rose competing at the 1908 Olympics after not dipping the flag in the opening ceremony\nOlympic protocol is that the flag bearer dips their flag to the head of state as part of the parade.  It has become tradition that the U.S. flag is not dipped, though the origins of this are surrounded by legend and are widely misreported:  \nThe parade of nations was introduced at the 1906 Intercalated Games with Matthew Halpin as the U.S. flag bearer.  Halpin gladly dipped the flag, noting that when he did so King George I of Greece \"staked me to a smile that made me feel like I belonged\".  The controversy began at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London where flag bearers were expected to dip the flag to Edward VII on two occasions.  Research by the International Society of Olympic Historians concluded that the flag bearer was Ralph Rose and that he might not have dipped the flag to the British King on one of those occasions in support of Irish struggle against British imperialism.  Martin Sheridan is often attributed with the explanation by stating at the time \"This flag dips to no earthly king\" but no evidence of this can be found.  Modern versions of the story describe how the Stars and Stripes have never been dipped during the parade of nations since 1908 but this is apocryphal.  It has been dipped on three occasions since then: 1912, 1924, and 1932.  \nThe 1932 winter games were held in Lake Placid and, though head of state President Herbert Hoover would normally have greeted the parade of nations, the duty was passed to New York governor Franklin Roosevelt.  This was the last time that the flag was dipped at the Olympics as political forces intervened thereafter.  The head of state awaiting the athletes at the 1936 Summer Games was Adolf Hitler, to whom the U.S. refused to lower their flag.  The 1940 Olympics were cancelled due to the onset of World War II and, in 1942, the United States Congress introduced the United States Flag Code which stated: \"That no disrespect should be given to the flag of the United States of America, the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing.\"  However, since the Flag Code is legally unenforceable, it appears to be merely codified tradition.\n\n## Foreign-born representatives  \n<image>Pat McDonald, the first athlete to carry the flag for the United States on two occasions and the first flag bearer born outside of the U.S.\nSeveral foreign-born athletes have represented the United States at the opening ceremonies.  Irishman Pat McDonald immigrated to the U.S. and was the first in 1920 and he, at the age of 42, became the oldest Olympic track & field champion.  Though he did not compete, he also went on to lead the U.S. team at the following Summer Olympics.  \nRolf Monsen, a multi-discipline Winter sports athlete born in Oslo, Norway, immigrated to the U.S. and competed as an American in 1928 and 1932.  He qualified for the 1936 Games and though an injury prevented him from taking part, he was still chosen to carry the flag.  \nThe American team at the 1936 Summer Games were led by Berlin-born, highly regarded gymnast Al Jochim who immigrated to the U.S.  \nOlga Fikotová was a discus-thrower at the 1956 Summer Olympics and the only athlete to win a gold medal for her home country Czechoslovakia in that year.  She began a much-publicised romance with American athlete Harold Connolly, much to the frustration of the Communist authorities.  Fikotová was accused of being a traitor and the Czechoslovak Olympic Committee banned her from representing her country again.  Now living in the U.S., she would go on to compete for her adopted country in the next four Summer Games.  Despite not being able to replicate her success, Fikotová was chosen to lead the American team at the 1972 Games in Munich, West Germany.  \nLopez Lomong carried the flag at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China and became the fifth flag bearer to be born outside the United States.  As a teenager in war-torn Sudan, Lomong was one of several thousand boys brought to America as a refugee in 2001.  His selection came during a time when the U.S. and other Western countries had been critical of the Chinese government's close links with Sudan, a country accused of human rights violations and war crimes.\n\n## Other notes  \nGodfrey Dewey, son of Melvil Dewey the inventor of Dewey Decimal Classification, was the president of the Lake Placid Organizing Committee and was largely responsible for the successful candidature of Lake Placid for the 1932 Winter Olympics.  In addition to his role as the U.S. ski team manager he was chosen as the flag bearer for the 1928 Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland.  \n## List of flag bearers  \nList of flag bearers:  \nKey\n\nQuestion: Which of the following athletes was the first to carry the flag for the United States on two occasions and was also the first flag bearer born outside of the U.S.?\nChoice list: \nA.

It involves the preparation and drinking of sencha green tea, especially the high grade gyokuro type.\n\n## History  \n<image>The tea hall at Manpuku-ji in Uji, Kyoto\nTowards the end of the 17th century in the Edo period, Chinese merchants visiting Nagasaki showed how brewed tea should be drunk, as practised in the Ming dynasty court. This practise of the Chinese tea culture spread in the 18th century until the beginning of the Meiji era, particularly among literati merchants, in the form of friends meeting in a less formal atmosphere than the chanoyu. Appreciation of painting and literacy objects then took on particular importance. These meetings, often followed by genuine meals, were the opportunity to admire the host's collections, most often composed of objects imported from China or made in Japan in Chinese style called karamono.  \nIn difference to the preparation of matcha tea, which is powdered, sencha is prepared using small leaf tea.  \nSimilarly to the Chinese Gongfu tea ceremony, senchadō has a codified form of preparation, presentation and enjoyment of tea.  \nIn spring 2020 the Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum in cooperation with Meiji-mura held a large sencha exhibition about Kimura Teizo, an outstanding art collector born in Nagoya. He was already collecting works by %E7%86%8A%E8%B0%B7%E5%AE%88%E4%B8%80 at the age of 25 and became patron of the arts. His collection of 3,307 items was donated to the Aichi Prefectural Museum of Art, including modern and contemporary art, Edo period paintings, tea pottery, Buddhist art and archaeological relics.\n\n## Utensils  \n<image>Basket for transporting Sencha tea utensils (Chakago or Teiran), made out of rattan, by Hayakawa Shōkosai I, ca. 1877–80s\n\n<image>Chinese-style charcoal basket (sairō-sumitori) for Sencha tea ceremony, made out of bamboo, 19th century\nSenchadō uses utensils which are necessary to perform tea.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# Watch the Throne Tour  \nThe Watch the Throne Tour was a co-headlining concert tour by American rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West that began on October 28, 2011 in Atlanta and continued until June 22, 2012 with its final show scheduled in Birmingham. Originally scheduled for 23 performances, the tour was expanded to 34 performances in North America due to heavy demand for tickets; 29 shows were confirmed in the United States with 5 shows in Canada. Following massive success in the United States and Canada, Jay-Z & Kanye West announced the European leg of the tour on February 21, 2012 which featured 23 performances, bringing the number of shows to 57 at the time.  \nFollowing the Glow in the Dark Tour, it marks West's first concert tour after four years, excluding his ultimately cancelled tour, Fame Kills with Lady Gaga. It follows Jay-Z's opening act for U2 at the U2 360° Tour and his The Home & Home Tour with Eminem. The concert, which has no opening act of its own, is in support of West and Jay-Z's 2011 album, Watch the Throne, with most of the album's track-list performed, such as singles \"Otis\", \"Lift Off\", \"Niggas in Paris\" and concert opener \"H•A•M\". Additional West singles like \"Gold Digger\", \"Stronger\", \"Heartless\" and \"All of the Lights\" and Jay-Z singles like \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", \"99 Problems\", \"Run This Town\", and \"Empire State of Mind\" are also performed.  \nThe critical and box office performance of the tour received rave reviews, with critics praising the production value, the elaborate stage design, and the large string of successful singles featured. The tour had very little promotion before its premiere, with the exception being behind-the-scene concert footage sponsored by Voyr. It grossed $48.3 million in North America in 2011 and $25.4 million in Europe in 2012.  \n## Synopsis  \nThe show begins with West and Jay-Z \"emerging on two cube-shaped mini stages to the operatic sounds of \"H•A•M\". Following that, \"Who Gon Stop Me\" is the next song, with \"Otis\" being performed with \"a Givenchy – designed American flag flashing on the stage's main screens\" after an extended introduction using \"Try a Little Tenderness\" by Otis Redding. Afterwards, Kanye leaves the stage, and Jay-Z performs songs like \"Where I'm From\" and \"Empire State of Mind\", encouraging the audience to sing along. Kanye returns to the stage afterwards, performing his own songs like \"Power\", \"Touch the Sky\", and \"Gold Digger\", eventually with the two of them performing songs together, like \"Run This Town\", \"Monster\" and the remix of \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\", where Jay-Z repeatedly told the crowd to \"put your diamonds up\", the sign for Roc Nation.  \nMixing hits from both artists discographies, like \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\", \"Good Life\", \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\" and \"99 Problems\", the show then segues into West performing \"Runaway\" and \"Heartless\", which has been described as \"emotional highlight of the show\". The most energetic part of the show has been reported to be during \"Niggas in Paris\", with \"the track's Will Ferrell intro (\"We're gonna skate to one song and one song only\") brought on the moment that everyone was waiting for.\" \"Niggas in Paris\" was originally performed three times in a row, but as the tour progressed, the song was regularly performed up to ten times in succession, with the record being 11 times in Paris, France. Following other Watch the Throne tracks like \"No Church in the Wild\" and \"Lift Off\", the show ends with \"Encore\" and an inspirational rendition of \"Made in America\", complete with images of Martin Luther King Jr. and \"sweet brother\" Malcolm X flashing on the big screen. USA Today described the stage design:  \nThis show was visually spectacular. There was a main, T-shaped stage where both entertainers performed together, and also two cube-shaped mini stages, one at each end of the arena, that rose and lowered at various points during the show. West and Jay-Z performed separately on these cubes, which showed various images (a snarling Rottweiler, a swimming shark) at different points of the show. Fireballs the size of car tires shot from the floor toward the ceiling during some performances. Two large video screens behind the main stage showed appropriate images during the performances; a virtually non-stop laser light show added to the oomph factor.  \n## Reception  \nWest and Jay-Z on in Greensboro, North Carolina.  \nCritical reception towards the tour was positive. MTV News gave the opening show a good review, writing \"While the WTT album has been noted for its opulent displays of wealth, Hov and Yeezy's show will be marked by the duo's overabundance of hit records.\" USA Today praised the duo's ability to get the audience excited, stating \"at one point, as Jay-Z and West performed Niggas in Paris from their new hit CD, \"Watch the Throne\", West exhorted the audience to \"Bounce! Bounce!\" The resulting stomping had Philips Arena rocking and shaking in a way that it hasn't for the Hawks in a long time.\" Rap-Up mused \"it was a crowning moment for Jay-Z and Kanye West as they kicked off the Watch the Throne tour to a packed house at Philips Arena in Atlanta on Friday night. The hip-hop kings, collectively known as The Throne, opened the most anticipated hip-hop tour of the year with a bang.\" Idolator stated that the tour featured \"an epic set list that featured selections from each artist's own behemoth catalog of hits as well as their Watch The Throne collaborations.\" The tour has grossed $48.3 million so far by the end of 2011, making it the highest grossing hip-hop tour and the eighth highest-grossing tour of 2011. In 2017,  Rolling Stone listed it in its list of \"The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years\". In 2019, Consequence of Sound named it the third best tour of the 2010s. The tour won best live stage show at the 2012 International Laser Display Association Awards  \nIn a 2011 interview with Rolling Stone, comedian Chris Rock said;  \n\"This might be the greatest show I ever saw. It's the equivalent of the Billy Joel-Elton John tour, but if they did it in 1979, when the songs were hot!\"  \n## Setlists  \n<image>Kanye West singles like \"Jesus Walks\", \"Gold Digger\", \"Stronger\", \"Good Life\", \"Heartless\", \"All of the Lights\", and  \"Runaway\" were performed during the tour.\n\n<image>Jay-Z singles like \"Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)\", \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\", \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", \"99 Problems\", \"Dirt off Your Shoulder\", \"Run This Town\", and \"Empire State of Mind\" were performed during the tour.\n\n\n### North America  \n- \"H•A•M\"  \n- \"Who Gon Stop Me\"  \n- \"Otis\"  \n- \"Welcome to the Jungle\"  \n- \"Gotta Have It\"  \n- \"Where I'm From\"  \n- \"Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)\"  \n- \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\"  \n- \"Jesus Walks\"  \n- \"All Falls Down\"  \n- \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\"  \n- \"Public Service Announcement\"  \n- \"U Don't Know\"  \n- \"Run This Town\"  \n- \"Monster\"  \n- \"Power\"  \n- \"Murder to Excellence\"  \n- \"New Day\"  \n- \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\"  \n- \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\"  \n- \"Good Life\"  \n- \"Empire State of Mind\"  \n- \"Runaway\"  \n- \"Heartless\"  \n- \"Stronger\"  \n- \"On to the Next One\"  \n- \"Dirt off Your Shoulder\"  \n- \"Touch the Sky\"  \n- \"All of the Lights\"  \n- \"Big Pimpin'\"  \n- \"Gold Digger\"  \n- \"99 Problems\"  \n- \"No Church in the Wild\"  \n- \"Lift Off\"  \n- \"Niggas in Paris\" (several times)  \nEncore  \n### Europe  \n- \"H•A•M\"  \n- \"Who Gon Stop Me\"  \n- \"Otis\"  \n- \"Welcome to the Jungle\"  \n- \"Gotta Have It\"  \n- \"Where I'm From\"  \n- \"Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)\"  \n- \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\"  \n- \"All Falls Down\"  \n- \"Flashing Lights\"  \n- \"Jesus Walks\"  \n- \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\"(Remix)  \n- \"Public Service Announcement\"  \n- \"U Don't Know\"  \n- \"Run This Town\"  \n- \"Monster\"  \n- \"Power\"  \n- \"New Day\"  \n- \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\"  \n- \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\"  \n- \"Empire State of Mind\"  \n- \"Runaway\"  \n- \"Heartless\"  \n- \"Stronger\"  \n- \"On to the Next One\"  \n- \"Dirt off Your Shoulder\"  \n- \"I Just Wanna Love U\"  \n- \"That's My Bitch\"  \n- \"Good Life\"  \n- \"Touch the Sky\"  \n- \"All of the Lights\"  \n- \"Big Pimpin'\"  \n- \"Gold Digger\"  \n- \"99 Problems\"  \n- \"No Church in the Wild\"  \n- \"Lift Off\"  \n- Niggas in Paris  \nEncore  \n## Tour dates  \n<image>The duo performed two shows at the historic Madison Square Garden on November 7 and 8.\n\n<image>Two Canadian shows of the tour took place at the Air Canada Centre\n\n\n### Box office score data  \n## Members  \nThe following individuals were members of the Watch The Throne tour:  \n* Mike Dean  \n* Mano  \n* Omar edwards  \n* Noah Goldstein (engineer)  \n* Che Pope  \n* Renelou Padora  \n* Don C  \n* Ibn Jasper  \n* Izvor Zivkovic  \n* Virgil Abloh  \n* Alex Rosenberg  \n* Matthew Williams  \n* Elon Rutberg  \n* Fabien Montique  \n* Tracey Mills  \n* Caitlyn Carpenter  \n* Hannah Christian  \n* Lara Holmes  \n* Ricky Anderson  \n* Sakiya Sandifer  \n* Justin Saunders  \n* Drew Goodman  \n## Credits  \n* Creative Direction & Set Design: Kanye West & Es Devlin  \n* Additional Set Design: Bruce Rodgers  \n* Lighting Designer: Nick Whitehouse & John McGuire  \n* Video Designer: Geodezik\n\nQuestion: Which venue hosted two shows during the tour where the artists from images 1 and 2 performed?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Maria Brignole Sale De Ferrari  \n<image>Maria Brignole Sale De Ferrari; photograph by Nadar\nMaria Brignole Sale De Ferrari, Duchess of Galliera (5 April 1811 – 9 December 1888) was an Italian noblewoman and philanthropist. She enabled the foundation of the first museums in her birthplace of Genoa, the Palazzo Rosso and Palazzo Bianco as well as the lt=Galliera Hospital and the San Filippo children's hospital. A statue of her by Giulio Monteverde stands in the hospital gardens.\n\n## Life  \n### Family  \nBelonging by birth to the House of Brignole-Sale, one of the most prestigious aristocratic families in Genoa and one which had produced several doges, she was born in the city's Palazzo Rosso to Antonio Brignole Sale, 11th Marquess of Groppoli and his wife Artemisia Negrone. Antonio's mother Anna Pieri had been a lady-in-waiting to Napoleon's second wife Marie Louise, whilst his sister Maria Pellegrina had married duke Emmerich von Dalberg, second only to Talleyrand in the French diplomatic corps.  \nAntonio too became a diplomat, taking his daughter to several European capitals and bringing her into contact with major figures of the era. Her parents' fervent Catholicism also instilled strong moral values which emerged when she had to decide how to use her huge fortune, since she had no heir to pass it onto. Maria's younger sister Luigia married the Duke of Lodi, it.  \n### Marriage  \nAged 17 she married marquess Raffaele De Ferrari (namesake of the main square in Genoa, piazza De Ferrari), making her by marriage Duchess of Galliera (a dukedom granted by the Pope in 1837) and Princess of Lucedio (granted by the King of Italy in 1875) and gaining her many lands and their coats of arms. Their early married life was marked by Raffaele accidentally killing a servant whilst intent on cleaning a firearm. The inquest returned a verdict of accidental death but Raffaele was so disturbed by the event that he immersed himself in his work, which took them to Paris. There he made his fortune in banking and the early French railway industry, thus hugely increasing his and his wife's already large fortunes. He disliked Paris but remained there on his wife's encouragement, she having fallen in love with the city's social life.  \n### Paris  \nThe Hôtel Matignon, now the official residence of the French Prime Minister.  \nFollowing the French Revolution of 1848 and Louis Philippe's death in 1850, the royal family sold off their properties to avoid bankruptcy. De Ferrari thus acquired the Hôtel Matignon at 57 rue de Varenne from the Duke of Montpensier in 1852. Renamed the Hôtel Galliera, this 18th century building had the largest private park in Paris and had been the residence of Maria's ancestor Maria Caterina Brignole-Sale (1737–1813), princess of Monaco. Maria herself called it \"comfortable so long as one did not have children\" and her husband little by little furnished it with the Brignole family art collection, starting with portraits by Anthony van Dyck and Hyacinthe Rigaud.  \nThe house's sumptuous parties and eminent guests are still noteworthy. As a personal friend of the former royal family of Bourbon-Orleans, Maria assigned some of them parts of the house during the difficult years of the Second French Republic and the Third French Republic until all the family members had left France. Maria left the house to the Austro-Hungarian Empire to house its French embassy before she left Paris for good – it was confiscated by France in 1922 as war reparations and since 1933 has been the official residence of the country's prime minister  \nThe couple's first child Livia died in 1829 before her first birthday, whilst their second child Andrea (1831–1847) died at a young age. Their third child Filippo (1850–1917) became an eccentric stamp-collector and found relations with his mother strained by her nostalgia for his two dead siblings and her sympathy for new socialist ideas. He chose to assume Austro-Hungarian citizenship and became an officer in that nation's army, renouncing most of his parents' wealth and titles and dying without issue.  \n### Philanthropy  \nPalazzo Rosso  \n<image>Villa Brignole Sale (Voltri). Photograph by Paolo Monti, 1964.\n\n<image>Musée Galliera, fashion museum in Paris\n\n<image>View of the orphanage in Meudon.\nRaffaele had in the meantime become senator of the Kingdom of Italy in 1858 and – now effectively without an heir thanks to Filippo's decisions – he decided to devote himself to public works and philanthropy, giving 20,000,000 lira to improve the Port of Genoa, money which also funded the construction of several other pieces of infrastructure, most notably the Galliera, Lucedio and Giano jetties. Raffaele died in 1876 and his widow continued his philanthropic activity as well as that begun by her father Antonio. As well as the \"Galliera\", \"S.Andrea\" and \"S.Filippo\" hospitals, sited around an old Franciscan nunnery, she founded a fourth, the \"San Raffaele\" in the city's Coronata district.  \nIn 1874 she donated Palazzo Rosso to the city and also left it Palazzo Bianco in her will – they became two of the three sites of the Strada Nuova Museums. In Paris she also built a palace to house her family art collection, but when the French government confiscated all the lands and buildings of the Orleans family, Maria decided to leave that palace to the city of Paris without the artworks, which she instead housed in Palazzo Rosso – the palace in Paris now houses a costume and fashion museum. She also built an old people's home and orphanage, both in Meudon near Paris, costing a total of 47,000,000 francs and both still in operation.  \nShe died in Paris and a special train took her body to Voltri for burial beside her husband in the crypt of the Sanctuary of Madonna delle Grazie, which he had acquired from the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1864 to return it to its original Capuchin owners, from whom it had been confiscated through the laws of that kingdom. The Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera in Voltri was left to a charitable \"opera pia\" – since 1931 it has been used and part-owned by the city council of Genoa. Since her son Filippo renounced his titles, the title of Duke of Galliera passed to the Duke of Montpensier, last surviving direct descendant of Louis Philippe, childhood friend of her son Andrea – it is still held by the Spanish Orleans branch. The dormant title of Marquess of Groppoli, which she inherited but never claimed, passed to her cousin Baron Acton.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following philanthropic contributions was made by Maria Brignole Sale De Ferrari?\nChoice list: \nA.

After emigrating to Sydney with his family from England as a boy he became an apprentice engineer, following his father's trade. Selfe designed many bridges, docks, boats, and much precision machinery for the city. He also introduced new refrigeration, hydraulic, electrical and transport systems. For these achievements he received international acclaim during his lifetime. Decades before the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built, the city came close to building a Selfe-designed steel cantilever bridge across the harbour after he won the second public competition for a bridge design.  \nSelfe was honoured during his life by the name of the Sydney suburb of Normanhurst, where his grand house Gilligaloola is a local landmark. He was energetically involved in organisations such as the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts and the Australian Historical Society. As president of the Board of Technical Education, he fought consistently for the establishment of an independent system of technical education to serve the needs of a rapidly industrialising society. He was acknowledged upon his death as one of the best-known people in, and greatest individual influences upon, the city of Sydney.  \n## Family background and apprenticeship  \nSelfe came from a long line of inventors and engineers. Both sides of his family came from Kingston upon Thames in London, where one grandfather had owned a plumbing and engineering works. His father Henry was a plumber and inventor, whose high-pressure fire-fighting hose was displayed at The Great Exhibition in London's Crystal Palace in 1851. Selfe's cousin Edward Muggeridge grew up in the same town but moved to the United States in 1855, restyled himself Eadweard Muybridge, and achieved global fame as a pioneer in the new field of photography.  \nThe Selfe family landed at Sydney's Semi-circular Quay in January 1855, when Norman was 15 years old. One of the reasons they emigrated to the colony of New South Wales was to enable him and his brother Harry to undertake engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby Rocks district in a small house that had previously been the first Sydney home of Mary Reibey, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship was apparent from a young age. The brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth, and were the first to construct a velocipede in the country.  \nSelfe very quickly began his career as an engineer, taking articles of apprenticeship to the ironmaster Peter Nicol Russell, at whose firm he worked in several departments and eventually became its chief draughtsman. He would remain there until 1864. In 1859, when PN Russell & Co expanded to a site in Barker Street near the head of Darling Harbour, Selfe drew up plans for the new works and the wharf, and oversaw their construction. In an address to the Engineering Section of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1900, Selfe recalled his work for Russell's:  \nWhile there I prepared plans for numbers of flour mills, and for the first ice-making machines, designing machinery for the multifarious requirements of colonial industries, many of which (such as sheep-washing and boiling down) no longer exist on the old lines.  \nWhile at Russell's, Selfe made several innovations in the design and construction of dredges for \"deeping our harbours and rivers\" – something of crucial importance to industry in early Sydney. He later recalled the success of Pluto, one of his dredges purchased by the government:  \nIn this there were several novelties introduced, and among them, the ladder was lifted by hydraulic power instead of by a chain from a winch ... The day of the official trial ... was a proud one for me, because during the course of the little festivities which followed their formal approval and official acceptance, head engineer Mr Dunlop pointedly remarked that \"as she was all right, the credit must be given to his boy in the drawing office\".  \n## Inventor and engineer  \nSelfe achieved international recognition in 1861 when leading British journal The Engineer published illustrations of his designs for one of the first refrigerating machines. One such machine was installed behind the Royal Hotel in George Street in Sydney's ice-works – one of the world's earliest commercial refrigeration plants. The decades following Selfe's arrival in Australia were watershed years in the development of refrigeration technology, and he was closely involved with its evolution. The introduction of refrigeration to the colony revolutionised farming, allowing the expansion of settlement, and made possible the export of meat and dairy products. In Sydney itself, refrigeration changed commercial practices and led to the eventual demise of city dairies. Selfe became an international authority on refrigeration engineering; he wrote articles and eventually a definitive textbook on the subject, published in the US in 1900.  \nIllustration of the SS Governor Blackall  \nAfter leaving Russell's, Selfe went into partnership with his former employer James Dunlop. They designed and built major installations for the Australasian Mineral Oil Company, the Western Kerosene Oil Company and the Australian Gas Light Company. In 1869 Selfe was appointed to the senior post of \"chief draftsman and scientific engineer\" at Mort's Dock and Engineering Company in Balmain. In this role he oversaw the design and construction of the mail ship SS Governor Blackall, personally commissioned for the Queensland government by the Premier Charles Lilley in 1869. The Sydney-built but Queensland-owned ship was an attempt to break what was later described as the \"capricious monopoly\" of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company on coastal trade and mail delivery from England. However, it ultimately caused the political downfall of Lilley as he had undertaken the contract without consulting his colleagues.  \n<image>Tourists ride in a coal skip on the \"scenic railway\", 1915\nSelfe left Mort's in 1877 to practise as a consulting engineer at 141 Pitt Street, gaining a reputation for versatility and originality. Upon his return from an overseas trip through America, Britain and continental Europe in 1884–85, where he visited engineering works and technical education facilities in search of new ideas to take back to Sydney, Selfe set up a new office in Lloyd's Chambers at 348 George Street. He would later move to No. 279 where he operated the consultancy until his death in 1911. In the late 1890s he employed William Dixson as an engineer, who would later make a major donation of Australiana to the State Library of New South Wales. The collection of Selfe's own papers and drawings have since been donated to the same library that his former employee greatly augmented.  \nSelfe designed the hulls or the machinery for some 50 steam vessels, including two torpedo boats for the New South Wales government, which he claimed were the fastest boats on the harbour for 20 years, and the SS Wallaby, Sydney Harbour's first double-ended screw ferry. Double-ended hulls remain the design of Sydney's current Freshwater-class ferries. He designed the first concrete quay wall in Sydney Harbour, and wharves for deep-sea vessels. He also designed the first ice-making machines in New South Wales, introduced the first lifts, patented an improved system of baling wool which increased capacity fourfold, and oversaw hydraulic and electric light installations in the city and the carriages on its railway network. He planned mills, waterworks and pumping stations, including the high-level pumps at the reservoir on Crown Street. He made major electric light installations at the Anthony Hordern & Sons department store and the Hotel Australia, and provided a hot-water system for the hotel. He designed machinery for factories, dairies and railways, including, in 1878, the incline of what is now the Scenic Railway attraction at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains – which claims to be the world's steepest. Its original purpose was the transportation of coal from the Jamison Valley to the cliff-top.  \nDuring his lifetime Selfe received both local and international recognition for his engineering skill. He had been president of both the Australian mechanical engineers' and naval architects' institutes as well as a member of both the British equivalent organisations. He was also elected a full member of the English Institution of Civil Engineers and, by virtue of his writings also being published in Chicago, also an honorary member of an American engineering association.\n\n## Sydney  \nSelfe's capacity for invention was not limited to the realm of machinery – he was also an energetic civic and urban reformer. He had high hopes for Sydney:  \n<image>Selfe's 1891 scheme for remodelling transport in The Rocks\n\"Every well wisher of Sydney, who sees and understands what magnificent latent possibilities there are before her must hope that she will for all time be the Queen City of the Southern Hemisphere; and that the new century will open finding old ways departed from, and a glorious new era of progress, prosperity, morality and cleanliness installed in our midst. When that day arrives, we shall look back with curiosity and wonder at the continued blindness and negligence from which our city – so highly gifted by nature – had suffered so long.\"  \nFrom the time of Selfe's return in 1886 from two years' travel in the United States and Europe, he campaigned for improvements to the city of Sydney. These included proposals for a city railway loop, the redevelopment of the Rocks, and a bridge to the North Shore. His obituary in The Sydney Morning Herald noted, \"Mr. Selfe for over twenty years was a strenuous advocate of a circular city railway that should connect up the eastern, western, and northern suburbs of the city with the marine suburbs of the harbour, and stations adjacent to the ferries\". He published plans and proposals elaborating on his ideas, and produced major articles with titles like \"Sydney: past, present and possible\" and \"Sydney and its institutions, as they are, and might be from an engineer's point of view\".  \nIn 1887 Selfe published proposals for a city underground railway, with stations at Wynyard, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to Woolloomooloo and the eastern suburbs. The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; but nothing was to come of it, largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.  \nIn 1908–09 he served as one of 11 expert commissioners to the Royal Commission for the Improvement of the City of Sydney and its Suburbs. Selfe's proposals included an overhead railway station at Circular Quay and major landscaping works at Belmore Park opposite Central Railway Station. Both of these visions were later realised, but not in his lifetime.\n\n### Sydney Harbour Bridge  \nSelfe's winning design for the proposed Harbour Bridge c. 1903  \nBy the late 1890s a harbour crossing and a city railway extension were again on the agenda. The Lyne government committed to building the new Central Railway Station, and organised a worldwide competition for the design and construction of a Harbour Bridge. Selfe submitted a design for a suspension bridge estimated to cost £1,128,000 and won the second prize of £500. The first prize went to C. E. W. Crutwell, of Westminster with a design estimated to cost more than twice as much. After the outcome of the competition had become mired in controversy, in 1902 Selfe won a second competition outright, with a design for a steel cantilever bridge stretching from Dawes Point to McMahons Point. The selection board were unanimous, commenting that \"The structural lines are correct and in true proportion, and ... the outline is graceful\".  \nConstruction of Selfe's version of the Sydney harbour bridge never started due to an economic slowdown and a change of government at the 1904 state election. Much to Selfe's outrage, the Department of Public Works kept his calculations and drawings, and also copied and printed them. Eventually in 1907, the department contacted Selfe and asked him to collect his drawings, but refused to return the calculations. Selfe was never given the £1,100 prize, nor was he paid for his subsequent work which he estimated to be worth more than £20,000.  \n<image>One of Selfe's proposal blueprints, now held at the Mitchell Library\nAmong the Selfe family papers in Mitchell Library there is a large collection of postcards featuring bridges from across the world. Some were sent to Selfe by friends and relatives from Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Others, un-postmarked, were collected on his travels in 1884–85. These would have formed a research catalogue of contemporary international bridge-building practices for Selfe's own designs.  \nIn 1908, Selfe presented new proposals based upon the old design to the Royal Commission on Communication between Sydney and North Sydney. However, this time the commissioners preferred a tunnel scheme; again, no work proceeded. Agitation for a bridge was renewed with the election of a Labor government at the 1910 state election. But with Selfe's death in 1911, it was time for a new generation of bridge builders. In 1912 the government appointed J.J. Bradfield as \"engineer-in-chief of Sydney Harbour Bridge and City Transit\"; the call for tenders for constructing the bridge was not made until a decade later. Over the following decades, versions of what Selfe had much earlier articulated for a city circle railway link and a bridge to the north shore were realised. Selfe's contribution received little public or formal recognition.\n\n## Historian  \nSelfe was founding vice-president of the Australian Historical Society in 1901, serving with president Andrew Houison and patron David Scott Mitchell (after whom the Mitchell wing of the State Library of New South Wales is named). He remained actively involved in the society for 10 years, despite what he called \"the evident lack of interest ... taken in the proceedings of the Society\" by the general public in the early years. The society got off to a shaky start, with low attendance of lectures and meetings. Early papers delivered by Selfe included \"A century of Sydney Cove\" and \"Some notes on the Sydney windmills\". Slowly, interest increased, and by 1905 membership had reached 100. Known as the Royal Australian Historical Society (RAHS) since 1918, and housed in a grand Victorian style townhouse on Macquarie Street, the organisation is Australia's oldest historical society; Selfe is celebrated as one of its pioneers.  \n## Technical education  \nSelfe was a key figure in the history of technical education in New South Wales. He advocated a more utilitarian and less literary education system, to produce a skilled workforce that could realise Australia's potential as an efficient industrial state. He was utopian in his vision:  \nThere is no doubt that it is on the work of tools directed by brains that the future of Australia depends more than anything else. With tools our Australian deserts may be turned into gardens ... They will pluck the hidden treasure from the bowels of the earth, enable us to soar in the air, or explore the depths of the water. They will weave a network of communication over our island continent, dot it with the homes of a happy people, and minister to our wants in providing not only the necessities and comforts of life, but the most refined luxuries that are needed to satisfy the novel and exacting wants which arise every day, as the standard of intellectual and technical cultivation is raised and extended among us ...  \nSelfe believed an overhaul of education was needed, from kindergarten to tertiary study. His concept of technical education encompassed Friedrich Fröbel's kindergarten activities based around play and occupations; the teaching of drawing, manual work and science in schools; and specialised practical training of workmen and professionals in technical colleges. He argued for the establishment of a new kind of university – an \"industrial university\", less theory-oriented and more concerned with the practical and the useful. He saw technical education as a distinct sphere of education to be administered and delivered by people with practical industry experience, not government officials or traditional teachers.  \n### Teacher  \n<image>Sydney Technical College in Ultimo c. 1890\nAs early as 1865 Selfe gave regular classes in mechanical drawing to tradesmen at the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts in Pitt Street. Selfe's class in mechanical drawing was the first technical, vocational offering at the School of Arts, and its popularity led to the introduction of other practical subjects.  \nDue to the colony's rapidly expanding population and demand for skilled labour, there were increasing calls in the 1870s for a formal system of technical education. In 1870, Selfe helped found the Engineering Association of New South Wales which amalgamated into Engineers Australia in 1919. He was its president from 1877 to 1879 and Engineers Australia annually awards the \"Norman Selfe Medal\" to a student at the Australian Maritime College. In 1878, the association joined forces with the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council and the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts to form the Technical and Working Men's College. The college initially operated as an agency of the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts. The college occupied premises in Pitt, Sussex and Castlereagh Streets, and rooms in the Royal Arcade, before it moved to Ultimo in 1889. The college later became the Sydney Technical College out of which grew the University of New South Wales, the University of Technology, Sydney, and the National Art School. The Ultimo buildings still serve their original purpose, now as the main campus of the Sydney Institute of TAFE.  \nIn 1880, Selfe became vice president of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead for the establishment of a proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.\n\n### Critic  \nOn 1 August 1883 the New South Wales government made a proclamation which transferred control of the Technical and Working Men's College to an independent Board of Technical Education, to which Selfe was appointed, and assumed financial responsibility directly. The government also provided funds to fit out workshops in Kent Street that opened in 1886. This was an initiative driven by Selfe, who had admired the workshop teaching model abroad. It represented a major innovation in technical education in New South Wales.  \nMany of the board's initiatives were based on observations made abroad by Selfe and board president Edward Combes, or recommendations made by the British Royal Commission into Technical Education of 1881–84. However, most of the board's schemes were frustrated by an unresponsive colonial government. Norm Neill, historian of the early years of the Sydney Technical College, argues that the Board caused many of its own problems:  \nThere was a marked lack of unity ... Members either resigned or became inactive and the Board failed to accept that its autonomy was more nominal than real. Any expansion of technical education was dependent on government funding and governments were unlikely to allocate resources to an organisation unwilling or unable to cooperate.  \nSelfe was president of the Board from January 1887 until it was disbanded in 1889. During this time the relationship between the board and the government deteriorated with Selfe being overtly critical of two powerful institutions: the newly formed Department of Public Instruction and the University of Sydney. Selfe strongly opposed the government's taking control of technical education, which had been underway since the government first declared its interest in doing so at a special meeting of the Sydney Mechanics School of Arts in September 1883. He also did not support an alternative proposal that the University of Sydney should take over. In an address at the annual presentation of prizes at Sydney Technical College in 1887, Selfe alienated the Minister of Public Instruction and others by being openly contemptuous of the traditional pursuits of schools and universities:  \nThe whole experience of the past goes to show that the learning of the schools has had little, if anything, to do with the material advancement of the world, and that while it may have produced intellectual giants, subjective teaching has not brought forth those men who have been inventors and manufacturers that have entirely changed the character of our civilisation.  \nSelfe criticised the classical liberal arts education offered at the University of Sydney as elitist. In his 1888 address to Sydney Technical College students on prize night, he again caused affront to the establishment when he called for greater diversity of educational opportunities in the colony:  \nIt is not ... easy ... to see why the general public should pay so many thousands a year to make our future professional men in medicine and law in the colony, to form part of the so-called upper classes, when our \"principles\" will not allow us to pay just a little more in order to have, say, our locomotives made here, and when we are doing so very little, proportionately, to train and educate the artisans who make these locomotives, and who belong to a much less wealthy and influential level in society.  \nIn 1889 the colonial government, already in financial control, assumed direct operational control by abolishing the Board and placing the college within the Technical Education Branch of the Department of Public Instruction (now the New South Wales Department of Education).  \n### Reformer  \nIn the early years of the 20th century, education remained a major political issue in New South Wales. While Selfe would not be drawn again into the centre of the fray, he supported the efforts of his sister Maybanke and her second husband Francis Anderson towards education reform. Following the Knibbs-Turner Royal Commission into New South Wales Education in 1902, and the appointment of Peter Board as Director of Education in 1905, many of Selfe's ideas for technical education were implemented. Ultimately, in 1949, a separate Department of Technical Education was created, and the New South Wales University of Technology (later the University of New South Wales) was established at Kensington.  \nLes Mandelson, historian of Australia's education systems, categorises Selfe as \"a nineteenth century protagonist for the New Education\", who helped pave the way for the extensive reforms of the twentieth century. \"Without him\", he adds, \"education in the late nineteenth century would have been decidedly more mundane\". However, Mandelson sounds a critical note:  \nSelfe's contempt for the liberal arts tradition and the priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended. These reflected and augmented ... one of the less attractive features of the Australian ethos – indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments, an indifference shading into contempt and suspicion ... Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, the liberal arts tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised is that in the vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in the liberal arts tradition was lost.  \nBiographer Stephen Murray-Smith is more generous in his assessment of Selfe's contribution to education debates around the turn of the twentieth century: \"Selfe went beyond the concept of helping the working man to achieve a share of the good things hitherto reserved for others, towards the concept of leading him to create good things for himself.\"  \nSelfe was a noted activist for the Federation of Australia being a member of the Central Federation League. Edward Dowling, his colleague on the inaugural board of the Australian Historical Society, was also the Secretary of the Central League of the Australasian Federation League and his former articled engineer John Jacob Cohen would later be elected at the 1898 New South Wales election in the seat of Petersham representing the National Federal Party.  \n## Personal life  \nWhen Selfe obtained a steady job after his apprenticeship, he brought his family with him from The Rocks to live at Balmain. Selfe bought waterfront land and built twin terraced houses called Normanton and Maybank, which are still at 21 and 23 Wharf Road, Birchgrove. It is likely that Selfe shared Normanton with his widowed mother. Next door lived his brother Harry, his sister Maybanke and his brother-in-law Edmund Wolstenholme.  \nSelfe was a supportive brother, both emotionally and materially. His sister Maybanke bore seven children to her first husband Edmund, four of whom died as infants from tuberculosis. He also provided financial support after Maybanke's marriage came to an end. Maybanke earned fame in her own right as a prominent suffragist and pioneer of education for women and girls. In the 1890s brother and sister campaigned together for education reform.  \nAmesbury, designed by Selfe and built in 1888  \nOn 10 October 1872 at St Mary's Church, Balmain Selfe married Emily Ann Booth, the daughter of John Booth, a well-known shipbuilder and Balmain's first mayor (and formerly the member for East Macquarie in the colonial parliament). They lived for many years at Rockleigh in Donnelly Street, Balmain, a house that has since been demolished. In 1884 their first daughter Rhoda Jane was born, followed by a stillborn daughter in 1886, and then Norma Catherine in 1888. In 1885 Selfe bought land in Ashfield and designed a grand house called Amesbury. Described at the time as having \"more novelties both externally and internally than any other house in the colony\" including terracotta lyrebird reliefs by artist Lucien Henry on the front wall, and a tower purpose-built for Selfe to pursue his hobby of astronomy. Built around 1888 to honour the centenary of the colony, Amesbury still stands at 78 Alt Street and was used by Brahma Kumaris from 1986 as its Australian headquarters until 2014 when it was auctioned for over $3.5 million. As children, Rhoda and Norma attended their Aunt Maybanke's school in Dulwich Hill. As adults, they trained in Italy with educator Maria Montessori and returned to Sydney to open a Montessori school of their own in the building known as Warwick on Bland Street, Ashfield.  \nAround 1894, the family moved, this time to Hornsby Shire, where a new Selfe-designed house, Gilligaloola, was built on ha purchased by Selfe ten years earlier. Situated at what is now 82 Pennant Hills Road, the house is still a local landmark, notable for its distinctive tower and twin chimneys. Selfe was a committed citizen and a natural spokesman for the local community, to the extent that when the railways needed a name for the locality, the community chose Normanhurst (though Selfe himself felt that St Normans would have been \"much more elegant and suggestive\").  \nOn 12 May 1906, four years after the death of his first wife, Selfe married Marion Bolton at St Philip's Church, Sydney.  \n### Death  \n<image>The Selfe-designed house Gilligaloola in which he lived from 1894 until his death\nSelfe died suddenly on 15 October 1911. His death certificate states the cause of death as \"heart failure brought on by exertion\". His daughter Norma offered some context to a journalist in 1957. She said:  \n\"On the day of his death he climbed trees in the church grounds to lop branches, as the gardener was too nervous to climb so high. That night he died in his sleep.\"  \nNorma reported that her father had been sanguine to the end, playful with his nephews and learning to play the oboe. However, other reports suggest that Selfe was concealing a bitter sense of disappointment at the end of his life, most particularly over the Harbour Bridge affair. His obituary in the journal Building concluded:  \n... There is none today who can replace the noble personality, that keen energetic brain ever ready to give of its wonderful store of knowledge, and that happy spirit ever bright, ever optimistic, even though crushed beneath the cruel and unjust blow of the non-acceptance of his prize design for the North Shore bridge. \"It will crown my life\" he said. We will always remember the bright gleam in his eyes as they peered beyond the anxiety of today, looked afar to the future glory of his beloved Sydney where in his dreams he saw his mighty bridge spanning what he called \"God's noblest waterway\".  \nSelfe's funeral was held at St Paul's Church, Wahroonga, where he had been a churchwarden. He was buried in Gore Hill cemetery in the presence of a large gathering of businessmen and representatives of the organisations he had been involved with. He was survived by his two daughters from his first marriage, Rhoda and Norma, and his second wife, Marion. His estate was valued for probate at nearly £5000. Twenty-one years later, on 11 March 1932 Marion's charred body was found in her new house, also in Normanhurst where she lived alone, having reportedly set fire to her clothes when lighting a candle. Marion was buried alongside Norman in plot CE I:7. Rhoda's ashes were also placed nearby when she died aged 69 in 1954, still living in Gilligaloola.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following contributions is Norman Selfe known for, as depicted in the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

Contested over 404 laps—extended from 400 laps due to an overtime finish, on the one-mile (1.6 km) concrete speedway, it was the 30th race of the 2018 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season, fourth race of the Playoffs, and the first race of the Round of 12.  \n## Report  \n### Background  \n<image>Dover International Speedway, the track where the race was held.\nDover International Speedway (formerly Dover Downs International Speedway) is a race track in Dover, Delaware, United States. Since opening in 1969, it has held at least two NASCAR races. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosted USAC and the Verizon IndyCar Series. The track features one layout, a km concrete oval, with 24° banking in the turns and 9° banking on the straights. The speedway is owned and operated by Dover Motorsports.  \nThe track, nicknamed \"The Monster Mile\", was built in 1969 by Melvin Joseph of Melvin L. Joseph Construction Company, Inc., with an asphalt surface, but was replaced with concrete in 1995. Six years later in 2001, the track's capacity moved to 135,000 seats, making the track have the largest capacity of sports venue in the mid-Atlantic. In 2002, the name changed to Dover International Speedway from Dover Downs International Speedway after Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment split, making Dover Motorsports. From 2007 to 2009, the speedway worked on an improvement project called \"The Monster Makeover\", which expanded facilities at the track and beautified the track. After the 2014 season, the track's capacity was reduced to 95,500 seats.\n\n#### Entry list  \n## First practice  \nKyle Larson was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 21.892 seconds and a speed of abbr=on.  \n## Qualifying  \nQualifying for Friday was cancelled due to rain and Kyle Busch, the point leader, was awarded the pole as a result.  \n### Starting Lineup  \n## Practice (post-qualifying)  \n### Second practice  \nSecond practice session scheduled for Saturday was cancelled due to rain.  \n### Final practice  \nFinal practice  \nKyle Larson was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 22.640 seconds and a speed of abbr=on.  \n## Race  \n<image>Chase Elliott won the race.\nKyle Busch led the field to green, only to be passed by Kevin Harvick ten laps later. Harvick swept both stages. Harvick led until about 50 to go when he had a loose wheel. Aric Almirola inherited the lead from his mistake-cursed teammate. Almirola maintained the lead until a caution with ten to go, caused by a crashed SHR car of Clint Bowyer. Chase Elliott boldly opted not to pit, taking the lead. On the restart Elliott surfed ahead of Almirola, who would ultimately wreck with Brad Keselowski a half lap later, sending the race into overtime. At the restart, Elliott forged ahead of Denny Hamlin, a rival from Martinsville and Phoenix in 2017.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Unitary psychosis  \nUnitary psychosis (Einheitspsychose) refers to the 19th-century belief prevalent in German psychiatry until the era of Emil Kraepelin that all forms of psychosis were surface variations of a single underlying disease process. According to this model, there were no distinct disease entities in psychiatry but only varieties of a single universal madness and the boundaries between these variants were fluid. The prevalence of the concept in Germany during the mid-19th century can be understood in terms of a general resistance to Cartesian dualism and faculty psychology as expressed in Naturphilosophie and other Romantic doctrines that emphasised the unity of body, mind and spirit.  \n## 19th-century proponents  \n### Joseph Guislain  \n<image>paraphrénie (folie); hyperplexie (stupidity); hyperspasmie (epilepsy); ideosynchysie (hallucinations); analcouthie (confusion); and noasthénie (dementia).\n\n\n### Ernst Albrecht von Zeller  \nErnst Albrecht von Zeller (1804–1877)  \nGuislain's thesis was taken up by the German psychiatrist Ernst Albrecht von Zeller (1804–1877), who translated his text into German in 1837. Zeller was the medical director of a private asylum at Winnenthal in Württemberg. He would become perhaps the figure most associated with the concept of unitary psychosis in German psychiatry. In 1834 he had already declared that the different varieties of mental illness were simply differing stages in a common morbid process and that \"in the course of one case all the main forms of mental disorder may occur\". His adoption of the concept of unitary madness was predicated on his belief in the unity of the human soul or character and that man was at once composed of both material and spiritual elements. Deriving this belief in part from Naturphilosophie and the influence of anthropology on German psychiatric concepts, he held that it was this fundamental spiritual self that was afflicted in madness. For Zeller, both organic and moral (or psychological) causes combined to produce mental illness. The organic causes of mental illness were, he argued, observable in the physical illnesses that preceded its onset. He reasoned, however, that \"cases are rare in which the mental disorder is caused by purely organic problems of the central nervous system\". Instead, he held that the psychological pain occasioned by remorse, guilt, poverty and social reversal was the universal causal factor in all forms of mental morbidity. Somatic and moral factors and the pain attendant on the latter combined variously to produce the four stages of a universal disease: melancholia (the fundamental form of mental disorder which led to the other stages), mania, paranoia and, finally, dementia.  \n### Wilhelm Griesinger  \nWilhelm Griesinger (1817–1868)  \nFor a period of two years from 1840 Wilhelm Griesinger (1817–1868) worked as a medical assistant to Zeller at the Winnental Asylum. While there, he adopted and adapted his senior colleague's model of a unitary psychosis. He did not, however, shares Zeller's conviction regarding the nature of the human soul or character and its role in madness. A convinced somaticist and commonly considered one of the founders of materialist psychiatry, in the 1845 text which established him as one of the leading scientific psychiatrists of his era, Pathologie and Therapie der psychischen Krankheiten, he conceived of character, or \"psychological tonus\", as derived from the action of a postulated \"psychic reflex action\" (psychische Reflexaktion) produced by the stimulus of the accumulated representations (Vorstellungen) of the individual's life experience. The concept of psychic reflex action was drawn by analogy from the physiological reflex action of the nervous system in response to a stimulus and he argued that both forms of reflex had the same mode of action and obeyed the same physical laws.  Mental illnesses occurred, he posited, when the system of psychic reflex action failed to function correctly and were either diminished, leading to melancholia, or accelerated, leading to mania. His belief was that mental illness was a disease of the brain but that this in turn was caused by psychological factors. His emphasis on the brain as the central site of mental illness has led to his association with the so-called Somatiker (somaticists) who had argued that the causes of mental illness were entirely physical whereas their opponents, the Psychiker, insisted that mental disorders were the result of psychological perversions, moral failings, or diseases of the soul (Seelenkrankheit). As with Zeller, he postulated that melancholia constituted the primary form of mental illness which then passed to mania before terminating in dementia. In his 1861 text Mental Pathology and Therapeutics Griesinger proposed a classificatory division of types of mental anomalies between those characterised by emotional disturbances and those characterised by disturbances in the intellectual and volitional functions. He argued, based on his observation of cases, that the former condition preceded the latter where disorders of the intellect and will appeared \"only as consequences and terminations\" of disturbances of the emotions if \"the cerebral affliction has not been cured\". These two categories thus constituted, for Griesigner, \"the different forms and the different stages of one morbid process\". The general trajectory of this mental pathology tended towards \"a constant progressive course, which may even proceed to complete destruction of the mental life\". Greisinger maintained his belief in unitary psychosis until the 1860s.  \n### Heinrich Neumann  \nThe greatest defender and the most radical proponent of the concept of unitary psychosis in the 19th century was the German psychiatrist Heinrich Neumann (1814–88). Switching from general medicine to psychiatry in the 1850s, he became the owner of a private psychiatric clinic and from 1874 to 1884 he attained the post of medical director at a university-based clinical ward in the Breslau city hospital (now Wroclaw in Poland). He was succeeded by his former medical assistant, Carl Wernicke, a noted neuropsychiatrist. In his Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie (Textbook of Psychiatry) of 1859 he rejected any attempt at psychiatric classification as \"artificial\". He asserted that, \"There is only one type of mental disorder. We call it madness (Irresein). Insanity does not possess different forms but different stages; they are called insanity (Wahnsinn), confusion (Verwirrheit), and dementia (Blödsinn).\" Neumann exceeded the position of previous adherents of the unitarian concept by propounding not simply a continuum among diseases but also between disease and health. Thus, he argued that, \"sleeplessness, illusions, exaggerated sensitivity... cause illness, then madness, confusion, and dementia\". The proposed mechanism underlying this process was what Neumann termed \"metamorphosis\" which referred to a disturbance in consciousness that led to errors in the interpretation of sensations. For Neumann an overabundance of stimulation produced mental irritation and mania. As this depleted mental energy it could then result in hallucinations. The medical historian Eric Engstrom has argued that Neumann's proposal to subsume the entire range of diverse psychiatric symptomatology into the concept of Einheitspsychose had the virtue of flexibility in its capacity to absorb any system of psychiatric classification. Engstom has also noted that the concept supported calls for the early committal to asylums of all potential patients as it did not link the likelihood of remission to disease classification but rather argued for early intervention to prevent the onset of chronic mental disability. Its wider support among asylum-based alienists (as medical practitioners in mental hospitals were then known) as opposed to academic psychiatrists was due to the fact that it was more applicable to the unhurried tempo of asylum routine where, unlike in university clinics, there was no perceived need for rapid diagnosis. Equally, medical formation in the asylum setting was focused on protracted clinical observation rather than the formal pedagogy of a standardised university curriculum.  \n## 19th-century critics  \n### Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum  \n<image>Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum (1828–1899)\nFrom the 1860s the concept of unitary psychosis and its advocates came under increasing criticism. Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum (1829–1899), a German psychiatrist of seminal importance in the development of the modern nosology and a formative influence on the work of Emil Kraepelin, had taken issue with Neumann's assertion in his 1859 text that mental illness could not be categorised into discrete disease entities. Kahlbaum fashioned a response in 1863 with the publication of his Die Gruppierung der psychischen Krankheiten (The Classification of Psychiatric Diseases). This text delineated four distinct types of mental illness (vesania): vesania acuta, vesania typica, vesania progressiva and vesania catatonica. He asserted that the unitarian position signalled the \"end to all diagnosis in the field of psychopathology.\" For Kahlbaum, Neumann's failure to engage in any attempt at disease classification, his rejection of diagnosis as abstraction and his focus only upon the individual manifestation of mental illness constituted an enterprise without any scientific validity. In the absence of meaningful and acute diagnostic categories in psychiatry Kahlbaum believed that both the development of effective therapeutic practices and the knowledge of mental illness would run stagnant.\n\n### Emil Kraepelin  \nDuring his inaugural lecture following his appointment to the chair of psychiatry in Dorpat University in 1887, Kraepelin contended that Zeller's notion of unitary psychosis had led to the calcification of clinical research in Germany until as late as the 1860s. The revival of a more objective clinical approach built upon observation, he contended, had had to await the contribution of researchers such as Ludwig Snell who wrote on monomania as a distinct disease entity in the 1870s. Kraepelin's approach to classification of mental illness was based on longitudinal studies of symptoms, course and outcome. He concluded from his studies that there were only two major forms of serious mental illness: dementia praecox and manic depression. This division of the psychoses, currently enshrined in modern classification systems as that between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and referred to as the Kraepelinian dichotomy, has remained in place for more than a hundred years.  \n## 20th-century revivals  \nKlaus Conrad (1905–1961)  \nVariations of the unitary psychosis thesis have been revived occasionally during the 20th century. These have generally taken the form of statistical analyses that purport to demonstrate that the Kraeplinian division is unstable. In the modern era the concept of schizoaffective psychosis, which straddles the Kraepelinian divide, when delineated as a condition sharing a common causal pathway as both schizophrenia and affective psychosis, shares aspects of the more radical notion of unitary psychosis in regarding the individual psychoses as points on a continuum.  \n### Klaus Conrad  \nKlaus Conrad (1905–1961), a German neuropsychiatrist and a member of the Nazi party from 1940, became convinced that there was only one endogenous psychosis based partly upon his observation that cyclothymic patients, or those suffering from affective psychosis, often sired schizophrenic children. He also held the belief, derived from his clinical experience, that symptoms associated with particular diagnostic categories were fluid and that a patient could, for instance, exhibit signs of mania or depression which might then reappear periodically and subsequently develop delusions and undergo a deterioration in personality. Likewise, symptoms thought to be characteristic of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations and catatonia, were, he alleged, also found in depression and mania. Conrad also contested the then established classificatory division between the endogenous and exogenous psychoses or, respectively, psychoses of internal or external origin, as whether the disease causing agent was \"physical exhaustion or heightened emotion\" it \"attacked the same structure, physiological mechanism, biological metabolism\". Conrad, a proponent of Gestalt psychology, is typically characterised as having expounded a view of psychosis that is commensurate with the mid-19th century psychiatric concept of unitary psychosis.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following individuals played a significant role in the development of modern psychiatric nosology and criticized the concept of unitary psychosis?\nChoice list: \nA.

His most notable contribution to botany was the founding of the long-lived journal \"Flora Batava\" in 1800 and contributing text for the first 10 volumes.\n\n## Biography  \nJan Kops was the son of Jacobus Kops, a yarn merchant, and Hillegond Schotvanger, both conservative Old Frisian Mennonites. On the death of his father in December 1773, Jan Kops with his stepmother and sister moved from Amsterdam to Haarlem, where he received tuition first at the French and then at the Latin school. He was expected to follow the family tradition of a career in the textile industry, but Kops was ambitious and wanted a more extensive education. For the moment he immersed himself in a study of Dutch literature and botany.  \nIn December 1781 Kops enrolled at the Amsterdam Theological Seminary, a move which was not his first choice, as he would rather have followed his interest in botany and natural history, but understood that these were not lucrative fields. Anabaptists, such as Kops, were systematically excluded from public office. However this did not deter Kops from attending courses in the natural sciences at the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam.  \nIn April 1787 Kops passed his examination at the Anabaptist seminary and served as pastor at Leiden until 1800, enrolling at the local university for a number of courses. In his spare time he was kept busy by his interest in literature.  \nA great setback in Kops' church career was his being passed over in 1792 as preacher for the Haarlem congregation, the same thing happening in Amsterdam. Kops was furious over this and sought diversion in botany. As a consequence the first part of \"Flora Batava\" appeared in 1800. The Batavian Revolution led to the Mennonites' being placed on equal footing with the Dutch Reformed Church, and in 1795 and 1796 he was a member and chairman of Leiden's local authority.  \nKops next turned his attention to agriculture, and looked into the possibility of turning the dune region into productive farmland. He assembled a panel of agricultural experts and approached the Provincial Administration of Holland, setting out his ideas. His proposals met with a favourable reception and in September 1796 a study group was put together with Kops as secretary, and a report soon followed. His reputation as agronomist firmly established by the report, he was appointed in June 1800 as director of agriculture in the Netherlands, causing him to leave the ministry in Leiden and take up an office at The Hague, a post he was to fill until 1815. In this new capacity Kops undertook a tour of five months through the Netherlands, enabling him to personally judge the state of the nation's agriculture. On his initiative the first Dutch agricultural magazine Magazijn van Vaderlandschen Landbouw appeared between 1803 and 1814. He also initiated the formation of 10 regional agricultural commissions to advise the government. In 1808 he established the first \"Agricultural Cabinet\" to provide farmers with assistance and advice on farming equipment and implements.  \nHis previous interests resurfaced and in 1815 he was appointed professor of botany and agricultural economics at the University of Utrecht, a position he would hold until 1835. In this period he also preached as minister from 1816 to 1843 to the Mennonites in Utrecht, The Hague and Amsterdam.  \n## Flora Batava  \nThe first issue of \"Flora Batava\" was published in Amsterdam in 1800, with illustrations that were provided by artists working under J. C. Sepp & Son. The publisher Jan Christiaan Sepp was not only a Mennonite, but also an engraver, etcher, bookseller, author and illustrator. The final issue, volume 28, was published in 1934. Willem Jan Lütjeharms, the editor for that volume, stated that the work had ended and its publication had stretched over more years than any other botanical magazine. The work of text, illustrations and printing had changed hands many times during the course of its history. Several artists had produced the illustrations, but since the plates were unsigned, attribution is difficult. Most of the illustrations in the first three volumes were from the hand of (Georg Jacob Johann van Os), a flower and fruit painter for the Sèvres porcelain factory.  \nKops chose the title of his work for historical reasons; \"Batavia\" was a region of the Netherlands when it still formed part of the Roman Empire. Flora Batava was the name given the garden of Agnes Block (1629-1704), an art collector and horticulturist. She was the daughter of a Mennonite textile merchant and after the death of her first husband she bought a country estate on the Vecht River in Loenen and named it Vijverhof. A procession of artists, including Maria Sibylla Merian, visited her home and left behind a large number of paintings of flowers from her garden.  \nKops married Catharina Daams (1768-1805) in January 1788, the marriage producing 6 sons and 5 daughters. After the death of Catharina in 1805, Kops was married in 1807 to Helena Biljouw (1774-1855). From this marriage came 5 sons and 1 daughter, 3 of the 5 sons dying young.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a plate from the journal \"Flora Batava\"?\nChoice list: \nA.

He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1844.  \n## Early life  \nSt Mary's Bellevue, Edinburgh  \n<image>Henry Grey by Hill & Adamson\n\n<image>Henry Grey of Edinburgh by John Kay\n5 East Claremont Street, Edinburgh  \nGrey was born on 11 February 1778, at Alnwick, Northumberland. His father was a physician in Morpeth. His education was at a private school in Highhedgely with a final 18 months in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In Newcastle he attended lectures by Henry Moyes (on a tour of Britain) and was greatly influenced by his thinking. His mother had an early breach with his father, and after his education moved with her son to Edinburgh in 1793. There he passed through the usual course of study preparatory to entering into the office of the ministry in the Church of Scotland. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Edinburgh in November 1800. He was ordained in 1801.1890\n\n## Ministry  \nGrey's sympathies were wholly with the evangelical portion of the church.  \nIn September 1801 he was ordained as minister of the parish of Stenton in East Lothian. This was a quiet place, where he spent 12 years, including getting married and starting a family. In 1813 he was called to the Buccleuch Chapel in south Edinburgh - a charge recently formed by Rev Sir Wellwood-Moncrieff, as a Chapel of Ease to St. Cuthbert's parish to address the growing population inn south Edinburgh. Grey's discourses were presented in a scholarly style and fervent manner, leading the way for Andrew Mitchell Thomson and Thomas Chalmers.1890  \n### Apocrypha Controversy  \nHenry Grey and his wife  \nOn 11 January 1821 Grey was appointed to the New North Church, one of the four parish churches of Edinburgh contained within St Giles Cathedral, in place of the late Rev David Dickson. In October 1824 the town council chose Grey as minister of St Mary's Church in the Bellevue district (which was still under construction) and on completion in January 1825 he was therefore its first minister, his first service there being on the first Sunday after 13 January.  \nIn the lead up to the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, Grey had taken part in agitation against slavery in the West Indies.  \nFour years after this last change of post, Grey clashed with Andrew Thomson, and they took opposite sides in the Apocrypha Controversy; they had been warm personal friends.1890  \nIn the ecclesiastical struggle of the next few years, Grey opposed the civil courts. At the Disruption of 1843 he left the Church of Scotland and joined the Free Church of Scotland. Taking a large proportion of the Bellevue congregation with him, and had a new church built for him on the north side of Barony Street, 300m south of the original church. The building held a congregation of 800. This structure was short-lived, as it was not intended as the permanent home of the congregation. Although Grey was involved in the contract for the permanent building (on the corner of Albany street and Broughton Street) it was not completed until after Grey's death due to contractual problems.  \nIn 1844, Grey was chosen as the second Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church. In the jubilee year of his ministry, a public testimonial was presented to him, which was turned into a foundation for the Grey Scholarships in the New College, Edinburgh.1890 Grey's elders included David Octavius Hill.  \nA political reformer, he was the target of adverse criticism from some who agreed with his religious views.1890  \n## Death  \nThe grave of Rev Henry Grey DD, St Cuthberts Churchyard, Edinburgh  \nGrey retired from active ministry in 1857 with Free St Mary's being taken over by Rev Thomas Main.  \nGrey died suddenly in his eighty-first year, on Thursday 13 January 18591890 at his home 5 East Claremont Street, a very large Georgian flat on the eastern fringe of the Edinburgh New Town.  \nHe is buried in St Cuthbert's Churchyard at the west end of Princes Street with his wife Margaretta (1786–1858) and children Emily Isabella and George Edward Grey. The grave lies in the north-east corner of the northernmost section, abutting the churchyard of St John.  \n## Family  \nIn October 1808 he married his cousin Margaretta Grey (1786-1858) eldest daughter of his paternal uncle, Rev George Grey of West Ord in Northumberland.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Xiaomi  \nXiaomi's Redmi Note  \n<image>l=), commonly known as Xiaomi and registered as Xiaomi Inc., is a Chinese designer and manufacturer of consumer electronics and related software, home appliances, and household hardware. It is the second-largest manufacturer of smartphones in the world, behind Samsung, most of which run on the MIUI User interface,  which is based on the Android operating system. The company is ranked 338th and is the youngest company on the Fortune Global 500.\nXiaomi was founded in 2010 in Beijing by now multi-billionaire Lei Jun when he was 40 years old, along with six senior associates. Lei had founded Kingsoft as well as Joyo.com, which he sold to Amazon for $75 million in 2004. In August 2011, Xiaomi released its first smartphone and, by 2014, it had the largest market share of smartphones sold in China. Initially the company only sold its products online; however, it later opened brick and mortar stores. By 2015, it was developing a wide range of consumer electronics. In 2020, the company sold 146.3 million smartphones and its MIUI mobile user interface has over 500 million monthly active users.  As of 2023, Xiaomi is the third-largest seller of smartphones worldwide, with a market share of about 12%, according to Counterpoint. Its presence led some people to call Xiaomi the \"Apple of China\". It has come up with its own range of wearable items.  It also is a major manufacturer of appliances including televisions, flashlights, unmanned aerial vehicles, and air purifiers using its Internet of things and Xiaomi Smart Home product ecosystems.  \nXiaomi keeps its prices close to its manufacturing costs and bill of materials costs by keeping most of its products in the market for 18 months, longer than most smartphone companies. The company also uses inventory optimization and flash sales to keep its inventory low.\n\n## History  \n### 2010–2013  \nOn 6 April 2010 Xiaomi was co-founded by Lei Jun and six others:  \n* Lin Bin (林斌), vice president of the Google China Institute of Engineering  \n* Zhou Guangping (周光平), senior director of the Motorola Beijing R&D center  \n* Liu De (刘德), department chair of the Department of Industrial Design at the University of Science and Technology Beijing  \n* Li Wanqiang (黎万强), general manager of Kingsoft Dictionary  \n* Huang Jiangji (黄江吉), principal development manager  \n* Hong Feng (洪峰), senior product manager for Google China  \nLei had founded Kingsoft as well as Joyo.com, which he sold to Amazon for $75 million in 2004.

Xiaomi sold 9.2 million units during the quarter. On 7 November 2017, Xiaomi commenced sales in Spain and western Europe.  \n### 2018–2021  \nA Xiaomi Store in Loulé, Portugal  \nIn April 2018, Xiaomi announced a smartphone gaming brand called Black Shark. It had 6GB of RAM coupled with Snapdragon 845 SoC, and was priced at $508, which was cheaper than its competitors.  \nOn 2 May 2018, Xiaomi announced the launch of Mi Music and Mi Video to offer \"value-added internet services\" in India.

It established a subsidiary, Xiaomi Japan, as parts of its effort to enter the Japanese smartphone market.  \nOn 17 January 2020, POCO India became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi with entry-level and mid-range devices, followed by its global counterpart on 24 November 2020.  \nIn March 2020, Xiaomi launched their first foldable phone, the Mi Mix Fold. Powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 with an 8.01-inch foldable AMOLED display when open and a 6.5-inch external display when folded. In March 2020, Xiaomi showcased its new 40W wireless charging solution, which was able to fully charge a smartphone with a 4,000mAh battery from flat in 40 minutes.  \nIn October 2020, Xiaomi became the third-largest smartphone maker in the world by shipment volume, shipping 46.2 million handsets in Q3 2020.  \nOn 30 March 2021, Xiaomi announced that it will invest US$10 billion in electric vehicles over the following ten years. On 31 March 2021, Xiaomi announced a new logo for the company, designed by Kenya Hara.  \nIn July 2021, Xiaomi became the second largest smartphone maker in the world, according to Canalys.

The phones are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset.  \n### Since 2022  \nIn April 2022, Xiaomi officially joined the Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC) board.  \nIn May 2022, the Indian court has lifted the $725 million freeze on Xiaomi by federal agencies.  \nIn June 2022, Xiaomi has established Zhuhai Xinshi Semiconductor Technology Co., Ltd., with a registered capital of 200 million RMB. The business scope includes: integrated circuit manufacturing, integrated circuit chip design and services, integrated circuit chip and product manufacturing, integrated circuit design, manufacturing of specialized equipment for semiconductor devices, manufacturing of semiconductor discrete devices, manufacturing of semiconductor lighting devices etc. The company is jointly held by Xiaomi's affiliated company Hubei Xiaomi Changjiang Industrial Fund Management  and others.  \nIn July 2022, Xiaomi and its sub-brand POCO combined held a 42% market share in the Russian smartphone market, ranking first.  \nOn 1 August 2022, Xiaomi India elevates COO Murali Krishnan B as president, responsible for the company's daily operations, services, public affairs, and strategic projects.

This position is up on their previous 3rd place ranking in 2019 for 111 industrial design registrations being published.  \nOn 8 February 2022, Lei released a statement on Weibo to announce plans for Xiaomi to enter the high-end smartphone market and surpass Apple as the top seller of premium smartphones in China in three years. To achieve that goal, Xiaomi will invest US$15.7 billion in R&D over the next five years, and the company will benchmark its products and user experience against Apple’s product lines. Lei described the new strategy as a \"life-or-death battle for our development\" in his Weibo post, after Xiaomi's market share in China contracted over consecutive quarters, from 17% to 14% between Q2 and Q3 2021, dipping further to 13.2% as of Q4 2021.  \nAccording to a recent report by Canalys, Xiaomi leads Indian smartphone sales in Q1. Xiaomi is one of the leaders of the smartphone makers in India which maintains device affordability.  \nIn 2022, Xiaomi announced and debuted the company's humanoid robot prototype to the public, while the current state of the robot is very limited in its abilities, the announcement was made to mark the companies ambitions to integrate AI into its product designs as well as develop their humanoid robot project into the future.  \n## Partnerships  \n<image>Xiaomi 12S Ultra featured a \"Leica Summicron 1:1.9-4.1 / 13-120 ASPH camera system\".\n\n\n### Xiaomi and Harman Kardon  \nIn 2021, Harman Kardon collaborated with Xiaomi for its newest smartphone; the Xiaomi Mi 11 series are the first smartphones to feature with Harman Kardon-tuned dual speaker setup.  \n### Xiaomi and Leica  \nIn 2022, Leica Camera entered a strategic partnership with Xiaomi to jointly develop Leica cameras to be used in Xiaomi flagship smartphones, succeeding the partnership between Huawei and Leica. The first flagship smartphones under this new partnership were the Xiaomi 12S Ultra and Xiaomi MIX Fold 2, launched in July and August 2022, respectively.  \n### Xiaomi Studios  \nIn 2021, Xiaomi began collaborating with directors to create short films shot entirely using the Xiaomi Mi 11 line of phones. In 2022, they made two shorts with Jessica Henwick. The first, Bus Girl won several awards and was long-listed for Best British Short at the 2023 BAFTA.  \n## Corporate identity  \n### Name etymology  \nXiaomi (小米) is the Chinese word for \"millet\". In 2011 its CEO Lei Jun suggested there are more meanings than just the \"millet and rice\". He linked the \"Xiao\" (小) part to the Buddhist concept that \"a single grain of rice of a Buddhist is as great as a mountain\", suggesting that Xiaomi wants to work from the little things, instead of starting by striving for perfection, while \"mi\" (米) is an acronym for Mobile Internet and also \"mission impossible\", referring to the obstacles encountered in starting the company. He also stated that he thinks the name is cute. In 2012 Lei Jun said that the name is about revolution and being able to bring innovation into a new area. Xiaomi's new \"Rifle\" processor has given weight to several sources linking the latter meaning to the Chinese Communist Party's \"millet and rifle\" (小米加步枪) revolutionary idiom during the Second Sino-Japanese War.  \n### Logo and mascot  \nA Mi-Home store with the new logo  \nXiaomi's first logo consisted of a single orange square with the letters \"MI\" in white located in the center of the square. This logo was in use until 31 March 2021, when a new logo, designed by well-known Japanese designer Kenya Hara, replaced the old one, consisting of the same basic structure as the previous logo, but the square was replaced with a \"squircle\" with rounded corners instead, with the letters \"MI\" remaining identical to the previous logo, along with a slightly darker hue.  \nXiaomi's mascot, Mitu, is a white rabbit wearing an Ushanka (known locally as a \"Lei Feng hat\" in China) with a red star and a red scarf around its neck. Later on, the red star on the hat was replaced by the company's logo.  \n## Reception  \n### Imitation of Apple Inc.  \nXiaomi has been accused of imitating Apple Inc. The hunger marketing strategy of Xiaomi was described as riding on the back of the \"cult of Apple\".  \nAfter reading a book about Steve Jobs in college, Xiaomi's chairman and CEO, Lei Jun, carefully cultivated a Steve Jobs image, including jeans, dark shirts, and Jobs' announcement style at Xiaomi's earlier product announcements. He was characterized as a \"counterfeit Jobs.\"  \nIn 2013, critics debated how many of Xiaomi's products were innovative, and how much of their innovation was just really good public relations.  \nOthers point out that while there are similarities to Apple, the ability to customize the software based upon user preferences through the use of Google's Android operating system sets Xiaomi apart. Xiaomi has also developed a much wider range of consumer products than Apple.  \n### Violation of GNU General Public License  \nIn January 2018, Xiaomi was criticized for its non-compliance with the terms of the GNU General Public License. The Android project's Linux kernel is licensed under the copyleft terms of the GPL, which requires Xiaomi to distribute the complete source code of the Android kernel and device trees for every Android device it distributes. By refusing to do so, or by unreasonably delaying these releases, Xiaomi is operating in violation of intellectual property law in China, as a WIPO state. Prominent Android developer Francisco Franco publicly criticized Xiaomi's behaviour after repeated delays in the release of kernel source code. Xiaomi in 2013 said that it would release the kernel code. The kernel source code was available on the GitHub website in 2020.  \n### Privacy concerns and data collection  \nAs a company based in China, Xiaomi is obligated to share data with the Chinese government under the China Internet Security Law and National Intelligence Law. There were reports that Xiaomi's Cloud messaging service sends some private data, including call logs and contact information, to Xiaomi servers. Xiaomi later released an MIUI update that made cloud messaging optional and that no private data was sent to Xiaomi servers if the cloud messaging service was turned off.  \nOn 23 October 2014, Xiaomi announced that it was setting up servers outside of China for international users, citing improved services and compliance to regulations in several countries.  \nOn 19 October 2014, the Indian Air Force issued a warning against Xiaomi phones, stating that they were a national threat as they sent user data to an agency of the Chinese government.  \nIn April 2019, researchers at Check Point found a security breach in Xiaomi phone apps. The security flaw was reported to be preinstalled.  \nOn 30 April 2020, Forbes reported that Xiaomi extensively tracks use of its browsers, including private browser activity, phone metadata and device navigation, and more alarmingly, without secure encryption or data anonymization, more invasively and to a greater extent than mainstream browsers. Xiaomi disputed the claims, while confirming that it did extensively collect browsing data, and saying that the data was not linked to any individuals and that users had consented to being tracked. Xiaomi posted a response stating that the collection of aggregated usage statistics data is used for internal analysis, and would not link any personally identifiable information to any of this data. However, after a  followup by Gabriel Cirlig, the writer of the report, Xiaomi added an option to completely stop the information leak when using its browser in incognito mode.  \n### Censorship  \nIn September 2021, amidst a political spat between China and Lithuania, the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence urged people to dispose the Chinese-made mobile phones and avoid buying new ones, after the National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania claimed that Xiaomi devices have built-in censorship capabilities that can be turned on remotely.  \nXiaomi denied the accusations, saying that it \"does not censor communications to or from its users\", and that they would be engaging a third-party to assess the allegations. They also stated that regarding data privacy, it was compliant with two frameworks for following Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), namely its ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management Standards and the ISO/IEC 27701 Privacy Information Management System.  \n## Legal actions  \n### State administration of radio, film and television issue  \nIn November 2012, Xiaomi's smart set-top box stopped working one week after the launch due to the company having run foul of China's National Radio and Television Administration. The regulatory issues were overcome in January 2013.  \n### Misleading sales figures  \nThe Taiwanese Fair Trade Commission investigated the flash sales and found that Xiaomi had sold fewer smartphones than advertised. Xiaomi claimed that the number of smartphones sold was 10,000 units each for the first two flash sales, and 8,000 units for the third one. However, FTC investigated the claims and found that Xiaomi sold 9,339 devices in the first flash sale, 9,492 units in the second one, and 7,389 for the third. It was found that during the first flash sale, Xiaomi had given 1,750 priority ‘F-codes’ to people who could place their orders without having to go through the flash sale, thus diminishing the stock that was publicly available. The FTC fined Xiaomi TWD.  \n### Shut down of Australia store  \nIn March 2014, Xiaomi Store Australia (an unrelated business) began selling Xiaomi mobile phones online in Australia through its website, XiaomiStore.com.au. However, Xiaomi soon \"requested\" that the store be shut down by 25 July 2014. On 7 August 2014, shortly after sales were halted, the website was taken down. An industry commentator described the action by Xiaomi to get the Australian website closed down as unprecedented, saying, \"I’ve never come across this. It would have to be a strategic move.\" At the time this left only one online vendor selling Xiaomi mobile phones into Australia, namely Yatango (formerly MobiCity), which was based in Hong Kong. This business closed in late 2015.  \n### Temporary ban in India due to patent infringement  \nOn 9 December 2014, the Delhi High Court granted an ex parte injunction that banned the import and sale of Xiaomi products in India. The injunction was issued in response to a complaint filed by Ericsson in connection with the infringement of its patent licensed under reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing. The injunction was applicable until 5 February 2015, the date on which the High Court was scheduled to summon both parties for a formal hearing of the case. On 16 December, the High Court granted permission to Xiaomi to sell its devices running on a Qualcomm-based processor until 8 January 2015. Xiaomi then held various sales on Flipkart, including one on 30 December 2014. Its flagship Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G phone sold out in six seconds. A judge extended the division bench's interim order, allowing Xiaomi to continue the sale of Qualcomm chipset-based handsets until March 2018.  \n### US sanctions due to ties with People's Liberation Army  \nIn January 2021, the United States government named Xiaomi as a company \"owned or controlled\" by the People's Liberation Army and thereby prohibited any American company or individual from investing in it. However, the investment ban was blocked by a US court ruling after Xiaomi filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, with the court expressing skepticism regarding the government's national security concerns. Xiaomi denied the allegations of military ties and stated that its products and services were of civilian and commercial use. In May 2021, Xiaomi reached an agreement with the Defense Department to remove the designation of the company as military-linked.  \n### Lawsuit by KPN alleging patent infringement  \nOn 19 January 2021, KPN, a Dutch landline and mobile telecommunications company, sued Xiaomi and others for patent infringement. KPN filed similar lawsuits against Samsung in 2014 and 2015 in a court in the US.  \n### Lawsuit by Wyze alleging invalid patent  \nIn July 2021, Xiaomi submitted a report to Amazon alleging that Wyze Labs had infringed upon its 2019 \"Autonomous Cleaning Device and Wind Path Structure of Same\" robot vacuum patent. On 15 July 2021, Wyze filed a lawsuit against Xiaomi in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, arguing that prior art exists and asking the court for a declaratory judgment that Xiaomi's 2019 robot vacuum patent is invalid.  \n### Asset seizure in India  \nIn April 2022, India's Enforcement Directorate seized assets from Xiaomi as part of an investigation into violations of foreign exchange laws. The asset seizure was subsequently put on hold by a court order, but later upheld.  \n## Overseas manufacturing  \n### Inaugural plant in Pakistan  \nXiaomi's mobile device manufacturing plant was inaugurated on 4 March 2022, to begin production in Pakistan. The plant was set up in conjunction with Select Technologies (Pvt) Limited, an Air Link fully owned subsidiary. The production plant is located in Lahore.  \nAs of July 2022, the future of the plant is uncertain due to the 2021–2023 global supply chain crisis.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true based on the provided images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

Several west Asian communities have also settled and become part of the diversity of coastal south west India. These include the Parsis, Bohras and Baghdadi Jews in the westernmost region, the Bene Israel along the South western region, the descendants of mediterranean traders along Coorg and Mangalore, the Jonakan Mappilas  along Malabar region, and the cochin jews and Syriac Nasranis along the southernmost region of South India. The Chola Empire established vast Tamil influence across South East Asian region  across Indonesia, Java, Bali and Sumatra. This brought South Indian Heritage to Cambodia, Indonesia and Bali where the Balinese Hindu traditions still thrives. This also lead to intermingling between coastal India and the south east Asia particularly in the South eastern Cholamandalam coastline along the Bay of Bengal.  \n### Heritage  \nThe linguistic diversity of Coastal India includes languages of the Dravidian language family including Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Tulu and Kannada; languages belonging to the western zone of Indo Iranian language families including Gujarati, Marathi, Konkani, languages belonging to the central zone of the Indo-Iranian language families including Urdu and Persian and languages belonging to the eastern zone of Indo Iranian language family including Odia and Bengali. The region also has speakers of Semitic languages like Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic. The common elements of the people of coastal India includes cuisine that consists of agrarian and coastal products and clothing that involves long flowing drapes with bare midriff for both men and women suited for humid and warm climate. Throughout coastal India women wear drapes called saree in various styles. In the western corner of the region the drapes are called as Dhoti for men.  and Chaniya choli for women, further southwards the drapes are called as lungi or mundu for men.  and veshti for women. Towards the southernmost tip of coastal south western India the social system of inheritance was once matrilineal. There are various festivals celebrated in the coastal states centered on deities.  \n## Tourism  \nThe tourism is enabled by numerous  \nislands, beaches and coral reefs in coastal India, full potential of which is yet to be exploited.  \n## Gallery\n\nQuestion: Which image shows a historical trade route involving ancient Coastal India?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Linke Wienzeile Buildings  \n<image>Majolica House by Otto Wagner (1898)\n\n<image>Medallion House by Otto Wagner\nThe Linke Wienzeile Buildings are two apartment buildings in Vienna constructed by Otto Wagner in 1898-99 in the Vienna Secession style. They are both lavishly decorated with colorful tiles, sculpture and wrought iron. One house,  at 40 Linke Wienzeile, has a facade covered with majolica, or glazed earthenware tiles in floral designs, is popularly known as the Majolica House.  The second, at 38 Linke Wienzeile, is called the Medallion House, for the bronze medallions on the facade.  It also features sculpted angels on the roof. A third building nearby, at 3 Köstlergasse, was the town residence of Wagner for a time.\n\n## History  \nAs Vienna was expanding rapidly around its edges, in 1893 Wagner proposed a project creating a new channel for the Wien river, a tributary of the Danube, and a grand boulevard with new buildings to line it. His project was accepted by the city government in 1894.  \nWagner was very critical of the historicism of the buildings which lined the Ringstrasse, the famous circular main boulevard of Vienna, which he termed a \"stylistic masked ball\". He presented his new ideas in an essay entitled Modern Architecture, published in 1896, calling for a new architecture whose forms expressed their functions. He had already designed several stations in the new style for the Vienna transit system. He now proposed two residential buildings in the new style.  \n### Majolica House, Linke Wienzeile 40 (1898-99)  \nThe most famous of these is the Majolikahaus or Majolica House, at Linke Wienzeile 40. Its facade is entirely covered with majolica, or colorful glazed earthenware tiles in the floral designs which characterized the early Vienna Secession. The facade decoration was made by his student de.   The facade was not only decorative, but had a practical purpose; the tile facade could be easily cleaned by using fire hoses.  \n### Medallion House, Linke Wienzeile 38 (1898-99)  \nThe other building, Linke Wienzeile 38, is known as Medallion House  because of its decor of gilded stucco medallions by Wagner's student and frequent collaborator, Koloman Moser.   The roof, visible from far away, features several sculpted heads, called The Criers, or The Crying Women by Othmar Schimkowitz.  He provided sculpture for other Vienna Secession landmarks including the three gorgons on the 1898 Secession Building by  Joseph Maria Olbrich, and for two other famous buildings by Hoffmann; the Kirche am Steinhof church in Vienna, and the rooftop sculpture of angels the Austrian Postal Savings Bank.  The sculptures and other ornaments were removed when the style was out of fashion, but recently it has been restored to its original appearance.  \nBoth buildings also feature very ornate wrought-iron decoration on the balconies and in the elevator cages and stairways in the interior, in keeping with the early Secession style.  \n### Wagner House, 3 Köstlergasse (1899)  \nWagner had his own town apartment in a third building he built close by, at 3 Köstlergasse.  It was completed in 1899, and had later renovations.   The white facade is very sober, in his later style, with almost no ornament.  The interior has more ornament, particularly in the curling railing of the stairwell.  \nHis apartment featured  decoration based on Japanese floral prints, and specially-designed furniture, but its most famous feature was the bathroom. A marble plaque on the wall supported the shower head, the sink was of marble on nickel legs, and the bathtub was of glass, mounted in a nickel frame. Wagner had the bathroom displayed at the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following descriptions best matches the architectural style depicted in both images?\nChoice list: \nA. Gothic Revival, characterized by pointed arches and intricate stonework\nB. Art Deco, known for its geometric patterns and bold use of metallics\nC.

He currently competes in the ARCA Racing Series, driving the No. 34 Chevrolet for Darrell Basham Racing.  \n## Racing career  \n### ARCA Racing Series  \n<image>Basham's 2013 ARCA car at Road America\nBasham made his ARCA Racing Series debut in 1972. In 1975, Basham posted a career-best finish of fifth twice, both times at Salem Speedway. One year later, he finished a career-best seventh place in the standings.  \nAfter driving sporadically over the next two decades, Basham began racing full-time again in 2002. The next season, Basham won the Spirit Award for his dedication and support for ARCA, uplifting spirit by way of example, perseverance, and positive attitude. He finished ninth in the 2009 Lucas Oil Slick Mist 200 at Daytona, tying his career-best finish at the track from 33 years earlier. That same year, Basham and his son Jason made ARCA history by becoming the first father/son duo to finish in the top 20 in the standings the same year.  \nIn 2011, Basham competed in all 19 races, having a best finish of 12th at Salem Speedway and finishing 10th in the season point standings. He also won the Spirit Award for the second time.  \nBasham made his 300th career ARCA start at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis in 2012, finishing 21st in the event. He had a best finish of 14th place that season at Winchester Speedway, and ultimately finished 11th in the points standings. He was awarded the Marcum Award at the Championship Awards Banquet for his positive efforts and contributions within the ARCA Racing community.\n<image>2018 ARCA car at Madison\nAfter racing a full schedule in the ARCA Racing Series for the previous 11 seasons, the 63-year-old Basham decided to reduce his schedule for the 2013 season and only compete on short tracks. Basham would run seventeen more races between 2014 and 2019. He did not make any starts for the next three years, but returned to the series for the 2023 season finale at Toledo, driving the No. 11 Ford for Fast Track Racing, where he would finish twelfth, albeit nineteen laps down to race winner William Sawalich.\n\n### NASCAR  \nBasham has competed in a single NASCAR Winston Cup Series event in his career, the 1979 Sun-Drop Music City USA 420 at Nashville Speedway in Nashville, Tennessee. He started and finished 24th in the 28-car field, completing 101 of the race's 420 laps before retiring from the event due to rear end failure. Basham also competed in the NASCAR-sanctioned Goody's Dash Series, a racing formula for four-cylinder subcompact cars, in the early and mid 1990s.  \n## Personal life  \nBasham has three children. His son Jason competed in 60 ARCA Racing Series events between 2003 and 2013.  \nBasham operates a business as an independent trucker, operating his shop and trucking business from shops attached to his home in Henryville; he builds his own racing engines as well. On March 2, 2012, Basham's race shop was destroyed by a tornado that devastated Henryville; Basham was able to salvage his race cars and other parts to reopen in a garage in Marysville, Indiana, and successfully resumed racing in ARCA, christening his car the Spirit of Henryville. He also has a son named Mike, who also has competed in ARCA, and a brother named Dugan, who worked as a crew chief for his Darrell's team.  \n## Motorsports career results  \n### NASCAR  \n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Manufactured by Lockheed, and under license by Canadair and a consortium of European companies which included Messerschmitt/MBB, Dornier, Fiat, Fokker and SABCA. The type featured strengthened fuselage and wing structure, increased internal fuel capacity, an enlarged vertical fin, strengthened landing gear with larger tires and revised flaps for improved combat maneuvering. Upgraded avionics included a new Autonetics NASARR F15A-41B radar with air-to-air and ground mapping modes, the Litton LN-3 Inertial Navigation System (the first on a production fighter) and an infrared sight.\n\n### RF-104G  \n189 tactical reconnaissance models based on F-104G, usually with three KS-67A cameras mounted in the forward fuselage in place of cannon.  \n### TF-104G  \n220 combat-capable trainer version of F-104G; no cannon or centerline pylon, reduced internal fuel. One aircraft used by Lockheed as a demonstrator with the civil registration number L104L, was flown by Jackie Cochran to set three women's world speed records in 1964. This aircraft later served in the Netherlands. A pair of two-seat TF-104Gs and a single-seat F-104G joined the Dryden inventory in June 1975.  \n## F-104H  \nProjected export version based on a F-104G with simplified equipment and optical gunsight.

Up to two Sparrow; and two, theoretically four or six, Sidewinder missiles were carried on all the hardpoints except the central (underbelly), or seven 340 kg (750 lb) bombs (normally, two-four 227–340 kg/500-750 lb). Range was up to 1,250 km (777 mi) with four tanks, ferry range 2,940 km (1,827 mi). Aircraft allocated to air defence missions had their 20 mm (.79 in) M-61 Vulcan cannon removed. The F-104S was cleared for a higher maximum takeoff weight, allowing it to carry up to 7,500 lb (3,400 kg) of stores; other Starfighters had a maximum external load of 4,000 lb (1,814 kg). With four under wing drop tanks range was up to 780 mi (1,250 km). Production of the F-104S totalled 286, with the Italian Air Force taking delivery of 246 and the Turkish Air Force receiving 40 aircraft.  \n### F-104S-ASA  \n(Aggiornamento Sistemi d'Arma – \"Weapon Systems Update\") – An upgraded F-104S, 147 were modified from existing airframes, with Fiat R21G/M1 radar with frequency hopping, look-down/shoot-down capability, new IFF and weapons delivery computer, and provision for AIM-9L all-aspect Sidewinder and Selenia Aspide missiles. Due to the delays of Aspide integration, the initial version, with Raytheon AIM-7 Sparrows was designated ASA-1. When the Aspide became available, all F-104Ss were upgraded to ASA-2 standard. First flown in 1985 the F-104S-ASA was principally an air-defence aircraft without enhancements to ground attack capabilities and were later modified to interceptor standards (CI) with removal of the 20 mm (.79 in) M-61 Vulcan cannon.  \n### F-104S-ASA/M  \n(Aggiornamento Sistemi d'Arma/Modificato – \"Weapon Systems Update/Modified\") – 49 F-104S-ASA and 15 two-seat TF-104G aircraft upgraded from 1998 to ASA/M standard with GPS, new TACAN and Litton LN-30A2 INS, refurbished airframe, and improved cockpit displays. All strike-related equipment was removed, including the IRST (the small unit known as 'IR-Sight', forward the windshield). The last Starfighters in combat service, the F-104S-ASA/M was withdrawn in October 2004 (the last unit being 10° Gruppo/9° Stormo, Grazzanise), and temporarily replaced by F-16 Fighting Falcons, whilst awaiting delivery of Eurofighter Typhoons.  \n## CF-104  \n200 Canadian-built versions, built under license by Canadair and optimized for both nuclear strike and 2-stage-to-orbit payload delivery, having NASARR R-24A radar with air-to-air modes, cannon deleted (restored after 1972), additional internal fuel cell, and Canadian J79-OEL-7 engines with 10,000 lbf (44 kN)/15,800 lbf (70 kN) thrust.  \n### CF-104D  \n38 dual-control trainer versions of CF-104, built by Lockheed, but with Canadian J79-OEL-7 engines.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Love Again (Dua Lipa song)  \n\"Love Again\" is a song by English and Albanian singer Dua Lipa from her second studio album, Future Nostalgia (2020). The song was written by Lipa alongside Clarence Coffee Jr., Chelcee Grimes and its producer Koz. They wrote the song based on the concept of manifesting positive things into one's life and Lipa later described it as her favourite song on the album. It was sent for radio airplay in France on 11 March 2021 as the sixth and final single from Future Nostalgia before being released for digital download and streaming on 4 June globally. It is a classic-sounding dance-pop, disco and electropop song with a 21st century nu-disco production that includes disco beats and 1970s-styled disco strings. The song samples \"My Woman\" by Al Bowlly with Lew Stone and His Monseigneur Band, using it for several aspects, thus Bing Crosby, Max Wartell and Irving Wallman are also credited as writers. The lyrics explore themes of heartbreak and personal growth, seeing Lipa falling in love again with a new lover following a rough split.  \nSeveral music critics praised the use of the \"My Woman\" sample as well as the strings used in the production and the lyrics. Commercially, \"Love Again\" reached reached number 51 on the UK Singles Chart and number 41 on the US Billboard Hot 100 as well as number 59 on the Billboard Global 200 chart. It additionally reached the top 10 of charts in Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, reaching the summit in the last of the territories. The song has been certified silver in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and platinum in both Italy and Poland by the Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana (FIMI) and Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV), respectively.  \nThe music video for \"Love Again\" was directed by Lope Serrano and filmed at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London. The visual sees Lipa and her rodeo clown-styled dancers in the hotel's ballroom line dancing, riding mechanical bulls that sometimes disappear and painting eggs. A horse appears and the rodeo clowns attempt to capture a giant egg. The hats featured prominently in the music video were made by milliner Gladys Tamez. Several critics commended the video's message of it being silly to fall in love so soon, as well as its Western style and surrealism. Lipa performed the song on multiple occasions in 2021, including at the Time 100 event, at the 41st Brit Awards as part of a Future Nostalgia Medley and at the iHeartRadio Music Festival. The song was included on the setlist of Lipa's 2022 Future Nostalgia Tour. It was further promoted with remixes by Horse Meat Disco, Imanbek and Garabatto.  \n## Writing and production  \n\"Love Again\" was written by Lipa and her longtime collaborators Clarence Coffee Jr., Chelcee Grimes and Stephen Kozmeniuk, the latter of whom also handled the production. They began working on the song while Lipa was going through a rough patch with a breakup. She had been in a relationship with someone who was dishonest to her and realised it was no longer healthy for her. During the relationship, Lipa failed to recognise herself and felt as though she had lost her power, as she usually sees herself as a strong woman. The collaborators had been working together in the studio for a couple days, but had not written anything they liked. Lipa was running late to the studio that day, while Kozmeniuk came in early determined to make something cool. With her album Future Nostalgia, Lipa wanted to create \"old-styled\" music with a modern twist, being inspired by artists that she grew up listening to. Having known that, Kozmeniuk played with some analog synths and came up with a rudimentary chord progression. He then added a guitar riff on top and a drum break throughout the song. Acoustic guitars were then added. When Lipa arrived at the studio, Grimes and Coffee were playing the guitar and singing \"Hotdamn, you got me in love again\". Lipa quickly rejected the line and changed it to \"Goddamn, you got me in love again\". She began expressing her feelings about the relationship to the writers, and Coffee suggested writing about that. They decided to begin the song with a concept of manifesting positive energy into one's life and realizing some things need to end. Lipa thought that if she wrote about this, she might feel better. They started writing \"Love Again\" on a guitar and the song was originally in a non-standard song structure, which Lipa was fine with. Lipa thought the version felt good.  \nFollowing the session, Kozmeniuk was reading a Studio 54 book and he was picturing the work of Donna Summer where she had built up with a lot of a drums and string parts in an intro, before the song began. Inspired by this, he got his neighbour Drew Jurecka to play the violin and strings. Kozmeniuk quickly sent the string version to Lipa, which she admired for how dramatic it was. However, all the collaborators agreed that the song was still missing something. Later, two beats were added to the middle eight to build for a string part before exploding with the chorus. One night while they were all in a studio, Coffee began singing the riff of the 1932 track \"My Woman\" by Al Bowlly with Lew Stone and His Monseigneur Band over the top of what they had. Lipa thought the riff was from Star Wars (1977), while Grimes thought it was eerie and spooky. Lipa then suggested that they should incorporate it into \"Love Again\". Kozmeniuk spent a lot of time doing so with several different pitch corrections as \"Love Again\" and \"My Woman\" were in different keys. Due to this, Bing Crosby, Max Wartell and Irving Wallman were credited as writers. Coffee and Grimes questioned Lipa on including the line \"I'll sink my teeth in disbelief\" but Lipa fought really hard for it. She described the line as a visual one where you can almost taste how good something is, like the rush of adrenaline when she is about to get on stage. The singer later described this as her favourite line she has ever written. The line was originally \"don't wake me up if it's a dream\".  \nLipa's vocals were recorded at RAK Studios in London. She went to the studio with her vocal producer Lorna Blackwood. Blackwood told Lipa to sing the sad parts of the song with a smile. Lipa recorded the ad-libs last, nervously thinking she would go off pitch. However, the nerves went away as the booth is like a school bathroom with strong acoustics where anything sounds great. Other vocals were recorded at TaP Studio and Sleeper Sound, both in London. The song was recorded at the latter of the two studios as well as Windmill in Norfolk and Modulator Music in Toronto. Mixing was handled by Matty Green at Studio 55 in Los Angeles while Chris Gehringer mastered the song at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey. Lipa described \"Love Again\" as \"dance crying\" as it is a dance song with the juxtaposition of both happy and sad feelings. As the song was written in parts instead of a complete track, there were several different versions of it. At one point Lipa suggested making the current middle eight the chorus, but quickly went with the demo version. After the song was finished, the collaborators spent a lot of time getting the structure right and playing with the arrangements, right up until the final mix. Lipa described \"Love Again\" as her favourite song on Future Nostalgia.  \n## Music and lyrics  \nMusically, \"Love Again\" is a dance-pop, disco and electropop song with a classic sound. The song has a length of 4:18, and a structure of verse, bridge, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, bridge, middle eight, bridge, chorus. It is composed in the time signature of 4 time and the key of F-sharp minor|Fsharp minor, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute and a chord progression of Fsharpm–D–Bm7–E. The song's melodramatic 21st-century nu-disco production matches its lyrics, and includes gloopy violins, orchestral sounds as well as disco beats and synths. Swooning, stirring and buzzing 1970s disco strings are also included, which add an emotional edge to the lyrics. The song samples \"My Woman\" (1932) by Al Bowlly with Lew Stone and His Monseigneur Band. These elements are featured in the intro and woven in and out throughout the song. This sample includes its strings, horn and trumpet, the latter of which was made popular by its sample in White Town's 1997 song \"Your Woman\". Acoustic guitar strums are included in the echoing bridge, before a repetitive hook and a thudding beat drop.  \nLipa uses her lower register husky vocals that encapsulate an undeniable sense of urgency, as if she is mimicking the rush of falling in love with hints of tension ever so often. Her vocals range from the low note of E3 to the high note of A4. Lyrically, \"Love Again\" explores themes of heartbreak and personal growth with proclamations of rediscovered love and the hateful romantic rediscovering of the power of love. Lipa expresses her powerlessness in a new relationship and explains how terrifying it can be. Having fallen out with the belief in love, she navigates her feelings after being unexpectedly swept off her feet by a new partner following a rough split with a previous lover. She knows how a new love could end, but is faithful and open to what the future might bring. The song quotes the chorus melody of \"Don't Cha\" (2005) by the Pussycat Dolls. Lipa additionally described it as one manifesting good things into their life when things are not going their way.  \n## Release and promotion  \n\"Love Again\" was released through Warner Records on 27 March 2020 as the eighth track on Lipa's second studio album Future Nostalgia. A lyric video for it was released on 9 April 2020. A remix of the song by Horse Meat Disco is a part of Lipa and the Blessed Madonna's 28 August 2020-released, DJ Mix-crafted remix album Club Future Nostalgia, while the original version of the remix was released for digital download and streaming on 11 September 2020. It is a 1980s-styled, percussion and synth-heavy remix that introduces simple melodies, funk-laced instrumentals and strutting beats with a retro charm; although, the \"My Woman\" sample is no longer heard. The song was the subject of a 15 December 2020-released Song Exploder volume 2 episode on Netflix in which Lipa and her collaborators talk about the making of the song.  \n\"Love Again\" was promoted to radios in France on 11 March 2021 as the sixth single from Future Nostalgia. The song was released for digital download and streaming globally on 4 June. Nina Braca of Billboard noted that this release, after 15 months following the release of the album, was \"practically unheard of\" in modern music era as \"album cycles often come and go in as little as a few weeks\". The song was sent for radio airplay in Italy on 11 June 2021. On 22 June 2021, it was promoted to contemporary hit, adult contemporary and dance radio stations in the United States as a promotional single. The song was officially sent as a single to contemporary hit radio stations in the country on 6 July and adult contemporary radio stations on 26 July 2021. It was promoted with two more remixes: the 1 October 2021-released Imanbek remix and the 15 October-released Garabatto remix.  \n## Reception  \nElly Watson of DIY praised the use of the \"My Woman\" sample as \"goosebump-inducing,\" while MusicOMHs Nick Smith stated it has a \"slapping effect.\" Smith went on to call the song a \"highlight\" and compared it to Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). The Independents Helen Brown thought that the song has Lipa's best use of a sample with \"My Woman\". She also questioned if it is Lipa's \"most romantic song\" to date, while David Levesley's GQ review saw him calling the song her \"most powerfully pro-love song to date\". Jonathan Wright of God Is in the TV commended the \"excellent\" use of the \"My Woman\" sample, as well as complimenting the string arrangement and middle eight. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters commended the \"clever\" use of the \"My Woman\" sample, stating it makes the song \"stand out.\" In a separate, negative review from the same publication, Nick Malone stated that the hook doesn't \"pop\" the way it needs to, Lipa's vocals are \"non-committal\" and the \"My Woman\" sample does not make it \"soar\".  \nWriting for Stereogum, Chris DeVille found the song to be reminiscent of Vicki Sue Robinson's \"Turn the Beat Around\" (1976), while Jeffrey Davies' review for Spectrum Culture saw him compare it to \"I Feel Love\" (1977) by Donna Summer. Nylon writer Steffanee Wang viewed the song as a \"Western movie's take on the feverish emotion\" of love. In her review for The Guardian, Laura Snapes complimented Lipa for being awestruck in the song. Mike Nied of Idolator commended Lipa's \"dulcet\" vocals, stating they work well for this song. He continued by noting its contrast to her single \"Don't Start Now\" (2019) as well as viewing \"Love Again\" as a vulnerable moment. For Business Insider, Callie Ahlgrim thought that Lipa's vocals \"shine\" on the track, while also calling it \"cinematic.\"  \nSlant Magazine ranked \"Love Again\" as 2020's 25th best song and writer Sal Cinquemani praised it for demonstrating \"Lipa's knack for wringing pathos from everyday dating woes and pouring it into sublime dance-pop.\" He additionally viewed the song as \"euphoric\" and a \"dizzying dance-floor filler.\" For Crack, Michael Cragg thought that the song is a \"sky-scraping ballad\" that transforms into a \"sophisticated, dancefloor-ready bop\". From her review in Billboard, Bianca Gracie saw that the use of strings adds a \"jolt of nostalgia\", while the lyrics see Lipa in an \"out-of-body love experience\". Overall, she named it Future Nostalgias sixth best track and one of the album's sultrier moments. In April 2020, Christopher Rosa of Glamour ranked it as Lipa's sixth best song, viewing it as the album's most \"overtly disco\" track and \"grandiose ode to falling in love against your better wishes\".  \n## Commercial performance  \nUpon Future Nostalgias release, \"Love Again\" became a relatively successful album track across Europe. The song reached number 38 in Lithuania, 107 in Portugal, 86 in Romania, 62 in Slovakia and 90 in Spain. It additionally entered at number 61 on both the UK Singles Downloads Chart and UK Audio Streaming Chart. In April 2020, the Official Charts Company reported that the song was the most downloaded album track from the album in the United Kingdom. Following its release as a single, \"Love Again\" debuted at number 159 on the Billboard Global 200 chart dated 19 June 2021.

On France's SNEP Singles Chart, the song debuted at number 198 on the issue dated 10 April 2021, before peaking at number 41 two months later and charting for 37 weeks.  \nIn the UK, \"Love Again\" debuted at number 96 on the UK Singles Chart dated 18 June 2021. It departed the chart the following week but re-entered at number 92 on the chart dated 23 July 2021.

In October 2021, it peaked at number 41 and spent 16 weeks charting. The song additionally peaked at number 60 on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart and number 3 on the NZ Hot Singles Chart.  \n## Music video  \n### Background and release  \nThe music video for \"Love Again\" was directed by Lope Serrano of Spanish production team Canada. Lipa contacted the production company for another collaboration following the video for her 2020 single \"Physical\". They were briefed with information that Lipa pictured herself on a mechanical bull for the video, it was her favourite song on the album and that the song was about a personal resurgence, not necessarily just in a romantic context. When writing the video, Serrano attempted to gather real and predictable rodeo elements and combine them in unexpected ways. The production team found new meanings of the rodeo elements to communicate in the video, including using the clown makeup for abstract painting strains so classical paintings could be used to connect shots. They used paintings that depicted horses, romantic raptures, hugs, portraits and hyperdynamic group compositions. Serrano decided to add egg aspects to the video as he was looking for \"an unexpected rhyme to the lasso routine\". He thought that the wrist movement when one beats eggs is similar to a lasso movement. He also wanted to illustrate the song's romantic message, like the idea of a love coming up again that seems like a once in a lifetime experience that is pure, intense and unexpected, which he compared to \"like these delicate flowers or animals that are just designed to blossom and intercourse just once and then they die\" as well as the \"tense connection between the humans and their recovered feelings\".  \n<image>The music video for \"Love Again\" was filmed at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London.\nThe visual was filmed at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London about three weeks before its release, during rehearsals for Lipa's performance at the 41st Brit Awards. Serrano liked the idea of shooting in one place as it adds to the video's cohesiveness and makes it as though the characters are real and belong to the setting. The video's team quarantined in the hotel for a week before they began filming due to restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This gave the team time to work in the location. Lipa learned the video's choreography in 45 minutes and new outfits were added for her in the midst of filming. Serrano recalled she enjoyed being on the mechanical bull that was controlled. Steve Dent helped the team with the horse and production company Eighty4 helped with the VFX, making it so that when the horse went invisible, there was still a 3D aspect with the saddle and rider. These shots were the hardest to shoot so the team worked with the tension of the ropes attached to the horse's neck as well as adjusting its natural shadow.  \nLipa formally announced the video on 31 May 2021. It premiered via YouTube on 4 June 2021. A director's cut version of the video was released on 28 July 2021. This version opens with two rodeo clowns reading a script, which is the lyrics of \"Love Again\", more classical paintings in the editing, less dancing, more shots of the clowns, a chicken on the TV set, Lipa riding the lighting horse as well as final credits that feature a rodeo clown riding the horse which has a green suit on.\n\n### Analysis and synopsis  \nThe video opens with two title cards saying Lipa's name and the song title, \"Love Again\". Simultaneously, a Stetson cowboy hat floats from a coat room to a ballroom where Lipa catches it and puts it on her head. She wears a zebra print bikini top, belted black denim shorts, a suede vest, a cowboy hat, a bolo tie and chunky heeled boots while riding a mechanical bull; this bull later becomes invisible as a way to make things less emphatic and literal. Intercut scenes of Lipa riding the bull covered in miniature light bulbs and wearing a Phipps cowboy suit containing a green top, blue pants and a cowboy hat, also covered in miniature light bulbs, are also included, as well as her floating in slow motion while wearing Blumarine pink bandana crop top with a lacy trim, a lavender hat, a butterfly belt buckle with diamantés, blue denim pants and pink cowboy boots. She later waves a glowing lasso in the former scene. The singer is also seen cracking eggs with different coloured yolks to later whisk them in the same bowl while rodeo clowns crack them too and paint clown faces on each other with the coloured yolks as well as making omelettes. She wears a red-and-black denim set from a collaboration between Levi and Miu Miu with a leather jacket from the latter company's 2011 line.  \nBack in the ballroom, Lipa square dances and line dances with rodeo clowns as the floor is covered in eggs. She wears Rick Owens grill kiss leather boots, camouflage green cargo pants, a longline brown cow print jacket and a cow-print bra; the latter three clothing items are from The Attico. Some of the rodeo clowns also appear on invisible horses. Further on, a giant egg floats in the middle of the ballroom and the rodeo clowns attempt to capture it with lassos. The egg is eventually too much for them as it pulls them onto the floor before also becoming invisible. A horse covered in LEDs then runs in around the hallways. The \"wild\" horse scene is a metaphor for the idea of love, not being completely clear, while the egg scene adds to the metaphor by enhancing the people in the relationship with the cowboys, ropes and horse. Also, the floating egg being captured, tensioning its delicacy, is a metaphor for the myth of female reproduction and how weak male human violence can be. The video closes with Lipa dressed as a rodeo clown, slow dancing with an anonymous person; they both wear all white. Lipa wears a red nose and wipes some of her lipstick of the same colour onto her partner's jacket.  \n### Reception  \nMaia Kedem of Audacy hypothesised that Lipa wearing the clown makeup at the end may be a metaphor for \"the clownery of falling back in love after experiencing heartbreak\", while calling the metaphor \"deep\". Hot Presss Ciaran Brennan viewed Lipa's style in the video as \"cowboy chic\". In Refinery29, Eliza Huber said that although Western tropes in fashion have been popular for a while, Lipa makes the style \"feel surprisingly fresh\" in the video, while also comparing it to the clip for Madonna's \"Don't Tell Me\" (2000). Wang compared the hotel ballroom setting to The Shining (1980) while theorizing that the video documents the cast's \"slow descent into insanity\", \"putting on clown makeup to also hoedown in the building’s empty ballroom\". For Grazia, Marisa Petrarca called the video \"absolute gold\" with Lipa embracing a \"glamorous take on Western fashion\" containing \"epic\" ensembles. Business Insider used the video as an example on how Stetson cowboy hats have changed demography in their \"So Expensive\" web series.  \nFor Vulture, Devon Ivie labeled the music video a \"surrealist country-inspired video\" that \"has us falling in love with Lipa all over again\". The staff of Wonderland said their minds \"are totally blown\" with the video, while calling the fashion \"gorgeous\" and the choreography \"a TikTok worthy dance routine\". In The A.V. Club, Gabrielle Sanchez noted science fiction elements in the video with the invisible mechanical bull. Similarly, Erica Gonzales of Harper's Bazaar thought these elements are more \"surreal\", while also stating that the clown makeup is the best part of the video and thought that it poked fun at the \"clownery\" of falling in love knowing it could end badly. In a review from Billboard, Gil Kaufman said that Lipa gets her \"urban cowgal on\" in the visual and thought she took a \"sensual, slow-mo ride\" on the mechanical bull.  \nCinquemani thought that the main takeaway from the video was \"keep falling for the wrong person and the yolk's on you\" while noting its use of special effects and praising the surreality. He went on to note that Lipa's \"disco-cowgirl getup and choreography\" was similar to that of \"Don't Tell Me\" and Halsey's \"You Should Be Sad\" (2020). The staff of Contactmusic.com said that Lipa looks like a \"super-sexy Jessie Cowgirl\" and praised her \"natural born\" bull-riding skills. They also said that the video gives the song \"a whole new lease of life\". For Consequence, Wren Graves named the video a \"campy rodeo fantasy\", while commending how Lipa waves her lasso, similarly to Wonder Woman. Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! stated that with the video, Lipa proves that \"country and western dressup is a trend that will simply not die\". \"Love Again\" won Best Pop Video at the 2021 UK Music Video Awards.  \n## Live performances  \n<image>Lipa performing \"Love Again\" on the Future Nostalgia Tour in 2022\nLipa performed \"Love Again\" during her NPR Tiny Desk Concert, released 4 December 2020. Lipa described the performance as a \"special\" rendition of the song and the concert was filmed in London instead of Washington, D.C. where the concerts normally take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She was accompanied by backup singers, a bassist, a guitarist and a drum machine. On 19 February 2021, the singer performed a stripped-down acoustic version of the track during the 2021 Time 100 event along with her 2020 single \"Levitating\". Lipa performed the soft piano rendition of the song as a duet with Elton John at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party on 25 April 2021. She performed the song at the 41st Brit Awards as part of her set list of a Future Nostalgia Medley on 11 May 2021. The singer performed it at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Festival on 17 September. The song was included on the setlist of Lipa's 2022 Future Nostalgia Tour.\n\n## Track listings  \n* Digital download and streaming – Horse Meat Disco remix  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Horse Meat Disco remix) – 5:31  \n* Radio airplay – French radio edit  \n-  \"Love Again\" – 2:35  \n* Digital download and streaming  \n-  \"Love Again\" – 4:18  \n* Contemporary hit and adult contemporary radio – radio edit  \n-  \"Love Again\" – 3:53  \n* Digital download and streaming – Imanbek remix  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Imanbek remix) – 3:34  \n* Streaming – Imanbek remix – Spotify single  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Imanbek remix) – 3:34  \n-  \"Love Again\" – 4:18  \n* Digital download and streaming – Garabatto remix  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Garabatto remix) – 3:29  \n* Streaming – Garabatto remix – Spotify single  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Garabatto remix) – 3:29  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Imanbek remix) – 3:34  \n-  \"Love Again\" – 4:18  \n## Personnel  \n* Dua Lipa vocals  \n* Koz production, bass, drums, guitar, synthesizer  \n* Stuart Price additional production, bass guitar, keyboards  \n* Clarence Coffee Jr. backing vocals  \n* Alma Goodman backing vocals  \n* Vanessa Luciano backing vocals  \n* Chelcee Grimes backing vocalsnotetag|In the liner notes of Future Nostalgia: The Moonlight Edition, only Clarence Coffee Jr., Alma Goodman and Vanessa Luciano are credited as backing vocalists on \"Love Again\".

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Richard Ottley  \nSir Richard Ottley (5 August 1626 – 10 August 1670) was an English Royalist politician and soldier who served as a youth in the English Civil War in Shropshire. After the Restoration he played a prominent part in the repression of Parliamentarians and Nonconformists and was MP for Shropshire in the Cavalier Parliament.  \n## Background, early life and education  \nRichard Otley pictured, aged ten, with his parents, Sir Francis and Lucy Ottley, and his sister, Mary. An engraving made c.1825 after an oil painting of 1636 by Petrus Troueil, now owned by the Shrewsbury Museums Service.  \nPitchford Hall, Shropshire, home of the Royalist Ottley family in the 17th century. Pictured in 1901  \nPitchford Hall, photographed 2005.  \nRichard Ottley was the eldest son of  \n* Sir Francis Ottley of Pitchford, Shropshire, who was military governor of Shrewsbury for part of the English Civil War  \n* Lucy Edwards, daughter of Thomas Edwards of the College, Shrewsbury. She was the widow of Thomas Pope, another Shrewsbury resident.  \nThe Ottley family were part of the landed gentry of Shropshire and claimed descent from the more ancient Ottleys of Oteley, near Ellesmere, Shropshire. However, Thomas Ottley, the ancestor who bought Pitchford Hall in 1473, was a Merchant of the Staple with a house in Calais as well as in Shrewsbury. The Ottleys of Pitchford owed their status to wealth made as merchants of the thriving county town, with its monopoly in the finishing of Welsh cloth.  \nRichard Ottley was born on 5 August 1626 and christened on 15 September. He had a brother, Adam, who was born in 1628 and a sister, Mary, who was born in 1630. He was admitted to Shrewsbury School on 9 April 1638, the same day as his brother Adam. but his education beyond that stage was interrupted by the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642.  \n## The Civil War and Commonwealth  \nFrancis Ottley was quick to act to disrupt Parliamentary mobilization in Shropshire as Civil War threatened in the summer of 1642 and was instrumental in preparing the king's move from Nottingham to Shrewsbury in September, when the king knighted him. Richard Ottley, who was commissioned a captain in the royalist army, served under his father in the Shrewsbury garrison. Sir Francis held the town after the king's departure and was formally appointed as military governor in January 1643. He was removed by Prince Rupert in the summer of 1644. Sir Francis was captured by Parliamentarian forces in February 1645 on the eve of the fall of Shrewsbury, although later released.  \nRichard was present at the siege of Bridgnorth in 1646 and was covered by the surrender agreement negotiated by his father, which allowed the Royalist garrison to choose between peace and exile. The agreement explicitly granted permission to Lady Ottley and her children to live at Pitchford. The estates of both Sir Francis and Lady Ottley had been sequestrated by Parliament. Lady Ottley used the good offices of a friend and relative, Elinor Davenport, in contacting the sequestrators over furnishings and clothing. and employed Thomas Lee, a relative of Sir Francis and a Lincoln's Inn lawyer, to negotiate recovery of her own estates. On 16 June 1646 Richard was given a pass to travel to Shrewsbury to speak to Parliament's County Committee, probably in connection with his father's request to compound for delinquency, which was made on that date. A decision on the allowance for Lady Ottley and the children was soon made: a fifth of Sir Francis's estates was handed over to them for their maintenance by an order of 5 September 1646. However, the outstanding issues took three years to resolve.  \nGoldsmith's Hall.  \nFrontispiece to Eikon Basilike.  \nRichard Ottley spent a considerable part of this time in London with his father, often having to attend Goldsmiths' Hall, where the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents was housed. On 12 January he wrote to his mother from Gray's Inn to report that his father had obtained permission to live at home and that his personal property had been secured while he compounded. He thanked her for a pie. Richard was admitted to Gray's Inn for legal training on 1 March 1647. In April Lady Ottley wrote to him to report that Sir Francis had not actually gone home as there was a possibility he would be prosecuted by Humphrey Mackworth, who, although reckoned a cousin, was the Parliamentarian governor of Shrewsbury. Later in the year, on 2 August, Richard's younger brother Adam was also admitted to Gray's Inn.  \nAdam wrote to Lady Ottley in September 1648 in anticipation of Richard's engagement to Lady Lettice Ridgeway, \"soe good a sister in ye place of yt deare one w'ch I soe lately lost.\" The marriage probably took place in January 1649: their first child was born on October. On 24 March Sir Francis, with his last extant letter, sent Lettice a copy of Eikon Basilike, purportedly a collection of Charles I's final meditations and apologia: the same book had recently been sent by Adam Ottley to his mother. The Ottleys were clearly finding resources to sustain their royalist faith.  \nOn 13 April 1649 Sir Francis asked for Richard to be included in his composition. A reduced fine of £1860 was announced on the very next day. In recognition that the estates were encumbered by about £4,000 of debts, a further reduction of £660 was ordered on 25 June 1649, leaving a fine of £1200 to pay. Sir Francis survived only a few months, dying on 11 September, and leaving Richard as his heir. On 9 March 1650 Richard Ottley took the oath of loyalty before two Middlesex justices of the peace to the Commonwealth, \"as it is now established, without a King or House of Lords.\" This was necessary to gain permission to travel, as recusants and delinquents needed a pass from their county committee to travel more than five miles from home. With permission from the Parliamentary committees in Shropshire and Staffordshire, he was able to travel to the Midlands, settle his affairs and regain his estates. In July he obtained a pass to journey into Wales and to Oswestry on business, and in September he travelled to Yoxall to visit his wife's grandmother in Staffordshire. Lettice Ottley was by this time pregnant with their second child, as one of her great aunts, Cassandra Willoughby of Wollaton Hall noted shortly afterwards in a letter.  \nThe end of the year brought prospects of Ottley's completion of his business with the Commissioners for Compounding. On 20 December he was told that he owed £296 and could discharge this in two equal instalments at fortnightly intervals. However, the sum seems to have been wrongly transcribed, for the next communication from the commissioners, dated 17 January, refers to a debt of £269. Ottley had already promptly paid £134 10s. The commissioners had reviewed his debts and told him that they required only another £35 10s. This he paid immediately and on 24 January 1651 all seizures, sequestrations and penalties on the Ottley estates were discharged.  \nOttley seems thereafter to have been mainly quiescent during the rule of Oliver Cromwell. He took no part in the Penruddock uprising of 1655, although he probably alluded to it in a letter of May 1655, sent from his Inn of Court, where he stayed when in London. However, later that year he was faced by a large claim for compensation from a Mary Moloy, widow of Hugh Lewis, a London goldsmith. In a letter to Ottley, Humphrey Mackworth, the son and successor of the earlier governor, alleged that Sir Francis Ottley had confiscated from Lewis jewellery to the value of £600 during the Civil War. When she later sued him, Sir Francis had offered £300. Mackworth recommended that Ottley pay up, as Cromwell was exasperated by royalists because of the recent rising. Apparently Ottley decided to wait on events and Moloy's petition to Cromwell portrayed her as the daughter of a hero of the Nine Years' War in Ireland who had taken refuge in England during the Civil War. Now having four small children to feed, she had in turn sued Sir Francis and asked his heir for recompense. On 13 October Cromwell referred the matter to Mackworth, who was authorised to summon and question Richard Ottley. The matter seems to have been resolved the following month by Ottley paying Moloy the much smaller sum of £60.  \nOttley witnessed the funeral of Cromwell in November 1658 and wrote from Gray's Inn to inform his mother, enclosing a printed description. The Protectorate fell apart during the succeeding year. On 25 November 1659, a day after General Monck took overall command of the army, Richard and Adam Ottley were given a pass by Charles Fleetwood allowing them to travel between London and Pitchford without further hindrance: the regime had ceased to wield effective authority and had given up the attempt to control its enemies.  \n## Restoration and repression  \n<image>Francis Lord Newport, the Lord Lieutenant, was responsible for purging Calvinists from public office after the Restoration. He later suffered a similar fate himself for his opposition to the succession of James II.\n\n<image>Thomas Jones, the town clerk of Shrewsbury. A Presbyterian who had remained in the town when it was under royalist military occupation during the Civil War, Jones was nonetheless seen as a threat by Newport and Ottley who went to considerable lengths to remove him. This did not impede his later career and he went on to become Chief Justice of the Common Pleas under James II.\nAfter General Monck's intervention against the remaining Commonwealth forces, at the beginning of 1660, Richard Ottley came back into public life and began to take part in local government. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Shropshire in March 1660. There are no records for 1660 but he and Adam, his brother, are recorded as sitting on the bench at the January quarter sessions of 1660/61. Thereafter he does not appear in the record again until July 1662 and his attendance thereafter seems to have been sporadic.  \nOttley contacted Charles II and on 5 March Charles issued a commission from Brussels, appointing Ottley, his friend Richard Scriven and others as commissioners for Shropshire. They were authorised to raise a large militia force for the king's cause, to set up a command structure and to levy contributions for its support. Shrewsbury was still held by the stalwart Parliamentarian Colonel Thomas Hunt, who carried out a review of military resources and preparedness during April and arranged a muster of his forces for 1 May. However events were moving too quickly for Hunt's measures to take effect. The Convention Parliament accepted Charles II as king on 8 May. Ottley set off for Dover to welcome Charles to England in May. Charles entered London on 29 May and Ottley wrote from there to his mother:  \n\"My most deare and evere honored Mother,  \n\"I prayse God we are safe come to towne, and his Matie, with his two brotheres, the duke of Yorke and duke of Glouster, are now at Whitehall. I met them at Canterbury, and had the happinesse to be of the life guard since Fryday last; wherein my content over ballanced the paynes I underwent. I most, humbly thanke yor Lap for your py which I shiall enquire after. I beg pardon that I am soe short in wrighting, being weary at p'sent: I humbly crave yor blessing: wth my duty and thanks for yor goodnesse to mine, for whom my hearty prayers to God are : I rest  \n\"Yor Laps most dutiful sonne and servant,  \n\"May 29, Ric. Ottley.\"  \nShortly after the king's return, Ottley was knighted. On 19 June Ottley and Scriven issued a document at Shrewsbury that effectively annexed the resources promised to Hunt's militia to their own force, ending the dual military authority that had existed formally to that point. On 16 July a letter was issued by command of Charles II urging the Mayor of Shrewsbury to appoint Adam Ottley as town clerk. However, then position then was not, as the king had been informed, vacant: the post had been filled during the Commonwealth by Thomas Jones, who was to prove a resourceful opponent to the new dispensation.  \nOn 26 July Francis Lord Newport of High Ercall was commissioned Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire with wide-ranging powers. Ottley was made his Deputy Lieutenant on 3 September. The following month Newport appointed him captain of a cavalry troop in the county militia.  \nRepression of the old Parliamentarians began with claims that some had taken property from High Ercall and other places. Their houses were ransacked, resulting in a petition of protest from Thomas Hunt, an alderman of Shrewsbury, to the House of Commons, alleging he had lost goods to the value of £1377 18s. 9d. Edmund Waring, a former Parliamentarian governor of Shrewsbury, and Vavasor Powell, a Welsh Independent preacher and theologian, were arrested and imprisoned. Ottley released Waring after a short time, as he was not persuaded there were good grounds or valid warrant for his detention. A Fifth Monarchist rising in London on 6 January 1661 panicked the Privy Council. On 8 January Newport was ordered to disarm any disaffected people in the county and to administer to them the Oath of Supremacy. On 22 January a further letter stepped up the pressure greatly with a demand that the county authorities arrest \"dangerous persons.\" Forwarding the Privy Council's letter to Ottley on 24 January, Newport rebuked him for being too lenient:  \n\"I send you enclosed a letter from the Councell, and a proclamation for the moderating of your proceedings. Though it may bee conceived a very ineffectual way for the securinge of persons to send warrants to a constable, yet if souldiers bringe the warrant to him, your ends may seeme accomplishable. You see the letter speakes of leadinge men. Therefore you did ill in releasinge Waringe, and you needed not have apprehended his ranting demand of a mittimus, which will serve him for discourse in his two pot houses. I would advise you to send for him agen, though not as a criminal by proofe, yet as a dangerous person, especially havinge the comand of the Councell for it.\"  \nHowever, Newport then drew Ottley's attention to an enclosed complaint from Captain Turner, who had been detained while visiting his wife and children at Shrewsbury, though he had a valid pass to do so from the authorities at Hull to do so: Newport urged Ottley allow him to leave the town. With neither Newport nor the Council quite able to define their desired balance of clemency and repression, Ottley seems to have erred on the side of rigour. By 4 March the Council was troubled that the Shropshire authorities might be overstepping the mark. They wrote to tell Newport that the king was troubled by large numbers of petitions from those arrested on mere suspicion and that they were to be released forthwith. Many of those arrested were Quakers, who had suffered persecution even before the Restoration. Henceforth, decreed the Council, only the \"Ringleaders of Faction\" were to be detained.  \nNevertheless, Newport had already recommended Ottley and Sir Francis Lawley as MPs for the county of Shropshire, and they were duly elected in April. However, the borough of Shrewsbury elected as its two members its town clerk, Thomas Jones, a leading Presbyterian although never an enthusiastic Parliamentarian, and Robert Leighton, who had been uncommitted in the Civil War.  Attempts under the Convention Parliament (1660) to accommodate the Presbyterians within the Church of England had come to nothing. Jones was determined to entrench Presbyterianism in Shrewsbury for as long as possible. In October 1661 he had a new deed of appointment drawn up for Francis Tallents, the Presbyterian minister of St Mary's Church, which was technically a Royal Peculiar but actually in the gift of the council. Jones was supported in this by the mayor, Richard Bagot, and the headmaster of Shrewsbury School, Richard Pigot. The Corporation Act of December 1661 gave Newport and Ottley an opportunity, as it sought to remove Presbyterians from office by forcing them to abjure the Solemn League and Covenant. Newport urged Ottley to use his seat at Westminster to speak out against Jones. Ottley's intervention sent Jones back to Shrewsbury, where he tried to get all vacant places on the council immediately filled with supporters. However, the deputy lieutenants sent men to impose house arrest on the mayor and aldermen and removed them from office for refusing to take the oath. Tallents and Pigot, together with other known Presbyterians and ex-Roundhead officers were imprisoned in July 1662. Newport and a group of county gentry were appointed commissioners to review and reform the governance of the town. They appointed Adam Ottley town clerk in place of Jones on 9 August, citing Jones's long record of political manoeuvring, promoting Presbytrerianism, giving legal advice to suspects. This was followed by a thorough purge of Nonconformists from public life. There was widespread agitation against the restored monarchy early in 1663. Repressive activity in Shropshire was initially at a lower level than in neighbouring counties. However, in July 1663 Newport used the rumour of a plot to seize Chester Castle to send Ottley after supposed conspiratorial meetings of ejected ministers in Shrewsbury, with detailed instructions for spying and intimidation. In October, with rumours of plots still abounding, Newport told Ottley to confine military preparations to the close guarding of the major towns to avoid the expense of mobilising the militia outside the time of the general muster. Later he reverted to warning that the Presbyterians of Shrewsbury might be in league with conspirators in the North of England and recommending that they and Waring be subject to a fishing expedition with a view to \"entrap some of them in their answers.\" A similar group of suspects were subjected to further detention in August 1665.\n\n## Cavalier Parliament  \nOttley was elected to the Parliament of 1661–79, the longest-lasting English parliament, and did not survive to the end of it, dying in 1670. The parliament was known as the Cavalier Parliament because it was largely royalist in sympathy, although important divisions appeared long before it ended. Ottley's election was almost certainly the result of Newport's influence. Newport, later first Earl of Bradford, was to dominate elections until his death in 1708, gradually evolving into a Whig and suffering for it when he opposed the succession of James II.  \nAfter being a very active lieutenant of Newport in the county, Ottley became a very active member of Parliament, which probably accounts for his decreasing participation in local and regional affairs. He was a member of no less than 230 committees. Initially much of his work reflected his work at local level, with a focus on legislation that repressed religious dissent. He was on the committee that steered the Act of Uniformity 1662. He was also a member of the committees for the Conventicle Act 1664 and a second Corporations Act, both elaborating the Clarendon Code which bore down on both Catholics and Protestant Nonconformists. His political loyalty and zeal brought appointment as a Gentleman of the Privy chamber on 18 December 1663. After the fall of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon in 1667, Ottley served on the committee to investigate his Sale of Dunkirk to France and another which looked into the running of the fund for loyal and indigent officers, which had been set up by the king to compensate royalist officers ruined by the Civil War. He had been one of the commissioners implementing the scheme in Shropshire. It had proved a disappointment and protests in 1666 led to a review.  \nOttley's own compensation took the form of commissions to collect taxes in Shropshire, which he undertook with his close friend and business partner, Richard Scriven, later MP for Bishop's Castle First they were made receivers of the county's hearth tax, the key tax on property. In 1663 they made a successful bid of £2,800 for the farm of the county's excise. However, the hearth tax concession was revoked in 1667 and Ottley and Scriven were ordered to pay arrears of £700. They sought to collect the amounts owing but this led to public disorder, with distrained goods and papers being stolen. To help his efforts at repayment, he was given any prize-money concealed during the Commonwealth that he could discover. He and Scriven were also granted all treasure trove found since the Restoration, as well as part of a Cheshire outlaw's estate. However, they were still unsuccessful. Ottley's arrears were remitted shortly before he died in 1670, although Scriven did not settle his debt until 1682.  \n## Marriage and family  \nRichard Ottley was married to Lady Lettice Ridgeway, daughter of Robert Ridgeway, 2nd Earl of Londonderry. The Ridgeway family fortune was based on the first earl's exploitation of land assigned to him as an \"undertaker,\" or government contactor, during the Plantation of Ulster. Richard and Lady Lettice Ottley had six sons and one daughter, five of whose baptisms are recorded in the Pitchford parish register.  \n* Francis, born 11 October 1649.

The events were held on 27 July 1936, 31 July 1937, 30 July 1938 and 29 July 1939, and were the evening highlight of the International Horse Racing Week Munich-Riem. Members of the SS-Cavalry, variety show girls, and international stars performed at the open-air revue with up to 2,500 participants.  \nIn addition to highlighting Munich as a travel destination, the event was intended to present Germany's Nazi regime as cosmopolitan and friendly to foreigners, and promote Nazi ideology.  \nPostcard promoting Munich as Hitler's \"Capital of German Art\", designed by Ludwig (Lutz) Ehrenberger, in the Olympia-Sommer 1936. In the foreground the amazon with longbow and victory wreath. The award of the horse races was The Brown Ribbon of Germany.\n\n## Origin  \nThe International Racing Week at Munich-Riem was invented in 1934 to present world-class equestrian sports in Munich and attract visitors to show off the new Nazi society. The event was organized by Christian Weber, whose personal friendship with Adolf Hitler went back to the early 1920s. All international horse clubs were invited. In 1936, the prize money for the Brown Ribbon of Germany was doubled. Being 100.000 Reichsmark, it was thus the continent's highest prize. That year was also a special anniversary, \"500 Years of Horse Racing in Munich\", which featured numerous major events. According to Weber, the evening highlight of the horse races for the Brown Ribbon should make a noise at home and in the world. Together with Paul Wolfrum, the head of tourism of Munich and Southern Bavaria, they created the \"Night of the Amazons\", an evening event with 10,000 spectators.  Weber used the former summer residence of the Bavarian kings as scenery for his ambitious self-portrayal and that of the Nazi ruling system.  \n## Preliminary work and financing  \nDespite weeks of personnel-intensive rehearsals and preparations, no alternative date was set. The enormously expensive financing was taken over by the Nazi regime organization The Brown Ribbon of Germany. For the first event in 1936, the two access avenues and the entire palace complex were provided with electric light for the first time. Concerns of the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes also had to be addressed, e.g., fire hazards due to large fireworks shows, and damage caused by horse hooves, crowds of people and underground installations. Security personnel were provided by the SS.  \n## Content  \nThe event always consisted of two different parts, which differed in content from year to year. Obvious Nazi propaganda was avoided. Besides international stars, hundreds of horses were put on stage. The first part of the event had a historical theme, which was located in the courtly 18th century environment, thereby branded as decadent. In the second part of the event, the \"New Age\" and \"Master Race\", glorified by the Nazi ideology, were presented. Under the pretext of ancient mythology more nudity was staged from year to year. A bronze sculpture created by Franz Stuck in 1913/14 was considered the Amazon par excellence. A replica was erected in front of the Villa Stuck in Munich in 1936.  \nIn 1936 Hans Gruß, the manager of the Deutsches Theater (Munich), directed the event. In 1937 he was replaced by Paul Wolz, who directed it until 1939. The dance performances incorporated choreographic inspiration from the latest UFA GmbH and Hollywood films.  \n<image>The German sculptor and painter Franz Stuck created 1914 the bronze casting of a nude amazon. This recast from 1936 was a gift to Adolf Hitler.\n\n\n## Lighting technology  \nWilhelm Hindelang was responsible for the lighting production. During a stay in New York City in 1936, the electrical engineer had studied the various lighting systems on Broadway theaters and the night illumination of Niagara Falls. The illumination of the \"Night of the Amazons\" enabled him to express his creativity and expertise. He worked out the lighting plans and created lighting effects with Ultraviolet light chains, colored underwater spotlights and a dance floor illuminated from below. A large part of the lighting and the telephone system for the direction and lighting instructions were provided by the armed forces (Wehrmacht). In 1938, the passionate amateur filmmaker with his innovative use of light was able to shoot the event on Kodachrome. It was probably the first color film shot at night in the German Reich.  \n## Horsemanship  \nEquestrian skills - including the High School of Classical dressage - were used by the ambitious SS riders to create a public impact. Many of the riders were members of the SS-Totenkopfverbände who guarded the Dachau concentration camp during the day. Hermann Fegelein, award-winning jump jockey and ambitious protégé of Christian Weber and head of the SS Main Riding School Riem since 1937, trained them as well as the \"Amazons\".  \n## Dance  \nThe  Munich State Opera ballet took part in the first Night of the Amazons in 1936. However, since classical ballet was said to have not enough Germanness and national pride and to be affected from foreign influence, a wide variety of dance schools with expressive dance were used from 1937 onwards. Following the Nazi ideology, the dancers symbolized the \"voluntary and vibrant integration into the large community structure with the so-called New Dance\". Young girls of the NS girls‘ organisation Faith and Beauty Society were used for mass scenes, too.  \n## Celebrity participants  \nEvery year, internationally renowned stars participated in the event, such as Margaret Severn from New York and Eugene Iskoldoff with dancers from the Covent Garden Ballet Russe in 1936. In the following years, the Scala-Girls from Berlin and the Hiller-Girls performed as well as singers like Hans-Hermann Nissen and Erna Sack.  \n## Nudity  \nChristian Weber increasingly made use of the insight he had gained during his 1937 visit to the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne - and the relevant establishments in Paris - that \"our naked German girls are better looking than the French women.\" His conclusion for the Night of the Amazons was: \"All we have to do is take off the clothes of the girls right here at home, put them into the spotlight, and men with money to spend will forsake Paris for Munich.\" From 1938 onward the number of girls dressed only in skin-colored panties increased. For the first time, 150 bronzed male and female participants were shown, who were covered with bronze-colored theatrical make-up from the crown to the sole, thus bearing considerable health risks.  \n<image>Detail of the illustrated program of the 1939 show. The artist, Albert Reich (1881–1942), was art director of the shows and created the cover for the first edition of Hitler's Mein Kampf.\n\n\n## Music  \nThe first part of the series began with fanfare blowers, followed by German military marches. After the break classical music alternated with singing. Hunting horn and alpine folk music were played as well.  \n## Spectators and Playing Field  \nTribunes and standing places were placed on the extended so-called inner ground floor of the Nymphenburg Park. The celebrities had their places of honour on the castle's perron. In 1936 almost all European kings were present. With 20.000 visitors, the Night of the Amazons was always sold out. To offer something to the curious spectators in front of the castle, the building was illuminated, open fire burned on pylons, gondolas drove down the castle canal.  \n## Safety Precautions  \nEvery year members of the Gestapo combed the extensive area of the Nymphenburg Palace with great care as the presence of Adolf Hitler was hoped for. Hitler, however, preferred the Bayreuth Festival with Richard Wagner's music taking place the same time.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

The course starts and finishes in Granollers and passes through Les Franqueses del Vallès and La Garriga. It is among the more popular half marathon events in Spain with around 10,000 runners taking part in the day's events.. In addition to the main half marathon race, there are two further events: a 5 km race for fun runners and \"the mini\", which hosts a range of short distances for children.  \nIn its early editions the race attracted a principally Spanish audience. The first African winner was Ezequiel Bitok in 1993 and his course record run of 1:01:48 hours marked the introduction of elite-level participation at the event. Alberto Juzdado became the first Spaniard to complete the course in under one hour and two minutes in 1998. In 2000, Esther Kiplagat of Kenya was the first foreign female to win at the event and she improved the course record by over two minutes. Two consecutive wins by marathon world record holder Haile Gebrselassie in 2005/2006 brought a Spanish all-comers record time of 60:08 minutes and further recognition of the race's elite level status, as did 10,000 m world champion Gete Wami's course record time of 1:10:24.2 hours in the women's race. The 2004 Olympic marathon champion Stefano Baldini and two-time European champion Marta Domínguez won the men's and women's races in 2007.  \nKenya's Samuel Wanjiru became the first man to run a sub-60-minute half marathon in Spain at the 2008 Granollers race: his time of 59:26 minutes was the fourth fastest time in the world that year. Both Wanjiru and Domínguez claimed their second Granollers titles the year afterwards.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Occupy London  \nOccupy London was a political movement in London, England, and part of the international Occupy movement. While some media described it as an \"anti-capitalist\" movement, in the statement written and endorsed by consensus by the Occupy assembly in the first two days of the occupation, occupiers defined themselves as a movement working to create alternatives to an \"unjust and undemocratic\" system. A second statement endorsed the following day called for \"real global democracy\". Due to a pre-emptive injunction, the protesters were prevented from their original aim to camp outside the London Stock Exchange. A camp was set up nearby next to St Paul's Cathedral. On 18 January 2012, Mr Justice Lindblom granted an injunction against continuation of the protest but the protesters remained in place pending an appeal. The appeal was refused on 22 February, and just past midnight on 28 February, bailiffs supported by City of London Police began to remove the tents.  \nThe protests began in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, United States, and with support from tax avoidance protest group UK Uncut and the London-based contingent of the Spanish 15M movement. In October protesters established a second encampments in Finsbury Square just to the north of the City of London. In November, a third site was opened in a disused office complex owned by UBS. Named by protesters as the Bank of Ideas, the site was located in Hackney and was evicted in late January 2012.  \nA fourth site was established in late December, at the disused premises of Old Street Magistrates Court in east London. The site's owners objected to its proposed long-term use by occupiers, and agreement was reached for the building to be vacated by the end of January 2012. In February 2012, occupiers were evicted from their main camp ar St Paul's, and from the Bank of Ideas, leaving Finsbury Square as the last London site to remain occupied. The Finsbury Square camp was cleared by authorities in June 2012.  \n## Chronology  \n### 2011 events  \n#### October  \nOn 10 October 2011, a campaign was launched on Facebook for protests to take place at the London Stock Exchange on 15 October in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York and with multiple other protests planned worldwide for that day.date=July 2021  \nAssange speaks at the Occupy London outside the cathedral in the City of London.  \nThe London Stock Exchange in Paternoster Square was the initial target for the protesters on 15 October. However, the police blocked access to the square, enforcing a High Court injunction against public access. 2,500–3,000 people gathered nearby outside St Paul's Cathedral, with around 250 camping overnight. During the afternoon of 15 October Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, gave an impromptu speech to the protesters on the topic of anonymity after he was challenged by police for wearing a mask as he walked to the protest. On the Sunday morning a canon of St. Paul's, Giles Fraser, asked the police to leave the cathedral steps, saying he was happy for people to \"exercise their right to protest peacefully\" outside the cathedral.  \nOn 16 October, a gathering of over 500 Occupy London protesters collectively agreed upon and issued the following 'Initial Statement':  \nBy 17 October, an encampment of around 150 tents together with makeshift tarpaulin shelters was clustered around the west side of St Paul's Cathedral.  \nOn 21 October, the Dean of St Paul's announced that the cathedral would be closing until further notice as a result of the Occupy London camp pitched outside, and asked the protesters to leave the vicinity of the building \"so that the cathedral can reopen as soon as possible\". On the evening of the 21st it was reported that the protesters had decided that they would remain in their encampment outside the cathedral, and that they believed that they could not be lawfully removed from the site without a court order.  \nOn 22 October, the protesters established a second camp in Finsbury Square, just north of the City of London in the London Borough of Islington.  \n<image>Solidarity poster referencing the We are the 99% slogan.\nOn 26 October it was reported that the Dean of St Paul's had decided that the cathedral would reopen on 28 October, following the resolution of all health and safety concerns. The move was described as an \"embarrassing U-turn\" by the British national newspaper The Daily Telegraph.  \nOn 27 October, Giles Fraser resigned as Canon Chancellor of St Paul's over disagreements on the handling of the demonstrators, saying \"I resigned because I believe that the chapter has set on a course of action that could mean there will be violence in the name of the church.\"  \nOn 28 October, the movement's first set of demands, \"Democratise The City of London Corporation\", was published.\n\n#### November  \nOn 1 November Graeme Knowles, the dean of St Paul's, resigned following the backlash against his Chapter's resolution to forcibly evict the Occupy London protesters from outside the cathedral. The City of London Corporation proceeded to take legal action against the camp at St Pauls, without support from the cathedral. Canary Wharf Group took legal action on 3 November to prevent Occupy London protesters from setting up camp in London's Docklands.  \nOn 18 November, protesters took over a disused office complex owned by the bank UBS, located in the London Borough of Hackney. The site was opened to the public the following day as the Bank of Ideas, and claimed to provide free services including a library, seminars and various discussion related events. On 28 November protesters at the Hackney site said they would contest attempts by lawyers to have them evicted.  \n#### December  \n<image>Caroline Lucas, at the time leader of the Green party, discussing green economics with occupiers at the Bank of Ideas on 6 December 2011.\nIn early December, the City of London Police made reference to Occupy London in a letter warning businesses about potential terrorist threats. It stated that: \"It is likely that activists aspire to identify other locations to occupy, especially those they identify with capitalism. City of London Police has received a number of hostile reconnaissance reports concerning individuals who would fit the anti-capitalist profile. All are asked to be vigilant regarding suspected reconnaissance, particularly around empty buildings.\" By late December, consensus among occupiers at the main camp in St Paul's had seemed to coalesce round a view that is would be better to leave voluntarily as long as they can be allowed to keep a small presence, and negotiations were started to see if agreement could be reached with the cathedral. Also, in late December, a fourth site was established in east London at an unused court and police complex. Occupiers announced plans to use the new site to host a symbolic \"trial of the 1%\"\n\n### 2012 events  \n<image>A view of the camp at Finsbury Square – by late February 2012 this was Occupy London's last remaining site, until it too was cleared in mid June.\nOn 18 January, the High Court ruled in favour of the City of London Corporation, giving them the power to order the eviction of occupiers from the St Paul's Camp. A spokesperson for the City said they would not further pursue eviction until 20 January, to give the occupiers a chance to appeal against the ruling. The appeal date was later set to 13 February 2012. Comparing the St Paul's camp as it was in January 2012 with its first few weeks, journalists such as Sid Ryan, Brendan O'Neill and Laurie Penny noted a change of character, with energy being diverted from political activism into caring for homeless and mentally ill people attracted by the companionship and shelter. Ryan has argued that despite caring for the homeless being a worthwhile cause, it may help the movement achieve change in the wider world if the camp is evicted.  \nOn 30 January, occupiers were evicted from the site where they had set up their Bank of Ideas, by bailiffs acting on behalf of UBS, who owned the premises.  \nIn mid February, Occupy London took over an abandoned school in Islington, which they called the School of Ideas.  They were evicted two weeks later, with authorities arranging for the school to be bulldozed on 28 February. Also on 28 February, occupiers and their tents were removed from the area surrounding St. Paul's Cathedral, by a team of bailiffs supported by riot police. The St Paul's site had been the last surviving high-profile camp of the worldwide Occupy movement. At the time of its eviction it was also the largest one remaining. According to the Financial Times, Occupy activists insisted that their campaigning would continue, with some displaying banners announcing that the protests so far were \"just the beginning.\"  \nIn April, Bloomberg reported that the St Paul's camp cost London authorities just over a million pounds in monitoring and legal fees, while the Finsbury Square camp had so far cost about £10,000.  \nIn December 2012, the Corporation of the City of London acquiesced to one of the Occupy London demands, releasing information about a previously secret bank account called City's Cash. This fund had existed for hundreds of years and proved to contain more than £1.319bn. With an income of £145m per annum, 29% of this comes from school fees, with a further eight per cent coming from rents and nine per cent coming from grants, reimbursements, and contributions. However, the largest source of revenue was 52 per cent from investments.\n\n\nQuestion: Which event do these images collectively represent?\nChoice list: \nA. Protests against global warming\nB.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Reaction progress kinetic analysis  \nIn chemistry, reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) is a subset of a broad range of kinetic techniques utilized to determine the rate laws of chemical reactions and to aid in elucidation of reaction mechanisms. While the concepts guiding reaction progress kinetic analysis are not new, the process was formalized by Professor Donna Blackmond (currently at Scripps Research Institute) in the late 1990s and has since seen increasingly widespread use. Unlike more common pseudo-first-order analysis, in which an overwhelming excess of one or more reagents is used relative to a species of interest, RPKA probes reactions at synthetically relevant conditions (i.e. with concentrations and reagent ratios resembling those used in the reaction when not exploring the rate law.) Generally, this analysis involves a system in which the concentrations of multiple reactants are changing measurably over the course of the reaction. As the mechanism can vary depending on the relative and absolute concentrations of the species involved, this approach obtains results that are much more representative of reaction behavior under commonly utilized conditions than do traditional tactics. Furthermore, information obtained by observation of the reaction over time may provide insight regarding unexpected behavior such as induction periods, catalyst deactivation, or changes in mechanism.  \n## Monitoring reaction progress  \nReaction progress kinetic analysis relies on the ability to accurately monitor the reaction conversion over time. This goal may be accomplished by a range of techniques, the most common of which are described below. While these techniques are sometimes categorized as differential (monitoring reaction rate over time) or integral (monitoring the amount of substrate and/or product over time), simple mathematical manipulation (differentiation or integration) allows interconversion of the data obtained by either of the two. Regardless of the technique implemented, it is generally advantageous to confirm the validity in the system of interest by monitoring with an additional independent method.  \n### Reaction progress NMR  \nNMR spectroscopy is often the method of choice for monitoring reaction progress, where substrate consumption and/or product formation may be observed over time from the change of peak integration relative to a non-reactive standard. From the concentration data, the rate of reaction over time may be obtained by taking the derivative of a polynomial fit to the experimental curve. Reaction progress NMR may be classified as an integral technique as the primary data collected are proportional to concentration vs. time. While this technique is extremely convenient for clearly defined systems with distinctive, isolated product and/or reactant peaks, it has the drawback of requiring a homogeneous system amenable to reaction in an NMR tube. While NMR observation may allow for the identification of a reaction intermediates, the presence of any given species over the course of the reaction does not necessarily implicate it in a productive process. Reaction progress NMR may, however, often be run at variable temperature, allowing the rate of reaction to be adjusted to a level convenient for observation. Examples of utilization of reaction progress NMR abound, with notable examples including investigation of Buchwald–Hartwig amination (One might note that considerable debate surrounded the best approach to mechanistic development of the Buchwald-Hartwig amination as indicated by a number of contradictory and competing reports published over a short period of time. See the designated article and references therein.)  \n### In situ FT-IR  \nIn situ infrared spectroscopy may be used to monitor the course of a reaction, provided a reagent or product shows distinctive absorbance in the IR spectral region. The rate of reactant consumption and/or product formation may be abstracted from the change of absorbance over time (by application of Beers' Law). Even when reactant and product spectra display some degree of overlap, modern instrumentation software is generally able to accurately deconvolute the relative contributions provided there is a dramatic change in the absolute absorbance of the peak of interest over time. In situ IR may be classified as an integral technique as the primary data collected are proportional to concentration vs. time. From these data, the starting material or product concentration over time may be obtained by simply taking the integral of a polynomial fit to the experimental curve. With increases in the availability of spectrometers with in situ monitoring capabilities, FT-IR has seen increasing use in recent years. Examples of note include mechanistic analysis of the amido-thiourea catalyzed asymmetric Strecker synthesis of unnatural amino acids and of the Lewis base catalyzed halolactonization and cycloetherification.  \n### In situ UV-vis  \nAnalogously to the in situ IR experiments described above, in situ UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy may be used to monitor the course of a reaction, provided a reagent or product shows distinctive absorbance in the UV spectral region. The rate of reactant consumption and/or product formation may be abstracted from the change of absorbance over time (by application of Beer's Law), again leading to classification as an integral technique. Due to the spectral region utilized, UV-vis techniques are more commonly utilized on inorganic or organometallic systems than on purely organic reactions, and examples include exploration of the samarium Barbier reaction.  \n### Reaction calorimetry  \nCalorimetry may be used to monitor the course of a reaction, since the instantaneous heat flux of the reaction, which is directly related to the enthalpy change for the reaction, is monitored. Reaction calorimetry may be classified as a differential technique since the primary data collected are proportional to rate vs. time. From these data, the starting material or product concentration over time may be obtained by simply taking the integral of a polynomial fit to the experimental curve.  \nWhile reaction calorimetry is less frequently employed than a number of other techniques, it has found use as an effective tool for catalyst screening. Reaction calorimetry has also been applied as an efficient method for mechanistic study of individual reactions including the prolinate-catalyzed α-amination of aldehydes and  the palladium catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig amination reaction.  \n### Further techniques  \nWhile Gas Chromatography, HPLC, and Mass Spectrometry are all excellent techniques for distinguishing mixtures of compounds (and sometimes even enantiomers), the time resolution of these measurements is less precise than that of the techniques described above. Regardless, these techniques have still seen use, such as in the investigation of the Heck reaction where the heterogeneous nature of the reaction precluded utilization of the techniques described above. and SOMO-activation by organocatalysts Despite their shortcomings, these techniques may serve as excellent calibration methods.  \n## Data manipulation and presentation  \na) The concentrations of substrate and/or product are monitored over time by methods such as in situ IR, UV-vis, or NMR or may be obtained by taking the integral of (c). b) Presenting the fractional conversion of substrate provides a normalization of the data in (a). c) The rate of reaction progress (product formation) is monitored over time by methods such as reaction progress calorimetry or may be obtained by taking the first derivative of (a). d) Describing the rate of reaction progress with respect to consumption of starting material spreads the data into a more informative distribution than observed in (c). Note that reaction progress is read from right (maximum substrate concentration) to left (no remaining substrate) in (d).  \nReaction progress data may often most simply be presented as plot of substrate concentration (At) vs. time (t) or fraction conversion (F) vs. time (t). The latter requires minor algebraic manipulation to convert concentration/absorbance values to fractional conversion (F), by:  \nF = sfrac|A0 − At|A0  \nwhere A0 is the amount, absorbance, or concentration of substrate initially present and At is the amount, absorbance, or concentration of that reagent at time, t. Normalizing data to fractional conversion may be particularly helpful as it allows multiple reactions run with different absolute amounts or concentrations to be compared on the same plot.  \nData may also commonly be presented as a plot of reaction rate (v) vs. time (t). Again, simple algebraic manipulation is required; for example, calorimetric experiments give:  \nv = VΔH  \nwhere q is the instantaneous heat transfer, ΔH is the known enthalpy change of the reaction, and V is the reaction volume.  \nData from reaction progress kinetics experiments are also often presented via a rate (v) vs. substrate concentration (S) plot. This requires obtaining and combining both the S vs. t and the v vs. t plots described above (note that one may be obtained from the other by simple differentiation or integration.) The combination leads to a standard set of curves in which reaction progress is read from right to left along the x-axis and reaction rate is read from bottom to top along the y-axis. While these plots often provide a visually compelling demonstration of basic kinetic trends, differential methods are generally superior for extracting numerical rate constants. (see below)  \n## Catalytic kinetics and catalyst resting state  \nIn catalytic kinetics, two basic approximations are useful (in different circumstances) to describe the behavior of many systems. The situations in which the pre-equilibrium and steady-state approximations are valid can often be distinguished by reaction progress kinetic analysis, and the two situations are closely related to the resting state of the catalyst.  \n### The steady-state approximation  \n<image>k−1k−2 + k−1k3 + k2k3B\nIncreasingly complex systems can be described simply with the algorithm described in this reference.  \nIn the case of the steady-state conditions described above, the catalyst resting state is the unbound form (because the substrate-bound intermediate is, by definition, only present at a minimal concentration.)\n\n### The pre-equilibrium approximation  \na) The simplest case of pre-equilibrium kinetics involves one substrate rapidly and reversibly forming an intermediate complex with the catalyst, followed by irreversible product formation. b) In a more complex example, two substrates sequentially bind the catalyst rapidly and reversibly followed by irreversible product formation. For both (a) and (b), i) describes the catalytic cycle with relevant rate constants and concentrations, ii) displays the concentration of product and reactant over the course of the reaction, iii) describes the rate of the reaction as substrate is consumed from right to left, and iv) shows that the catalyst resting state is an equilibrium distribution of free catalyst and intermediates where the distribution is shifted increasingly toward free catalyst as substrate is consumed from right to left.  \nUnder pre-equilibrium conditions, the catalyst and substrate undergo rapid and reversible association prior to a relatively slow step leading to product formation and release. Under these conditions, the system can be described by a \"one-plus\" rate law where the numerator consists of all rate constants and species required to go from starting material to product, and the denominator consists of a sum of terms describing each of the states in which the catalyst exists (and 1 corresponds to the free catalyst). For the simplest case where one substrate goes to one product through a single intermediate:  \nsfrac|dP|dt = sfrac|K1k2ACat|1 + K1A  \nIn the slightly more complex situation where two substrates bind in sequence followed by product release:  \nsfrac|dP|dt = sfrac|K1K2k3ABCat|1 + K1A + K1K2AB  \nIn the case of the simple pre-equilibrium conditions described above, the catalyst resting state is either entirely or partially (depending on the magnitude of the equilibrium constant) the substrate bound complex.  \n### Saturation kinetics  \nSaturation conditions can be viewed as a special case of pre-equilibrium conditions. At the concentration of substrate examined, formation of the catalyst-substrate complex is rapid and essentially irreversible. The catalyst resting state consists entirely of the bound complex, and A is no longer present in the rate law; changing A will have no effect on reaction rate because the catalyst is already completely bound and reacting as rapidly as k2 allows. The simplest case of saturation kinetics is the well-studied Michaelis-Menten model for enzyme kinetics.  \n### Changes in catalyst resting state  \n<image>At\nadjusts for the consumption of substrate over the course of the reaction, so only rate changes due to catalyst loading will be observed. A linear dependence on catalyst loading for a given conversion is indicative of a first order dependence on catalyst at that conversion, and one can similarly imagine the non-linear plots resulting from higher order dependence. Changes in the linearity or non-linearity from one set of conversion points to another are indicative of changes in the dependence on catalyst over the course of the reaction. Conversely, changes in the linearity or non-linearity of regions of the plot conserved over multiple conversion points (i.e. at 30, 50, and 70%) are indicative of a change in the dependence on catalyst based on the absolute catalyst concentration.  \nCatalyst interactions with multiple components of a reaction mixture can lead to a complex kinetic dependence. While off-cycle catalyst-substrate or catalyst-product interactions are generally considered \"poisonous\" to the system (certainly the case in the event of irreversible complexation) cases do exist in which the off-cycle species actually protects the catalyst from permanent deactivation.  \nIn either case, it is often essential to understand the role of the catalyst resting state.\n\n## Same-excess experiments  \nThe variable parameter of greatest interest in reaction progress kinetic analysis is the excess (e) of one substrate over another, given in units of molarity. The initial concentrations of two species in a reaction may be defined by:  \nB0 = A0 + e  \nand, assuming a one-to-one reaction stoichiometry, that excess of one substrate over the other is quantitatively preserved over the course of the entire reaction such that:  \nBt = At + e  \nA similar set can be constructed for reactions with higher order stoichiometry in which case the excess varies predictably over the course of the reaction. While e may be any value (positive, negative, or zero) generally positive or negative values smaller in magnitude than one equivalent of substrate are used in reaction progress kinetic analysis. (One might note that pseudo-zero-order kinetics uses excess values much much greater in magnitude than the one equivalent of substrate).  \nDefining the parameter of excess (e) allows for the construction of same-excess experiments in which two or more runs of a kinetic experiment with different initial concentrations, but the same-excess allow one to artificially enter the reaction at any point. These experiments are critical for RPKA of catalytic reactions, as they enable one to probe a number of mechanistic possibilities including catalyst activation (induction periods), catalyst deactivation, and product inhibition described in further detail below.  \n### Determining catalyst turnover frequency  \nPrior to further mechanistic investigation, it is important to determine the kinetic dependence of the reaction of interest on the catalyst. The turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalyst can be expressed as the reaction rate normalized to the concentration of catalyst:  \nTOF = sfrac|v|Cat  \nThis TOF is determined by running any two or more same-excess experiments in which the absolute catalyst concentration is varied. Because the catalyst concentration is constant over the course of the reaction, the resulting plots are normalized by an unchanging value. If the resulting plots overlay perfectly, then the reaction is, in fact, first-order in catalyst. If the reaction fails to overlay, higher-order processes are at work and require a more detailed analysis than described here. It is also worth noting that the normalization-overlay manipulation described here is only one approach for interpretation of the raw data. Equally valid results may be obtained by fitting the observed kinetic behavior to simulated rate laws.  \n### Exploring catalyst activation and deactivation  \n<image>a) According to the proposed mechanism for the palladium-catalyzed amination of aryl halides, an induction period will be present as the active catalyst is generated from an inactive pre-catalyst (where L = BINAP). b) This induction period may be observed at early conversion points, before the catalyzed reaction reaches its maximum rate. In same-excess experiments, this will manifest itself in the non-overlying portions of curves designed to intercept the original reaction at intermediate conversion points. Here, a same-excess (e = 0.60 M) of ArX relative to HNR2 and MOR is utilized for each of the curves.\nAs described above, same-excess experiments are conducted with two or more experiments holding the excess, (e) constant while changing the absolute concentrations of the substrates (in this case, the catalyst is also treated as a substrate.) Note that this construction causes the number of equivalents and therefore the mole percentage of each reagent/catalyst to differ between reactions. These experiments enable one to artificially \"enter\" the reaction at any point, as the initial concentrations of one experiment (the intercepting reaction) are chosen to map directly onto the anticipated concentrations at some intermediate time, t, in another (the parent reaction). One would expect the reaction progress, described by the rate vs. substrate concentration plots detailed above, to map directly onto each other from that interception point onward. This will hold true, however, only if the rate of the reaction is not altered by changes to the active substrate/catalyst concentration (such as by catalyst activation, catalyst deactivation, or product inhibition) before that interception.  \nA perfect overlay of multiple experiments with the same-excess but different initial substrate loadings suggests that no changes in the active substrate/catalyst concentration occur over the course of the reaction. The failure of the plots to overlay is generally indicative of catalyst activation, deactivation, or product inhibition under the reaction conditions. These cases may be distinguished by the position of the reaction progress curves relative to each other. Intercepting reactions lying below (slower rates at the same substrate concentration) the parent reactions on the rate vs. substrate concentration plot, are indicative of catalyst activation under reaction conditions. Intercepting reactions lying above (faster rates at the same substrate concentration) the parent reactions on the rate vs. substrate concentration plot, are indicative of catalyst deactivation under reaction conditions; further experimentation is necessary to distinguish product inhibition from other forms of catalyst death.  \nOne key difference between the intercepting reaction and the parent reaction described above is the presence of some amount of product in the parent reaction at the interception point. Product inhibition has long been known to influence catalyst efficiency of many systems, and in the case of same-excess experiments, it prevents the intercepting and parent reactions from overlaying. While same-excess experiments as described above cannot attribute catalyst deactivation to any particular cause, product inhibition can be probed by further experiments in which some initial amount of product is added to the intercepting reaction (designed to mimic the amount of product expected to be present in the parent reaction at the same substrate concentration). A perfect overlay of the rate vs. substrate concentration plots under same-excess-same product conditions indicates that product inhibition does occur under the reaction conditions used. While the failure of the rate vs. substrate concentration plots to overlay under same-excess-same product conditions does not preclude product inhibition, it does, at least, indicate that other catalyst deactivation paths must also be active.  \nReaction progress kinetic analysis can distinguish a) uninhibited catalysis b) irreversible catalyst death, and c) product inhibition by a series of same-excess experiments. Lack of overlay between rate vs. substrate concentration for multiple trials of the same reaction with the same-excess but different initial concentrations is indicative of product inhibition or catalyst death. The two may be distinguished where overlay of same-excess experiments with added product is indicative of product inhibition, where lack of overlay is indicative of an alternative form of catalyst death.  \nSame-excess experiments probing catalyst deactivation and product inhibition are among the most widely used applications of reaction progress kinetic analysis. Among the numerous examples in the literature, some include investigation of the amino alcohol-catalyzed zinc alkylation of aldehydes, the amido-thiourea catalyzed asymmetric Strecker synthesis of unnatural amino acids, and the SOMO-activation of organocatalysts.\n\n## Determining reaction stoichiometry  \n### Differential methods for extracting rate constants  \nWith the wealth of data available from monitoring reaction progress over time paired with the power of modern computing methods, it has become reasonably straightforward to numerically evaluate the rate law, mapping the integrated rate laws of simulated reactions paths onto a fit of reaction progress over time. Due to the principles of the propagation of error, rate constants and rate laws can be determined by these differential methods with significantly lower uncertainty than by the construction of graphical rate equations (above.)  \n### Different-excess experiments  \nWhile RPKA allows observation of rates over the course of the entire reaction, conducting only same-excess experiments does not provide sufficient information for determination of the corresponding rate constants. In order to construct enough independent relationships to solve for all of the unknown rate constants, it is necessary to examine systems with different-excess.  \n<image>Consider the simple example where the catalyst associates with substrate A, followed by reaction with B to form product, P and free catalyst. Regardless of the approximation applied, multiple independent parameters (k1, k−1, and k2 in the case of steady-state; k2 and K1 in the case of pre-equilibrium) are required to define the system. While one could imagine constructing multiple equations to describe the unknowns at different concentrations, when the data is obtained from a same-excess experiment A and B are not independent. Multiple experiments using different values of e are necessary to establish multiple independent equations defining the multiple independent rate constants in terms of experimental rates and concentrations. Non-linear least squares analysis may then be employed to obtain best fit values of the unknown rate constants to those equations.\nConsider again the simple example discussed above where the catalyst associates with substrate A, followed by reaction with B to form product P and free catalyst. Regardless of the approximation applied, multiple independent parameters (k2 and K1 in the case of pre-equilibrium; k1, k−1, and k2 in the case of steady-state) are required to define the system. While one could imagine constructing multiple equations to describe the unknowns at different concentrations, when the data is obtained from a same-excess experiment A and B are not independent:  \ne = B − A  \nMultiple experiments using different values of e are necessary to establish multiple independent equations defining the multiple independent rate constants in terms of experimental rates and concentrations. Non-linear least squares analysis may then be employed to obtain best fit values of the unknown rate constants to those equations.\n\n### Graphical rate laws  \nOne possible sequence for establishing kinetic order by reaction progress kinetic analysis. Adapted with modification from the process proposed by Donna Blackmond  \nKineticists have historically relied on linearization of rate data to extrapolate rate constants, perhaps best demonstrated by the widespread use of the standard Lineweaver–Burk linearization of the Michaelis–Menten equation. Linearization techniques were of particular importance before the advent of computing techniques capable of fitting complex curves, and they remain a staple in kinetics due to their intuitively simple presentation. It is important to note that linearization techniques should NOT be used to extract numerical rate constants as they introduce a large degree of error relative to alternative numerical techniques. Graphical rate laws do, however, maintain that intuitive presentation of linearized data, such that visual inspection of the plot can provide mechanistic insight regarding the reaction at hand. The basis for a graphical rate law rests on the rate (v) vs. substrate concentration (S) plots discussed above. For example, in the simple cycle discussed with regard to different-excess experiments a plot of sfrac|v|A vs. B and its twin sfrac|v|B vs. A can provide intuitive insight about the order of each of the reagents. If plots of sfrac|v|A vs. B overlay for multiple experiments with different-excess, the data are consistent with a first-order dependence on A. The same could be said for a plot of sfrac|v|B vs. A; overlay is consistent with a first-order dependence on B. Non-overlaying results of these graphical rate laws are possible and are indicative of higher order dependence on the substrates probed. Blackmond has proposed presenting the results of different-excess experiments with a series of graphical rate equations (that she presents in a flow-chart adapted here), but it is important to note that her proposed method is only one of many possible methods to display the kinetic relationship. Furthermore, while the presentation of graphical rate laws may at times be considered a visually simplified way to present complex kinetic data, fitting the raw kinetic data for analysis by differential or other rigorous numerical methods is necessary to extract accurate and quantitative rate constants and reaction orders.  \n### Reaction stoichiometry and mechanism  \nIt is important to note that even while kinetic analysis is a powerful tool for determining the stoichiometry of the turn-over limiting transition state relative to the ground state, it cannot answer all mechanistic questions. It is possible for two mechanisms to be kinetically indistinguishable, especially under catalytic conditions. For any thorough mechanistic evaluation it is necessary to conduct kinetic analysis of both the catalytic process and its individual steps (when possible) in concert with other forms of analysis such as evaluation of linear free energy relationships, isotope effect studies, computational analysis, or any number of alternative approaches. Finally, it is important to note that no mechanistic hypothesis can ever be proven; alternative mechanistic hypothesis can only be disproven. It is, therefore, essential to conduct any investigation in a hypothesis-driven manner. Only by experimentally disproving reasonable alternatives can the support for a given hypothesis be strengthened.\n\nQuestion: Which image describes an experimental setup that allows for the distinction between product inhibition and other forms of catalyst deactivation?\nChoice list: \nA.

Nasser's tenure as Egypt's leader heralded a new period of modernisation and socialist reform in Egypt, along with a staunch advocacy of pan-Arab nationalism (including a short-lived union with Syria), and developing world solidarity. His prestige in Egypt and throughout the Arab World soared in the wake of his nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company in 1956, and Egypt's political victory in the subsequent Tripartite Aggression, but was damaged badly by Israel's successful invasion and occupation of Jordanian, Egyptian, Palestinian, and Syrian territory in the Six-Day War of 1967.  \nThe era witnessed a rapid increase in living standards unparalleled in Egypt's millennia of history, and is regarded as a time when ordinary Egyptian citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, employment, healthcare, and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while the influence of the former aristocracy waned, as did that of the Western governments that had hitherto dominated Egyptian affairs. The national economy grew significantly through agrarian reform, major modernisation projects, such as the Helwan steel works, and the Aswan High Dam, and the nationalisation of key parts of the economy, notably the Suez Canal Company. At its economic peak, Nasser's Egypt was capable of not only offering free education and healthcare to its own citizens but also to the citizens of other Arab and African countries, who were offered full scholarships and living allowances to undertake higher education in Egypt before returning to their home countries. However, the substantial economic growth that marked the early 1960s took a downturn later in the decade, particularly as Egypt's military quagmire in the North Yemen Civil War deepened, only recovering in the late 1970s. During Nasser's time in office, Egypt experienced a golden age of culture, particularly in theatre, film, poetry, television, radio, literature, fine arts, comedy, and music. Egypt under Nasser dominated the Arab World in these fields, with Egyptian musical artists such as Abdel Halim Hafez, Umm Kulthum, and Mohammed Abdel Wahab, literary figures such as Naguib Mahfouz, and Tawfiq el-Hakim, actors such as Faten Hamama, Salah Zulfikar, Soad Hosny and Rushdi Abaza, and the release of over 100 films yearly, compared to the production of just more than a dozen annually during Hosni Mubarak's presidency (1981–2011).\n\n## Republic of Egypt (1953–58)  \n### Egyptian revolution of 1952  \nOn 22–26 July 1952, the Free Officers, a group of disaffected officers in the Egyptian army founded by Gamal Abdel Nasser and headed by General Muhammad Naguib, initiated the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 which overthrew King Farouk, whom the military blamed for Egypt's poor performance in the 1948 war with Israel and lack of progress in fighting poverty, disease and illiteracy in Egypt. The monarchy of Egypt and Sudan was gone without \"a voice\" being \"raised\" in its favour. In the following two years, the Free Officers consolidated power. Popular expectations for immediate reforms led to the workers' riots in Kafr Dawar on 12 August 1952, which resulted in two death sentences. Following a brief experiment with civilian rule, the Free Officers abrogated the 1953 constitution and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953, Muhammad Naguib as Egypt's first President. Within six months all civilian political parties were banned replaced by the \"Liberation Rally\" government party, the elites seeing a need for a \"transitional authoritarianism\" in light of Egypt's poverty, illiteracy and lack of a large middle class.  \n### Suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood  \nIn January, the large Muslim Brotherhood organization was outlawed, remaining an illegal political organization until the Revolution of 2011. The move came in the wake of clashes between members of the Brotherhood and Liberation Rally student demonstrators on 12 January 1954. On 26 October, an assassination attempt suspected by the Brotherhood was directed at Nasser during a rally in Alexandria. This led to the regime acting against the Brotherhood, executing Brotherhood leaders on 9 December.  \n### Presidency of Nasser  \nGamal Abdel Nasser first became prime minister in February 1954. He was chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council from November 1954 until he became President of Egypt in 1956, and served as president until his death in 1970.  \n### 1956  \nMeanwhile, the RCC, morally backed by both the Soviet Union and the United States, managed to remain united in its opposition to the British and French, specifically in regard to the Suez. Despite continued calls from the RCC, in debates in the United Nations, and pressure from both the US and USSR, the British refused to transfer control of the Canal to the new regime.  The RCC began funding and coordinating ever greater attacks on the British and French in the Suez and Damietta. Finally, on 19 October, Nasser signed a treaty for the evacuation of British troops from Egypt, to be completed over the following 20 months. Two years later, on 18 June 1956, Nasser raised the Egyptian flag over the Canal Zone, announcing the complete evacuation of British troops.  \n### New Constitution  \nPresident Nasser announced a new Constitution on 16 January at a popular rally, setting up a presidential system of government in which the president has the power to appoint and dismiss ministers. An elections law was passed on 3 March granting women the right to vote for the first time in Egyptian history. Nasser was elected as the second president of the Republic on 23 June. In 1957, Nasser announced the formation of the National Union (Al-Ittihad Al-Qawmi), paving the way to July elections for the National Assembly, the first parliament since 1952.  \n## Economy and society  \n<image>Nasser handing documents to an Egyptian fellah in a land distribution ceremony in Minya, 1954\n\n\n### Land reform  \nThe original revolutionaries wanted an end to British occupation but did not have a unified ideology or plan for Egypt.  One issue that was agreed on and acted quickly on was land reform. Less than six percent of  Egypt's population owned more than 65% of the land in Egypt, while at the top and less than 0.5% of Egyptians owned more than one-third of all fertile land.  the process of land reform began on September 11, 1952, when (among many provisions) a law  prohibited ownership of more than 200 feddans of land (840000 sq meters); limited the rental rate for land; established cooperatives for farmers; minimum wages, etc.  \nDuring the presidency of Nasser, cultivated land in Egypt increased by almost a third (an achievement that had reportedly eluded Egyptians for more than a millennium).  \n### Economy  \nEgypt's economy grew at an average rate of 9% per annum for almost a decade.  The share of manufacturing to Egypt's GDP rose from around 14% in the late 1940s to 35% by the early 1970s.  \n\"The combination of the land-reform programme and the creation of the public sector in Egypt resulted in around 75% of Egypt's gross domestic product (GDP) being transferred from the hands of the country's rich either to the state or to millions of small owners. The closest parallel to such a large-scale social programme had been in the early days of Mohamed Ali Pasha's rule in the early nineteenth century.\"  \n### Exile of Jews  \nIn 1956–1957, 25,000 Jews – almost half of the Jewish population of Egypt – were expelled from the country. Another 1,000 were imprisoned. (By 1972 the remainder had also been expelled.)  \n## Foreign affairs  \n<image>Nasser addressing the United Nations General Assembly, 1960\nEgypt's nationalisation of the British-owned Suez Canal was a great victory for Nasser who was celebrated as both an Egyptian hero and an Arab one, capable of 'defeating the nation's enemies' and'representing Arab dignity'.\"  Chinese premier Zhou Enlai called Nasser 'the giant of the Middle East.'  \nNasser emerged as one of the architects of the Non-Aligned Movement, which was founded in 1961 as a bloc of 'independent nations' detached from both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Almost all African anti-colonialist freedom fighters came to him for guidance, moral support and funds.\n\n### Opposition to Baghdad Pact  \nA major reason why conservative Arab regimes felt threatened by Nasser during his first years in power was that his popularity had been demonstrated – even before the Suez crisis – when he became a leading critic of the 1955 Baghdad Pact. The Baghdad Pact was initially an alliance between Iraq and Turkey, which Britain supported with the goal of strengthening its power within the Middle East. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact to be part of a British effort to split the Arab countries into differing groups, and to divide the region by escalating tension between them. The British later attempted to bring Jordan into the Baghdad Pact in late 1955 after Nasser agreed to purchase arms from Czechoslovakia in the Soviet bloc. The British were determined to bring Jordan into the Baghdad Pact and to apply pressure to try to force Jordan to join. Nasser had opposed the Baghdad Pact, and his successful effort to prevent Jordan from joining the pact is an example of his pragmatic diplomatic strategy. Nasser's pragmatism towards Jordan meant that he aimed to force the Jordan regime to decline to join the pact, but he did not himself attempt to overthrow the regime. This stance was rewarded with Jordanian support for Egypt during the Suez Crisis the following year in 1956.  \nThe dispute over Jordanian membership in the Baghdad Pact lasted from November to December 1955. Nasser's goal was based on Egyptian national interests – he wanted to prevent Jordanian membership in the Baghdad Pact, which was more important to him than the fate of the Jordanian regime. He was thus prepared to offer the Jordanian regime a way out in which it could survive if it did not join the pact. Nasser's strategy during the debate over the Baghdad Pact was to apply rhetorical pressure using Egyptian propaganda to launch broadcasts attacking the British, and also warning the Jordanian regime that it could be overthrown if it agreed to join the pact.  The Egyptian propaganda led to riots occurring in Jordan in December 1955 during a visit of British Field Marshal Templer, who was serving as the British Defense Chief of Staff.  \nThe nature of the message that Egyptian propaganda conveyed during the crisis over Jordanian accession to the Baghdad pact is very significant. Its primary focus was on attacking the British rather than the Jordanian regime itself, and it did not itself call for the overthrow of King Hussein. In other words, this propaganda was intended to pressure the regime, and likely to implicitly convince King Hussein that his prospects for remaining in power would be greater if he declined to join the Baghdad Pact, and Jordan decided in December that it would not join the agreement. King Hussein remained in power, and sided with Egypt in future crises such as in the 1956 Suez Crisis or in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Egypt thus derived a direct reward from their pragmatic approach towards King Hussein's regime, and the example of the dispute over the Baghdad Pact may have convinced King Hussein that he needed to align with Egypt in future crisis situations. The power of Arab Nationalism also led King Hussein to dismiss the British General John Bagot Glubb as commander of the Arab Legion in 1956. The dismissal of Glubb took place while the British Foreign Secretary was in Egypt, and the British believed that represented a direct challenge by Nasser to their authority in the region.  \n### The Tripartite Aggression  \n<image>Nasser returns to cheering crowds in Cairo after announcing the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company\n\n\n#### Background  \nEgypt had been seeking loans from the World Bank since late 1955 to finance the construction of the Aswan High Dam. A tentative agreement with the World Bank, the US and Britain indicated that US$70 million would be provided for the project. However, Nasser had recently (September 27, 1955) negotiated an agreement with the Soviet Union which provided technical and military aid to the regime, thereby angering the United States which had up until the point been supportive of Nasser and his anti-British and anti-French colonialism.  Consequently, after pressure from the British government concerning the threat posed by Nasser, on 20 July 1956, the US and Britain withdrew their offers of funding, and the World Bank went back on the agreement. On 26 July, Nasser gave a historic speech announcing the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company, under his \"Egyptianization\" policy, and whose revenues would be used to finance the construction of the High Dam, which was completed in January 1968.  The nationalisation escalated tension with Britain and France, which froze Egyptian assets and put their armies on alert.  \nOn 1 August, the USSR offered to fund the High Dam project. Relations with Britain and France which had deteriorated to a frosty cold war level by the summer, were framed anew when the United States withdrew much of its support in demonstration against Nasser's growing friendship with the Soviet Union.  Having at last convinced the United States of its error in supporting the Free Officers Movement and the special threat posed by Nasser, the British and French felt free to intrigue for his overthrow. These moves culminated in the Tripartite Anglo-French-Israeli aggression on Egypt in October.  \n#### Plan  \nIn a final replay of old European power politics, the British and French negotiated a plan with Israel which would result in the return of the Suez to the British and French, the overthrow of the Nasser regime, and restoration of European, Christian and Jewish property.  Although the later had suffered under the new regime, unlike the Europeans, most Jewish property survived the Egyptianization.  Consequently, Israel, which had previously been used as an interlocuteur for both Soviet and American support for the RCC still had substantial elements operating in Egypt.  Now the British and French decided to use this to their advantage once Israel saw the large threat Nasser posed to their continued existence.  Under their plan, Israeli elements in Egypt with launch false flag operations which would be used as a pretext for Israeli launching a surprise attack on Egypt across the Sinai and toward the Suez.  Using the terms of the Canal treaty which allowed the British and French to use military force in protection of the canal, an Anglo-French force would invade the canal area and subsequently invade Cairo.  \n#### Invasion  \nIsraeli troops invaded Gaza and advanced toward the Sinai on 29 October.  Accordingly, under the terms of the Canal Treaty, the British and French troops attacked the Canal Zone on 31 October using a combined force of air strikes, naval bombardment, and parachute drops.  Large amphibious and infantry units were steaming from Cyprus and Algeria toward the canal for the final occupation and push into Cairo. Whilst the operation had all the elements necessary for surprise and legerdemain, it lacked quickness of speed given the relative strategic weakness which the British and French found themselves in the post-war period.  \nFor although the British and French still had substantial force projection capabilities and were the overwhelming military power in the region, both countries were heavily dependent on American support for their economies through the purchase of British and French debt, American direct investment, and most importantly, through the support American oil companies provided for European consumption.  Consequently, by the time when the Anglo-French armada began its reinforcement of British and French positions on the Canal, the American government had already come under massive pressure from the United Nations, the Soviet Union, and most importantly from American oil companies which saw the British and French as impediments to their commercial expansion in the Middle East.  \nWhen the American anger at the British and French intervention was felt at Whitehall, the British government fractured between those who saw the futility of maintaining the British Empire, those who saw the potential threat the Americans posed to the overall British economy should they end financial support of the British economy, and those British interests which still saw a need, a necessity and a reason for maintaining the British Empire. Thus, when the Eisenhower Administration initiated an oil embargo on the British and French, there was immediate panic in the British government.  The French however were proving more resolute and flouted American demands stating matter of factly that America had no interest in the Middle East and were duplicitous in their support of Arab nationalism and anti-colonialism.  \nHowever, with the embargo, the British pound which as a reserve currency was used in the purchase of oil had its liquidity threatened.  While the British government debated this turn of events, the military campaign dithered and proved lacklustre in its execution, thereby buying crucial time for the Nasser regime to rally support from American liberals, the Soviet Union, and others in the United Nations.  Finally, when in a bid of solidarity with the Nasser regime, the US government said it would no longer price support the British pound through the purchasing of British debt, the appeasers within the British government gained the upper hand and forced a surrender to American demands. Consequently, British operations were halted on 7 November.  When negotiations between the British and Americans made clear that the US was in opposition to the continuation of the British and French Empires, the British government's position on its control of the Suez Canal collapsed.  Henceforth it was not military operations but the liquidation of what remained of British and French assets and prestige which allowed the Anglo-French armies to remain until finally, on 22 December they were removed.  As a result, all British and French banks and companies, 15,000 establishments in all, were nationalized, a process that was later extended to all foreign establishments and also to Egyptian firms. But more importantly, the event marked the abandonment of by the United States to an overt Western Civilizational identity especially of supremacy, as well as America's opposition to a European global commercial presence which it viewed as a competitor to its own global vision.  As a result, with the primary leader of the West opposed to the very raison d'être of European colonialism, the Suez Crisis, initiated by the Free Officers Movement and the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 marked the end of European Civilization Supremacy.  \nAccording to the prominent historian Abd aI-’Azim Ramadan, Nasser decision to nationalize the Suez Canal was his alone, made without political or military consultation. The events leading up to the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, as other events during Nasser's rule, showed Nasser's inclination to solitary decision making. He considers Nasser to be far from a rational, responsible leader.  \n### Union with Syria  \nright  \nOn 22 February 1958, Egypt united with Syria, creating the United Arab Republic (UAR). The 1956 Constitution was abrogated following the union and a provisional one decreed. The Egyptian National Assembly was dissolved. On 2 April, Nasser issued a decree establishing the flag of the Republic as three horizontal bars of red, white and black with two stars. There was a crackdown on communists on 31 December for their allegedly lukewarm response to the Union with Syria.  \nFollowing Syrian secession in 1962, a Preparatory Committee of the National Congress of Popular Forces was convened in Cairo to prepare for a National Congress to lay down a Charter for National Action. The 1,750-member Congress of representatives from peasant, laborer, professional and occupational associations meets in May to debate the Draft National Charter presented by Nasser. On 30 June, the Congress approves the Charter, which sets up a new political organization, the Arab Socialist Union (ASU) to replace the National Union.  50 per cent of the seats in the ASU are to be filled by farmers and workers.  Elected ASU units are set up in factories, firms, agricultural cooperatives, ministries and professional syndicates.  \n### Yemen War  \nIn 1962, Egypt became involved in the civil war in Yemen, supporting the revolutionary regime of Abdullah al-Sallal that had ousted the country's former ruler, Imam Badr, and declared a republic. This proved to be a considerable financial and military burden on Egypt and created antipathy toward Saudi Arabia, which supported the Yemeni loyalists.  \nNasser in 1962  \n### 1967 War  \nFrom 14 May 1967 Nasser poured his divisions into Sinai Peninsula, near the Israeli border. Under Arab pressure and as a result of rising popular expectations of Arab military might, on 18 May 1967, Nasser asks UN Secretary General U Thant to withdraw the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) stationed on Egypt's side of the border with Israel in Sinai. Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping although Israel repeatedly declared that closure of the Straits of Tiran would be an act of war. King Hussein of Jordan visited Cairo on 30 May, signing a Jordanian-Egyptian defense pact.  \nEgypt planned to attack Israel on 27 May but canceled it in the last minute.  \nOn 5 June, Israeli army forces dealt a crushing blow to Egypt. Seventeen Egyptian airfields were attacked, and most of the Egyptian air force destroyed on the ground leading to the Israeli occupation of the Sinai Peninsula and the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip. Jordan and Syria entered the war on Egypt's side, and Israel reacted and occupied the Jordanian territories of the West Bank and the Syrian Golan Heights. Egypt, Jordan and Syria accepted a UN Security Council ceasefire on 7 June to 10 June.  \nEgypt's defeat in the 1967 War compelled Nasser to resign on 9 June, naming Vice-President Zakaria Mohieddin as his successor. However, he relented following massive popular demonstrations of support. Seven high-ranking officers were tried in the wake of the defeat, including Minister of War Shams Badran. Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces Field-Marshal Abdel-Hakim Amer was arrested and is reported to have committed suicide while in custody in August.  \n## Society  \nPresident Nasser during a televised speech, 1968  \nAt the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich, four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor.  Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school, and most of them being boys. Nearly 75% of the population over ten years of age, and over 90% of all females were illiterate. Nasser's policies changed this. Land reform, the major assets' confiscation programme, the dramatic growth in university education, the creation of a dominating public sector flattened the social curve. From academic year 1953-54 through 1965–66, overall public school enrollments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser.\n\nQuestion: Which event is depicted in Image 2?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Betsy Bakker-Nort  \nBertha \"Betsy\" Bakker-Nort (8 May 187423 May 1946) was a Dutch lawyer and politician who served as a member of the House of Representatives for the Free-thinking Democratic League (VDB) from 1922 to 1942.  \nBorn in Groningen, she became involved with the feminist movement in 1894, joining the Dutch Association for Women's Suffrage (VVVK), where she was mentored by Aletta Jacobs, one of the pioneering activists of the 19th century.  \nAt age 34, Bakker-Nort started studying law at the University of Groningen after realising that fighting for women's rights required a thorough understanding of the law. In the 1922 general election, the first in which women were allowed to vote, she was elected to parliament and became the VDB's first female representative. She was re-elected four times and, during her time in the chamber, mainly argued the case for more women's rights concerning marriage and labour law. She was also active internationally, taking a leading role in preparing the International Woman Suffrage Alliance's actions for the 1930 League of Nations conference on international law. In 1933, she acted as a judge in a counter-trial in London of the arson case of the Reichstag fire.  \nAfter the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940, Bakker-Nort did not return to parliament. From December 1942, she was interned at Westerbork transit camp and Camp Barneveld before the Germans moved her in September 1944 to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Bohemia. She was liberated in June 1945. She died the following year. According to VDB chairman Pieter Oud, Bakker-Nort had accomplished the task Jacobs had given her: leading the women's movement.  \n## Early life  \nBertha \"Betsy\" Nort was born on 8 May 1874 in Groningen, Netherlands, the youngest of four daughters of a non-religious Jewish couple, Joseph Nort and Wilhelmina van der Wijk. Her father, a merchant, died when she was very young. She grew up mostly around women, including two maids. She later said that, as a young girl, it struck her as unfair that her independent mother was not allowed to vote in local council elections, \"yet each man was, no matter how dumb\". After finishing secondary school, she travelled to Sweden to study Scandinavian languages. She translated around 40 Danish, Norwegian and Swedish works, including feminist novels and children's books, into Dutch. She observed that in Scandinavia, a woman's position in society was much better than in the Netherlands.  \n## Activism  \n<image>Bakker-Nort (standing, right) at the International Woman Suffrage Alliance conference held in June 1908 in Amsterdam\nAfter returning to the Netherlands in 1894, Nort became actively involved in the first wave of Dutch feminism. She joined the Dutch Association for Women's Suffrage (VVVK), and helped start its local Groningen chapter. Together with Aletta Jacobs, she went door to door to recruit new members. Jacobs, a fellow Groninger who was 20 years Nort's senior, was the first female student at a Dutch university and was one of the founders of the VVVK. She became Nort's mentor. In his 2007 history of the Free-thinking Democratic League (VDB), Meine Henk Klijnsma wrote that Jacobs likely recruited Nort for the VDB. They went from town to town to advocate for women's rights in speeches. In 1899 Nort started writing about women's issues, drawing upon her Scandinavian experience; her early work was published as columns in the feminist magazine Belang en Recht (\"The Importance of the Law\"). The historian Marianne Braun wrote that this early work showed her calm and determined approach and social-liberal orientation.2013 In 1904, she married Gerrid Bakker, who was a grain merchant, translator, and fellow member of the VVVK, and changed her name to Bakker-Nort. They had no children.  \nIn 1908, at age 34, Bakker-Nort started studying law at the University of Groningen after realising that the fight for women's rights required comprehensive legal knowledge.2013 She said that the husband's marital power was solely based on his ability to vote and elect policymakers. She was the 14th woman to enrol at the University of Groningen. Bakker-Nort finished her degree in 1912. Two years later, she earned a doctorate from the University of Utrecht for her thesis on the legal position of married women across Western Europe. Bakker-Nort was the first woman to earn a doctorate in law at a Dutch university based on a fully-fledged research study. From her comparative study, she concluded that the position of Dutch married women was most unfavourable, not because the laws were that different, but because the Dutch courts interpreted them in a stricter way. Unable to restrict herself to comparisons, she added a reasoned plea for abolishing the part of the marital law that declared married women \"incompetent to act\". As described in the 1838 civil code, the status of married women was legally similar to that of minors and people with severe mental health problems. This meant that married women could not open a bank account, apply for a mortgage or insurance, or sign a labour agreement without their husbands' permission. Similar laws existed in other countries. After completing her thesis Bakker-Nort started to work as a lawyer and attorney, first in Groningen and, from 1930 onwards, in the Hague.2013 She acted as the main legal expert for the VVVK.2013  \nBakker-Nort considered getting women the right to vote to be a principal means to achieve the overhaul of marriage law, a standard view among first wave feminists. She said that getting the vote was essential to make progress on women's issues and that it was a fundamental right for women to have a say in all matters. In 1917 Dutch women obtained the right to stand in elections (passive suffrage), though they could not vote (active suffrage). Bakker-Nort continued to campaign with the VVVK for active suffrage.2013 The women's suffrage campaign was won in 1919, when the women's right to vote became law, instigated by the VDB's Henri Marchant. Once the VVVK had achieved its goal, it changed its name to Association of Women Citizens (VVS) and widened its scope to gain more rights for women. Bakker-Nort co-authored a report for the VVS outlining provisions she thought should be included in a modern marriage law and wrote in a column in its monthly magazine that the old laws, which made married women legally incapacitated, denied them any say over their children and property and thus needed to be reformed. She singled out women's legal status of \"incompetent to act\", calling it humiliating. She joined the Vereniging van vrouwen met hogere opleiding VVAO (VVAO), a more conservative group than the VVVK which did not always appreciate her progressive ideas and, for example, did not include her in their legal committee, despite her expertise.\n\n## Political career  \n### 1918–1924  \n<image>Bakker-Nort was one of seven women elected in the 1922 general election.\nBy 1918, Bakker-Nort was one of two female board members of the VDB, Mien van Itallie-Van Embden being the other. In the 1918 general elections, the VDB reserved two spots for women on their candidate list and assigned them to Bakker-Nort and her mentor Jacobs. Both Bakker-Nort and Jacobs failed to be elected. However, Suze Groeneweg of the Social Democratic Workers' Party did succeed and became the first female member of the House of Representatives.  \nFor the 1922 election, the first one in which women could vote, the VDB decided that a woman should be assigned the second position on its list of candidates, behind Marchant, whose bill had given women the vote. Due to serious illness, Jacobs could not take the position. Instead, it was given to Bakker-Nort, whom Jacobs saw as her successor. The party's election campaign focussed on legal reform, including the abolition of the Senate, the introduction of referendums, and the strengthening of the legal position of women. The VDB retained its five seats, and Bakker-Nort was elected member of the House of Representatives in July 1922 as the party's first female representative. She was one of seven women elected altogether out of 100 members. In her maiden speech, she introduced parliament to her views of the \"scandalous\" marriage law.2013  \nIn her first year, Bakker-Nort introduced a bill for a so-called \"sister-pension\", to entitle sisters who had lived with and looked after widowed brothers to the right to their pension once they died. The bill passed in the House but failed in the Senate.2013 Also, in her first year, she tried to amend the Ruijs de Beerenbrouck government's proposed legislation to make minor changes to the marriage law, proposing more comprehensive reform with equal rights for women. However, the three Christian parties of the coalition government rejected her amendment. Within the VDB, she was a role model for younger female party members Corry Tendeloo and Nancy Zeelenberg.\n\n### 1925–1928  \nIn the run-up to the 1925 election, Bakker-Nort argued the case in parliament against a government bill to allow councils to fire female teachers at state schools once they married, but with the majority of the House being members of Christian parties and opposing this, her arguments to stop the bill failed. Moreover, she considered it morally unacceptable that the state forced women into economic dependency on their husbands, adding that the husband and wife themselves should decide, not the state. Nevertheless, Bakker-Nort was re-elected, and the VDB went from holding five to seven parliamentary seats.  \nSoon after the First De Geer cabinet was formed, Bakker-Nort planned a new bill to reform marriage law. To that end, she created a broader platform and organised a cross-party committee consisting of members of the Liberal State Party, the Democratic Party, and the VDB. She appointed a male, Samuel van Houten, an 89-year-old veteran of Dutch politics, as the committee's president. Throughout 1927, members of the local chapters of the parties involved made and discussed proposals. However, in 1928, Bakker-Nort again made a plea in parliament to end the legal incompetency of married women, but it was rejected by the Christian majority.  \n### 1929–1933  \n<image>The Peace Palace in the Hague\nIn the 1929 election, Bakker-Nort kept her seat and was joined by van Itallie-Van Embden as the second female member of the VDB. At the end of the 1920s, Bakker-Nort was moderately optimistic about the future of women's rights in the Netherlands. While she expressed dismay at the fact that women still were banned from taking up public offices such as judge, notary, or mayor, she observed that women within the Catholic organisations were slowly taking up more feminist viewpoints, and she welcomed the first female member of parliament for any Christian party, Frida Katz. However, her optimism soon disappeared when the Great Depression led to fast-rising unemployment, and married women were fired to make way for male job-seekers. Nevertheless, she said that for the VDB, the economic downturn did not alter the principle of the individual’s right of self-determination, of equal pay for equal work, and of equal rights generally.  \nBakker-Nort took a leading role in preparing the International Woman Suffrage Alliance's actions for the 1930 League of Nations conference on international law. Women from 35 countries were present at the conference at the Peace Palace in the Hague, though they were not formally invited. The Alliance's main focus was nationality law, as, despite decades-long protests against laws that made married women automatically lose their nationality and take on their husbands, in many countries, little progress had been made towards achieving equality.  \nThe women staged protest marches, carrying their national flags and wearing dresses ranging from white (equality) to black (absolutely unequal). The different dress shades symbolically reflected the gap between the nationality law demanded by the Alliance and the law of the land they represented. Bakker-Nort said the black dresses of the Dutch women amidst colourful ones of other nations created a \"rather painful situation\" for the hosts and showed how far behind the Netherlands was, as its laws were \"still based on the obsolete principle of subjection of women to men\". The activists were able to get meetings with the League of Nations delegates but eventually antagonised the conference president so much that he ordered the police to remove the women from the Peace Palace. The Hague Convention resulted in little progress, only preventing women from becoming stateless. Bakker-Nort continued to fight for the right of a married woman to choose to keep her nationality.  \nDuring parliamentary debates on retracting the ban on women being appointed mayor, Bakker-Nort ridiculed those who said women lacked physical power by suggesting that, if required, the minister should organise boxing or wrestling matches to appoint suitable candidates. She also pointed out how female mayors performed flawlessly in neighboring countries. Following a vote, the ban was lifted. In 1931, she introduced a bill to remove restrictions on women being appointed notaries, a cause she had been arguing for as early as 1917 but was voted down.\n<image>The 1933 Reichstag fire\nIn 1933 Bakker-Nort accepted an invitation from German communist leader Willi Münzenberg to travel to London and join an international commission of foreign legal experts participating in a counter-trial of the arson case of the Reichstag fire. Five men, all communists, were about to go on trial in Leipzig, but it was feared the Nazis would not give them a fair trial. So, for one week, Bakker-Nort and the other acting judges went through the evidence and concluded that the defendants were innocent and the Nazis were behind the fire.  \nWhen the Leipzig judge invited committee members to the proceedings in Germany, Bakker-Nort declined. She denied allegations of bias by critics of the counter-trial and explained that she had taken part because the defendants lacked legal support in Germany, as many lawyers who had defended communists had been imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps, deterring others. After the Leipzig trial found one of the defendants, the Dutchman Marinus van der Lubbe, guilty, and the Nazis executed him, Bakker-Nort lamented the unfair trial, particularly the unlawfulness of applying the death penalty based on a law adopted only after the Reichstag fire. She urged the Dutch people to value the freedom and justice that democracy provided and to fight all who aimed to curtail them.\n\n### 1934–1936  \nAs the economic crisis continued, the government intervened in the labour market. Where city councils previously had been allowed to fire female teachers who married, they were now required to do so. This erosion of women's rights was particularly painful for Bakker-Nort because it happened during the Second Colijn cabinet, of which the VDB was one of the coalition parties. She had tried to make the firing of married teachers temporary, but her amendment failed. According to Klijnsma, the VDB had made a mistake in not negotiating the protection of women's rights during the formation of the coalition.  \nAt a parliamentary budget review in 1935, Bakker-Nort condemned Germany's new marriage law, called the German Blood Protection Law, which banned Aryans, a now-obsolete historical race concept describing people of Proto-Indo-European heritage as a racial grouping, from marrying Jews. Both the Netherlands and Germany had signed the 1902 Hague Marriage Convention, which laid out the rules for recognising the validity of international marriages. The new German law caused the Dutch parliament to debate how to apply the rules of the convention to marriages involving German nationals. Bakker-Nort argued that because it was impossible to determine who was Jewish and who was Aryan, the rules of the treaty did not apply, and the Dutch would not have to revoke the convention's agreement. However, she asked Minister Josef van Schaik to revoke it anyway as a sign of protest. Van Schaik agreed with her that the German law would not apply to Dutch Jews but decided not to revoke the agreement.  \n### 1937–1940  \nBakker-Nort c. 1937  \nIn 1937 Bakker-Nort wrote a piece about fascism in the election issue of the VDB's monthly magazine entitled \"Democracy or Dictatorship\", in which she attacked the fascist party the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB) in an unusually sarcastic way. For the 1937 election, the NSB used the image of its leader Anton Mussert and the slogan, \"Without this man, the Netherlands does not have a future.\" Bakker-Nort argued it should say, \"With this man, the Netherlands does not have a future, especially the women.\" The NSB won four seats in parliament, fewer than expected; the VDB retained its six seats and did not return to the new coalition government, the Fourth Colijn cabinet. The election results did not disappoint Bakker-Nort; she said voters had not punished the VDB and had understood why the party had to allow some women's rights to erode. In early 1938 Minister Carl Romme prepared a bill to ban paid work for married women altogether. This rejuvenated the feminists inside the VDB, both in parliament and in the local chapters. They were spurred on by the activities of the VVGS, whose youth committee's president Tendeloo and other feminists such as Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot organised protests across the country. Bakker-Nort said Romme pretended to base his exclusion of married women from the workforce on principle grounds that the husband was the breadwinner and the wife had to look after the family, but illogically did not apply this principle when companies needed the women. The feminists' efforts did not go unrewarded: Romme never introduced his bill. In a later debate on labour issues, Bakker-Nort asked the government to address the widespread sexual harassment to which female factory workers were subjected. In 1939 her husband Gerrid died.2013  \nThe late 1930s saw a rise in antisemitism in the Netherlands. The VDB attacked the NSB for condoning the Nazis' aggression toward German Jews during and following the Kristallnacht. They did, however, argue against the formal banning of the NSB, admitting that in a true democracy, even despicable voices should be allowed to be heard. Bakker-Nort said in 1938, \"We can not allow democracy to be murdered by its adversaries.\" When in early 1940, fear of a German invasion increased, parliament debated a possible new law for treason. According to her, Bakker-Nort argued against the death penalty; traitors should be deported. In May 1940, just days before the German invasion of the Netherlands, Bakker-Nort announced she would not stand again in the 1941 election, leaving it to the next generation. Party members suggested Tendeloo would be a good candidate. Her last day in parliament was 9 May 1940, when she debated the bill for the punishment of treason and espionage. The next day Germany invaded the Netherlands. Within a week, the Dutch were defeated, and the German occupation began. The House and Senate no longer sat, and the occupiers dissolved parliament officially on 25 June 1940.2013 Bakker-Nort had spent eighteen years in the House, addressing parliament mainly on the issues of justice, education, and labour, and for the majority of her stay, was on the Standing Committee for Private and Criminal Law.  \n## Imprisonment  \n<image>\"Work is liberating\" sign in the Theresienstadt concentration camp\nAs the German occupiers started to arrest and deport some Jewish Dutch citizens in the summer of 1940, Bakker-Nort must have felt threatened, according to Klijnsma. She had never belonged to a Jewish denomination and had renounced her Jewishness, but she did value Jewish traditions. In 1942, she was one of the few members of parliament who accepted an offer to resign and take their pension. However, this did not prevent her from being arrested by the Germans and imprisoned in the Westerbork transit camp in the northeast of the Netherlands in December 1942.  \nFollowing an intervention, possibly by VDB leader Dolf Joekes, Bakker-Nort was made part of Plan Frederiks and moved to Camp Barneveld in February 1943; Plan Frederiks was an agreement civil servant Karel Frederiks had made with the occupiers to keep a small group of Dutch Jews in the Netherlands and exclude them from deportation to the concentration camps. However, in April 1944, the Germans moved all Jews from Barneveld back to Westerbork and then in September 1944 onwards to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Bohemia in what is now the Czech Republic. After the defeat of the Germans, Bakker-Nort was found alive at the camp in June 1945 by a Dutch repatriation mission, together with 400 other Dutch survivors. She moved to Utrecht and did not return to parliament. Her seat for the VDB was taken by Tendeloo.\n\n## Death and legacy  \nSilent clip of Betsy Bakker-Nort in 1923  \nBakker-Nort died in Utrecht on 23 May 1946, aged 72. While the national newspaper Algemeen Handelsblad published only a short notice of her death, Tendeloo and former VDB chairman Pieter Oud wrote obituaries. According to Oud, Bakker-Nort had successfully accomplished the task Jacobs had given her: of leading the women's movement. He praised her drive to get women the vote, without the militant aspects of the English suffragettes, and her tireless efforts to reform marital law and labour laws. He urged the country's young women to realise how much they owed to the pioneers of the women's movement, of whom Bakker-Nort was one of the most prominent. In his 1968 memoirs, Oud wrote that her dedication to public office was equal to none and that although he did not consider her oratory skills the best, she quickly became a competent parliamentarian through her high work rate. Her successor Tendeloo was instrumental in ending married women's incompetency to act.  \nBraun wrote in 2013 that in the 21st century, Bakker-Nort is seen as a transition figure who was part of the first wave of feminism in the Netherlands that got women the vote but continued the fight for more rights. Once women's suffrage was achieved, the strength of activism had significantly reduced: member numbers for groups such as the VVS dwindled. The newly acquired right to study at university quickly became standard, and the fight was almost forgotten. Despite the political climate in the 1920s and 1930s being dominated by Christian parties that aimed to reduce women's rights based on their interpretation of the Bible, Bakker-Nort's efforts, in and outside parliament, were relentless.2013  \nIn 2003, many lost papers, notes, photos, pamphlets, and lectures that Bakker-Nort had kept resurfaced. At some point in the 1930s, she donated her documents to the International Archives for the Women's Movement in Amsterdam. The archives also housed personal documents of, among others, Jacobs and Rosa Manus and documents of women's organizations and journal issues. In July 1940, the Germans transported the entire archives to Germany. After the Soviet Red Army took Berlin in 1945, they moved all these stolen materials to Moscow. In 1992, the feminists' materials were identified in the Russian Military State Archives and recorded on microfilm, and ten years later returned to the International Archives of the Women's Movement. A lack of archives or access to them impacts how history is presented and whether women's stories can be uncovered. For example, the retrieval of the IAV records led to new biographies of Jacobs and Manus.2005a  \n## Publications\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately reflects an event or action related to Bakker-Nort's career as described in the accompanying text for the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

This model requires objective, evidence- based and systemic approaches to the development of proposals and solutions, which respond to national or regional necessities and capacities; from a multidimensional perspective.  \n## Organizational structure  \n### Secretariat for Multidimensional Security  \n#### Secretary for Multidimensional Security  \nThe current Secretary for Multidimensional Security at the Organization of American States is Luis Fernando Lima Oliveira. Prior to Mr. Oliveria, the post was held by Nobel Peace Prize nominee and former Attorney General of Guatemala Claudia Paz y Paz Bailey. She was the first woman ever to assume the position of Attorney General in her country and has been invaluable in developing the rule of law and transforming the justice sector.  \n#### The Department of Public Security (DPS)  \nThe DPS works with Member States to develop mechanisms to evaluate and strengthen their institutional capacity to address threats to public security. These efforts focus on the following areas: the strengthening of security legislation, the improvement of law enforcement coordination and practices, the prevention of crime and violence, victim assistance and the social reintegration of convicted criminals.  \nThe Department of Public Security's Director is Paulina do Carmo Arruda Vieira Duarte.  \n#### Executive Secretariat of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD)  \n<image>CICAD was founded by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in 1986, in Guatemala City\nThe Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) is the Western Hemisphere's policy forum for dealing with the drug problem. The CICAD Executive Secretariat supports the Commission by strengthening the human and institutional capabilities and channeling the collective efforts of its member states to reduce the production, trafficking and use of illegal drugs. The Hemispheric Drug Strategy, approved in May 2010, expresses the firm commitment of Member States to deal with the consequences of drug trade, which poses a growing threat to health, economic development, social cohesion, and the rule of law.  \nCICAD was established by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1986. Each member government appoints a high-ranking representative to the Commission, which meets twice a year.  \nCICAD's Executive Secretary is Adam Namm, an American diplomat and former US Ambassador to Ecuador.\n\n#### The Secretariat of the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE)  \n<image>CICTE's programs include border control, cybersecurity, combating terrorism financing, immigration, customs, among others.\nThe main purpose of the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE) is to promote and develop cooperation among Member States to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism, in accordance with the principles of the OAS Charter, with the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism, and with full respect for the sovereignty of states, the rule of law, and international law, including international humanitarian law, international human rights law, and international refugee law.  \nCICTE is composed of all Member States of the OAS and holds one regular session each year as a forum for discussion and decision-making on counter terrorism issues, measures, and cooperation. Member States designate a competent national authority, a principal representative, alternate representatives, and advisors. Member States also appoint one or more National Points of Contact with competence in the field of prevention and elimination of terrorism to serve as the principal liaison among governments of the Member States and with the CICTE Secretariat for developing cooperation programs between them and the CICTE Secretariat.  \nCICTE's Executive Secretary is Alison August Treppel.\n\n#### The Department against Transnational Organized Crime (DTOC)  \nThe function of this department is to provide technical and legislative assistance to Member States belonging to the OAS in the combat against transnational organized crime (TOC). DTOC, specifically, assists States in complying with the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the three Protocols stated therein: trafficking in persons, illicit trafficking of firearms, and illegal smuggling of migrants. The Department also supports States in complying with the Hemispheric Plan of Action against TOC and the Chapultepec Consensus. Among its many functions, the combat against money laundering, is a primary task. The DTOC anti-money laundering program assists States in implementing international standards and regulations in the prevention and fight against money laundering, and its linkages with other organized crimes, such as illicit arms trafficking, illegal smuggling of migrants, and human trafficking.  The GELAVEX forum is the main hemispheric entity by which DTOC helps countries in this endeavor. The forum is composed of two Sub-Working Groups: International Cooperation and Confiscation, and Coordination between Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) and Criminal Investigation Organizations (CIO). Progress from GELAVEX initiatives are several: legislative analysis among States to produce a set of guidelines with respect to money laundering, production of studies of money laundering cases linked to other transnational crimes, production of expert reports, creating a guide for spatial investigations surrounding transnational organized crime cases, and authoring studies on the confiscation of equivalent and mixed property assets. Other lines of action in the combat against transnational organized crime, include the provision of technical assistance when applying research tools and instruments when investigating criminal investigations; combating illicit mining, such as in artisanal gold; and helping implement the Inter-American Convention against the illicit Manufacturing of and trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, explosives, and Other Related Materials (CIFTA).  \n#### Other political bodies with topics related to the Secretariat  \n* Inter-American Defense Board  \n* Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials  \n* Hemispheric Plan Against Transnational Organized Crime  \n* Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism of the Inter-American Commission on Drug Abuse Control  \n* Working Group to Prepare a Regional Strategy to Promote Inter-American Cooperation in Dealing with Criminal Gangs  \n* Technical Group on Transnational Organized Crime  \n* Meeting of National Authorities on Trafficking of Persons  \n* Meeting of Officials Responsible for Penitentiary and Prison Policies  \n* Meeting of Forensic Specialists  \n* Meetings of Expert Groups in Reducing Drug Demand  \n* Meetings of Expert Groups on Money Laundering  \n* Meetings of Expert Groups on Maritime Traffic  \n* Meetings of Expert Groups on Precursor Chemicals  \n* Meetings with Attorneys General  \n* Meetings with Ministers of Justice  \n* Meetings with Ministers of Security  \nFinally, the Secretariat maintains relationships with other agencies and international agencies such as UNODC and the Central American Integration System to carry out its mission.\n\nQuestion: Which organization was founded by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in 1986 in Guatemala City to address the drug problem in the Western Hemisphere?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# 2019 More Europe leadership election  \nThe 2019 More Europe leadership election was a congressional primary election which took place on 25, 26 and 27 January 2019 at Milan to elect the new party leadership and to decide upon the political direction of the party.  \nAfter the result of the 2018 general election, the three parties that cooperated to the electoral joint list agreed to move on and convert the electoral list into a full-fledged party. The main candidates to the Secretary are the former MEP Marco Cappato, current member of the Chamber of Deputies Alessandro Fusacchia and former MEP Benedetto Della Vedova.  \nWith 55.7% of the votes, Benedetto Della Vedova was elected as Secretary of More Europe.  \n## Background  \n### 2018 general election  \n<image>Emma Bonino, More Europe's founder and former leader.\nThe electoral list was launched in November 2017 by two liberal and pro-Europeanist parties, the Italian Radicals, whose leading members included Emma Bonino, Riccardo Magi and Marco Cappato, and the newborn Forza Europa, led by Benedetto Della Vedova, with the goal to take part in the next general election under the leadership of Emma Bonino. Emma Bonino showed off the list's electoral logo, with her name on it, during an interview at Che tempo che fa, an Italian late-night talk show.  \nHowever, in January their alliance with the centre-left was breaking apart due to technical difficulties. The electoral law approved in November 2017 required that the parties that wants to run in the elections and are not supported by any parliamentary group must collect 1,500 signatures for each of the 63 proportional constituencies in which the country has been divided according to the electoral law. However, since the constituencies were published only a few weeks before the elections, for the 2018 elections the number of signatures was reduced to 400, for a total of 25,200 signatures requested. The objection of More Europe concerned the fact that in the form to collect the signatures, they must indicate, along with the candidates in the plurinominal constituencies, all the 348 candidates in the single-member constituencies. The centre-left coalition, however, had not yet reached an agreement for candidates for single-member constituencies, and More Europe believed it was impossible to collect signatures in a few days because they expected that an agreement between the centre-left coalition parties would be reached only in the last days available before the closing of the presentation of candidates, leaving less than a week for the collection of signatures. The Deputy Secretary of the Democratic Party Maurizio Martina has offered to help More Europe to collect signatures within a few days, but Piercamillo Falasca, Secretary of Forza Europa, has declined the proposal explaining that the Democratic Party should ensure \"equal conditions of access to the elections\".  \nHowever, on 4 January Bruno Tabacci, leader of Democratic Centre, a party that had a parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies, announced that his party would be allied with More Europe, exonerating the list from the collection of signatures. The list then announced an agreement with the Democratic Party and its centre-left coalition.  \nThe list ran in the centre-left coalition but they got 2.56% of votes in the Chamber of Deputies, falling short to the threshold of 3% for the proportional seats, but elected three deputies in the single-member constituencies, Riccardo Magi in the constituency of Rome 10, Bruno Tabacci in the constituency of Milan 1, and Alessandro Fusacchia, elected from the Italians abroad in Europe; while in the Senate of the Republic they got 2.37% of votes, electing one senator, Emma Bonino in the constituency of Rome 1.\n\n### The transition to a party  \nAfter the election, the future of More Europe was unclear. The Statute envisaged a deadline for the party at 30 June 2018: if the founding parties could not reach a unanimity agreement by that date, the party would have been dissolved. The leader Emma Bonino, during a press conference held two days after the elections, expressed her wish to continue with the project. However, the founding parties were divided on how to proceed and what would become More Europe. The proposal of Olivier Dupuis of the creation of a federated party was opposed by that of Riccardo Magi, who proposes to make of More Europe a pan-European confederation, maintaining the unanimity system of the founding parties.  \nThen the President of More Europe Gianfranco Spadaccia presented a proposal that foresees a transitional Statute, introduces the role of a Coordinator and the creation of an Executive Council composed by 15 members (5 from each of the founder parties), the direct recruitment of individual citizens as members, a constituent congress to be held before the European elections that establishes the definitive statute. Magi presented a counter-proposal that partially accepted Spadaccia's one, on condition that 6,000 members were reached by 31 May 2019. In collaboration with Magi, Spadaccia makes the final proposal, which is approved unanimously by the three political subjects before the deadline, which provides for the appointment of a coordinator and two deputies and sets the date for the congress for January 2019. On July 14 the Council is officially established and Benedetto Della Vedova is elected as Coordinator, while Bruno Tabacci and Massimiliano Iervolino are elected deputies, and finally, Silvja Manzi is elected administrator. On 8 August More Europe officially opened the individual membership recruitment during a press conference and finally on 15 September the name of Emma Bonino was removed from the electoral logo of More Europe.  \n## Procedure  \nThe new Statute that will come into force starting from the next Congress, after its approval and the approval of the amendments, provides for the election of a Secretary, the Directorate, the Treasurer and the Assembly. The statute that will be approved during the Congress will be federal, but the system of unanimous voting will be put aside. The Assembly must call a new Congress every two years.  \nWith the convocation of the Congress made by the coordinator Della Vedova on 22 December, the Congress officially began. Applications must be filed for the Secretary and for the Assembly by 16 January (while subscriptions from the members last from 13 to 18 January), the former supported by at least one-tenth of the members as of 31 December 2018, 200 members, and up to a maximum of 1,000, the latter supported by at least 50 members, up to a maximum of 70. The candidates to Secretary must also present a list of 10 people who will be elected to the Assembly in case of victory of their Secretary, ensuring the minimum presence of each gender of 30%. The candidate lists for the Assembly must present a top candidate followed by at least five other candidates, once they are validated, each list must have at least 25 candidates, up to a maximum of 60, ensuring the minimum presence of each gender of 30%. Finally, the amendments must be supported by at least 200 members before 18 January.  \nThe signing of the candidates to the Secretary, the lists to the Assembly and the amendments are reserved only to the members of More Europe, who can support only one single candidate or proposal for an office and can subscribe to them from the More Europe website. The election takes place by the vote of those members who are present during the Congress at Milan, and it's not possible to delegate one's vote to others.  \nThe Assembly is composed of 100 members, of which 10 are elected with the list of the Secretary and 90 are elected proportionately by the Congress on the basis of the percentage obtained by the lists that have applied to run for the Assembly. The Treasurer and the Secretary are elected by simple majority voting of the members and their term of office lasts for two years, the President is elected from the Assembly by simple majority voting, while the Directorate is composed of 22 members of the Assembly, the Secretary, the Treasurer, the President of the Assembly, the candidates for Secretary who obtained at least 20% of the votes, the first three elected from the Secretary's list by the Assembly, two members for each of the founding parties (RI, FE and CD), and finally the representatives selected by each of the founding parties, for a maximum limit of 25% of the number of elected members of the Assembly.  \n### Timetable  \n## Campaign  \n<image>A speech from a member of the European Federalist Movement during the Congress.\nThe first one to announce his candidacy was Marco Cappato on 10 December. Secretary and then Treasurer of the Associazione Luca Coscioni, Cappato has been fighting for the legalization of euthanasia in Italy for years. In 2017 he helped Fabiano Antoniani, known as Dj Fabo, a quadriplegic man, to take him to a clinic in Switzerland to practice assisted suicide. Once back in Italy, Cappato denounced himself to the police and in October 2018 the Constitutional Court requested the Parliament to fill the legislative gap within a year. In his program, among the main points, he promoted the cutting of structural funds for EU countries that don't respect human rights, a European mobilization on climate and global warming and the promotion of an EU seat at the UN Security Council.  \nOutgoing Coordinator Benedetto Della Vedova was the other challenger in Congress. President of Forza Europa, coming from the experience of Libertiamo, his candidacy was focused on the concerns of the economic conditions of Italy and the intensification of tensions, hoping for a role of aggregation from the European Union.  \nThe last to express his candidacy was the member of the Chamber of Deputies Alessandro Fusacchia, who proposed a collective leadership in the party, the valorisation of local groups and the promotion of activities through the online exchange of ideas and opinions, exploiting new technologies.\n\n### Radaelli's candidacy  \nOne day before the deadline for submitting nominations as Secretary, Paola Renata Radaelli's candidacy was admitted, managing to collect the 200 subscriptions required to take part at the Congress on 25–27 January. She's the president of the \"Victims National Union\", which aims to harsher penalties against offenders, a position far apart from those of More Europe in defence of prisoners, she supported the League's reform of the self-defence, on his social profiles she published photos with her and Matteo Salvini, leader of the populist and eurosceptic right-wing party of the League, Massimiliano Fedriga and Magdi Cristiano Allam (both right-wing politicians), she ran in 2012 in the municipal elections of Genoa for The Right, a eurosceptic right-wing party, and she joined \"Culture Identity\", a radical right and identitarian study center. The list that supported her candidacy in the Assembly, \"In Europe yes, but not like that\", had as top candidate Gerardo Meridio, national coordinator of Moderates in Revolution, the party of Gianpiero Samorì founded for the primaries of the centre-right of 2012 that were then cancelled. On top of that, the members' increase made believes that there was an attempt to win the Congress by registering other people close to her candidacy. Piercamillo Falasca on his social media claimed that it was a \"hostile takeover\" organized by a \"group of sovereignists\", while Silvja Manzi, administrator of More Europe, confirmed that the members' increase was \"unusual\", promising thorough checks. Marco Cappato then asked the administrator Silvja Manzi to have access to the registration data and to check if they had been paid more registrations with the same credit card. Silvja Manzi actually found out that 191 registrations, including that of Radaelli and Gerardo Meridio, were irregular, resulting in the exclusion of her candidacy and the list linked to her.  \n## Debates  \nThere were three leadership election debates held across Italy during the electoral campaign.  \n## Candidates  \n### Secretary  \n#### Validated  \n#### Invalidated  \n* Paola Renata Radaelli — President of the Victims National Union (2017–present).

The main suspects behind the operation were Bruno Tabacci and the former candidate for mayor of Palermo Fabrizio Ferrandelli, who supported Benedetto Della Vedova at the Congress. Della Vedova initially said he knew nothing, while Tabacci challenged the idea that voters arrived by bus were unaware of what they were voting, claiming the use of buses to make people vote from all over Italy. It was discovered that two of those elected to the Assembly in the Tabacci's list were part of the list (later excluded) of Paola Renata Radaelli.  \nMichele Boldrin, one of the external supporter of Marco Cappato, said that Della Vedova must \"start to be ashamed\", while Emma Bonino, the founder, preferred not to comment on the incident. Then Cappato asked Della Vedova and Fusacchia to make a joint lodge complaint with the authority competent to start inspections if necessary, an initiative welcomed by Ferrandelli, who also asked him to focus on external enemies instead of feeding the internal suspects. However, in a video posted on Facebook, Tabacci accused the Radicals that they did not accept the results of the Congress and the victory of Della Vedova, and he accused Boldrin, de Blasi and Cappato that they had caused the controversy of the buses. Cappato challenged the accusation by saying that he recognized the results of the Congress but did not accept the methods by which it took place. Later, Della Vedova announced his intention to understand what happened during the Congress, without expressing support for the Cappato proposal.  \nThe deputy Alessandro Fusacchia, one of the challengers to the Secretary, asked Della Vedova to investigate the incident, accepting the proposal of Cappato, otherwise, he would have dissolved the party group in the Chamber of Deputies. One week after the Congress, Cappato announces that he no longer wanted to be part of the governing bodies of More Europe, until the case has been cleared, and regretting the silence of the party leaders.\n\nQuestion: Which individual was involved in assisting Fabiano Antoniani, also known as Dj Fabo, with traveling to a clinic in Switzerland for assisted suicide and subsequently denounced themselves to the Italian police?\nChoice list: \nA.

It comprises various disciplines in which sportsmen from the provinces and departments of Pakistan compete against each other. The games are organized by Pakistan Sports Board, Pakistan Olympic Association, and the host province.  \nPakistan Army have dominated the Games throughout their history, having won 28 of the 34 official editions. Lahore has hosted the Games ten times, more than any other city.  \n## History  \nBefore the Independence of Pakistan, the Indian chapter of the Olympic movement was founded in 1924. The founder was Hassan, the first Secretary of the Punjab Olympic Association. Lt. Col. H.L.O. Garrett, vice principal of Government College, Lahore, was the President of the founding body. At the same time, the Indian Olympic Games were organized in Delhi, Calcutta, and Lahore, the then capital of undivided Punjab.  \nThe Games were held every two years from 1924 as Indian Olympic Games and were renamed as National Games when they were first held in Bombay in 1940.  \n### Post-independence  \nAfter the independence of Pakistan, the first National Games were held at Polo Ground, Karachi from 23 to 25 April 1948.

Jaffar, the first President of the Pakistan Olympic Association.  \nSportsmen and officials from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and all the integrated Provincial units of West Pakistan took part in these Games. The total number of athletes was 140. No competitors were, however, invited from any foreign country. Competitions were held in track and field, basketball, boxing, cycling, volleyball, weightlifting, and wrestling.  \nThe overall championship was won by the Punjab contingent.  \n## The Quaid-i-Azam Trophy  \nThe inaugural edition of the National Games was opened by the founder and Governor-General of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He donated a \"Challenge Shield\" from his private funds. The trophy is now named as the \"Quaid-i-Azam Trophy\", and is awarded to the winning team in every edition.  \n## Organization  \nThe National Games are required to be held once in two years leaving those years in which the Olympic Games and Asian Games are scheduled to be held, depending upon the situation in country. The Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) can allow relaxation from the general rule only in exceptional cases or natural calamity.

Smith (admiral)  \nWilliam Ward Smith (February 8, 1888 – May 20, 1966) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A graduate of the Naval Academy and participant of several conflicts, he distinguished himself during World War II as Commander, Cruiser Task Force during the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway in May and June 1942.  \nFollowing his not very successful command of naval forces during the Aleutian Islands campaign, he was relieved of command and transferred to the administrative post as Director, Naval Transportation Service, where he remained for the rest of the War. In May 1946, Smith was appointed Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission and held this assignment until April 1949.  \n## Early career  \nWilliam Ward Smith was born on February 8, 1888, in Newark, New Jersey, the son of farmer Samuel Hamilton Smith and Elizabeth Zelander, and moved as a child with his family to Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey. He graduated from the Springfield High School in June 1905 and earned an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. While at the academy, Smith was nicknamed \"Poco\", which was an abbreviation of \"Pocahontas\" and was given to him by an academy upperclassman, who suggested that his dark complexion and prominent nose showed he was an illegitimate descendant of the famous Native American woman. Smith was also active in track, football and Naval Academy Rifle Team and received badge as Sharpshooter Expert. He was also awarded the Class of 1871 Sword for excellence in practical and theoretical ordnance and gunnery.  \nAmong his classmates were several future admirals including future four-star admirals Alan G. Kirk, Jesse B. Oldendorf; vice admirals Alva D. Bernhard, Levin H. Campbell Jr., Olaf M. Hustvedt, Monroe Kelly, Theodore S. Wilkinson; and rear admirals Howard H. J. Benson, Joel W. Bunkley, Freeland A. Daubin, Sherman S. Kennedy, Benjamin McCandlish, Harold C. Train, Clifford E. Van Hook.  \nSmith graduated third in his class as Passed Midshipman with Bachelor of Science degree on June 4, 1909, and was assigned to the battleship Michigan, operating with the Atlantic Fleet. He took part in the training maneuvers off New England and was transferred to the recently commissioned battleship North Dakota in September 1910. Smith participated in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises, fleet maneuvers, and gunnery drills in the Atlantic and in the Caribbean and took part in a good-will visit to Great Britain and France.  \nOn June 4, 1911, Smith was commissioned Ensign after serving two years at sea required then by law. He was subsequently detached from North Dakota and sent to Wakefield, Massachusetts, where he trained with the Navy Rifle Team. Smith then took part in the National Rifle Matches at Camp Perry, Ohio, and was assigned to the armored monitor Monterey, operating with the Asiatic Station at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay at Olongapo, Philippines. With the outbreak of Chinese revolution, Monterey was ordered to Amoy, China, to protect American interests and several days later to Fuzhou and Shantou with same mission. Smith was a member of the landing parties on each occasion and then returned to Olongapo, where he assumed command of dry dock Dewey.  \nWhile in this capacity, Smith was promoted to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 5, 1914, and assumed command of Hull Division at Subic Bay. He was later transferred to the gunboat Wilmington and took part in patrolling in the Chinese waters, before he was ordered back to the United States in October that year. Smith was assigned back to the battleship North Dakota, where he served in 1910 and subsequently to the battleship Utah operating in the Atlantic.  \nIn July 1915, Smith was ordered to Washington, D.C., where he was assigned to the Office of Naval Communications under Captain William H. G. Bullard. Following the United States' entry into World War I, Smith was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on June 5, 1917, and continued in his service in the Office of Naval Communications until early 1918. He was subsequently ordered to Europe and served successively aboard destroyers Downes and Allen off the coast of Queenstown, Ireland.  \nSmith was later transferred to the staff of Commander, Destroyer Flotillas operating in the European waters and served as Aide to Captain Joseph K. Taussig until the end of War. For his service during the War, Smith was decorated with a Special Letter of Commendation by the Navy Department and Order of Leopold by Belgium. He was also promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant commander.  \n## Interwar period  \nSmith as captain in 1941  \nFollowing his return to the United States in February 1919, Smith assumed command of destroyer Fairfax and commanded her within the patrols along the East coast and in the Caribbean, before he took her to the Azores in May 1919 to take up station as an observer of the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic made by Navy seaplanes. He was transferred to command of destroyer Herbert in October 1920 and resumed his patrol duties along the East coast.  \nIn March 1921, Smith was ordered to the Bureau of Engineering and served under Rear Admiral John K. Robison until August 1923, when he was ordered back for sea duty to command of destroyer Williamson. He led Williamson during the series of gunnery drills off New York City and participated in the maneuvers with the Scouting Fleet. Smith was transferred to the staff of Commander, Scouting Fleet in February 1925 and served as Aide and Flag Secretary to Vice Admiral Josiah S. McKean.  \nSmith remained in that assignment until September 1926, when he was promoted to commander and reported for duty to Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, as Manufacturing officer. By the end of July 1929, he was appointed commanding officer of gunboat Sacramento operating with the Special Service Squadron in Central American Waters. Smith participated in the patrols along the coast of Nicaragua during the protection of American interests there and was commended by the Secretary of the Navy, Charles F. Adams III for salvaging the steamer Heilo, which had run aground at the entrance of Harbor of Corinto and was blocking the entrance to that harbor. He also received Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit with Diploma from President Adolfo Díaz.  \nIn June 1931, Smith was sent back to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and assumed duty as Executive officer for the Commandant of Midshipmen, Henry D. Cooke. While in this capacity, he was co-responsible for the professional development and day-to-day activities of all 4,500 Midshipmen in the Cadet-Brigade. Smith remained in that capacity under following Commandant of Midshipmen, Ralston S. Holmes until June 1934, when he was appointed an Executive officer of cruiser Salt Lake City.  \nFollowing the period of sea duty off the West Coast of the United States, Smith reported as Aide and Fleet Operations officer on the staff of Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet under Admiral Joseph M. Reeves and served in this capacity until June 1936, when he was ordered for his third tour to the Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was subsequently appointed Head of the Department of Mathematics and while in this capacity, he was promoted to captain on March 1, 1937.  \n## World War II  \n<image>Smith (right) confers with Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, (center) and his Operations Officer and Assistant Chief of Staff, Captain Walter S. DeLany (left), at Pearl Harbor, 1941.\n\n<image>At a shipboard awards ceremony, held at Pearl Harbor on June 17, 1942. The officers are (left to right): William L. Calhoun, Frank J. Fletcher, Thomas C. Kinkaid, Smith, Marc A. Mitscher and Robert H. English.\nIn May 1939, Smith assumed command of light cruiser Brooklyn and patrolled the Atlantic along the East Coast of the United States in the opening weeks of the War. The Brooklyn was later transferred to the Pacific and participated in the opening of the Golden Gate International Exposition in February 1940. Smith then commanded his ships during the patrols along the West Coast until February 1941, when he was ordered to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for new assignment.  \nSmith subsequently assumed duty as chief of staff and aide to the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet under Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and served in this capacity at the time of the surprise Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Smith himself was located at his quarters at Fort DeRussy and witnessed the attack on Pacific Fleet ships on Oahu.  \nUnlike Admiral Kimmel, Smith survived personnel changes following the attack and continued under new Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral Chester Nimitz as his Administrative Chief of Staff. He remained in that assignment until January 8, 1942, when he was promoted to the rank of Rear admiral and assumed duty as Commander, Cruiser Task Force Eleven, consisting of cruisers Astoria, Chester and Portland.  \nSmith commanded his ships as the cruiser escort for Task Force 17 centered around aircraft carrier Yorktown and took part in the battles of the Coral Sea in May 1942 and Midway in June that year. The units under his command caused the infliction of heavy damage on attacking Japanese air forces with ultimate success for U.S. forces in these distinctive engagements. Unfortunately the aircraft carrier Yorktown was sunk at Midway on June 7, 1942. For his leadership during that battles, Smith was decorated with Navy Distinguished Service Medal.  \nBy the end of June, Smith assumed command of Cruiser Division 9, comprising heavy cruisers Indianapolis and Louisville. He then sailed to North Pacific, where he was given additional duty as Commander of surface elements of North Pacific Force. He subsequently led his forces during the bombardment of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands and arrived off the island on the beginning of August 1942.  \nSmith subsequently ordered his seaplanes for reconnaissance mission, but all were promptly shot down or driven off by the defending Japanese Rufe seaplane fighters, which then directed Japanese coastal artillery against Smith's force. He then ordered bombardment of Japanese positions at the harbor, but due to dense fog all shells missed the Japanese facilities by half a mile. Smith's displeased superior admiral, Frank J. Fletcher relieved Smith in late 1942 and succeeded him with Charles McMorris.  \nSmith was ordered back to the United States and reported for duty as Director of Naval Transportation Service in Washington, D.C., in January 1943, remaining in that capacity for the next two years and was responsible for the coordination and administration of troop and supply ships. During his tenure, the number of merchant‑type vessels commissioned by and allocated to the Navy increased from 150 to 500. For his service in this capacity, Smith received the Navy Commendation Medal.  \nOn March 6, 1945, Smith was promoted to the temporary rank of Vice admiral and assumed command of Service Force, Pacific Fleet with headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While in this capacity, he was responsible for the Oilers, Gasoline Tankers, Repair Ships, Ammunition Ships, Destroyer Tenders and Submarine tenders of the Pacific Fleet.\n\n## Postwar service  \nFollowing the War, Smith was appointed a member of the General Board of the Navy in February 1946 and three months later was appointed Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission as substitute for Vice admiral Emory S. Land. While in this capacity, Smith was an advocate of strong American merchant marine operated by private enterprise and during his tenure, the contracts on construction of luxury ocean liners, United States, Independence and Constitution and were ordered. Smith was criticized by the U.S. Senate for overpriced contracts and retired in April 1949.  \nIn 1950, Smith was appointed Vice President of Fruehauf Trailer Corporation of Detroit, Michigan, and remained in that capacity until 1956. He was subsequently appointed a President of the United States Naval Academy Alumni Association and served in this capacity for one year.  \nVice Admiral William W. Smith died on May 20, 1966, aged 78, in Bethesda, Maryland, and was buried with full military honors at United States Naval Academy Cemetery at Annapolis, Maryland. His wife, Elizabeth Purdy is buried beside him. They had together one son, William Ward Smith Jr., who graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and retired as a colonel in the United States Army.  \n## Decorations  \nHere is the ribbon bar of Vice Admiral Smith:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following events is associated with the individual named Smith in the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# St Mary Magdalene's Church, Bolney  \nSt Mary Magdalene's Church is an Anglican church in the village of Bolney in Mid Sussex, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex.  The parish church, which is dedicated to Jesus' companion Mary Magdalene, serves a large rural parish centred on a village straddling the ancient London–Brighton road and apparently dates from about 1100, and an older origin has been suggested.  Many structural additions have been made over the centuries—including a tower built solely using the labour of villagers—and at the entrance to the churchyard is a \"magnificent\"  20th-century lychgate made of local materials including Sussex Marble. The church is protected as a Grade I Listed building.  \n## History  \nBolney is on the ancient London–Brighton road about km north of Brighton and km southeast of the market town of Horsham.  The main road now bypasses the village to the east.  Neither a settlement nor a church was recorded in the Domesday survey of 1086.  The parish was first recorded as Bolneya or Bolne in the 13th century, and was one of 12 in the Hundred of Buttinghill in the Rape of Lewes.  Despite the absence of earlier written records, some sources date the present church's origins to about 1100, around the start of the Norman era, and most others attribute it to that period without specifying a date.  One study, however, suggested an earlier construction date based on the design and decoration of the south doorway, which was stated to have little in common with standard Norman work: comparisons were drawn instead with similar Saxon doorways at 8th- to 11th-century churches elsewhere in England and at nearby Wivelsfield.  \nThe 16th-century tower was erected solely by the efforts of villagers.  \nThe church was built on hilly ground overlooking Bolney from the south, and was reached by a twitten (a narrow lane) from the village street.  The core of the Norman building consisted of a nave, a narrower chancel set at an angle, one window in the east wall and the doorway in the south wall of the nave.  To this was added the main east window in the end of the chancel—a large traceried window dating from about 1300.  The south wall of the chancel has a window of a similar date, and on the same wall is a 13th-century piscina.  \nThe next structural alteration, a west tower that \"dominates the church\", came in 1536–38: the date is known precisely because details of costs and progress were recorded in the churchwarden's record book, which still exists.  The churchwarden at the time was John Bolney, also a significant and wealthy landowner in the parish, whose family was long established in the area.  Described as the \"moving spirit\" behind \"an inspired community effort involving the whole village\", he paid for the tower to be built and arranged for dozens of villagers to use their skills and any money they could offer to quarry the sandstone, cut and shape it, build temporary bridges and paths to transport the material to the church, build tools and wooden scaffolding, and erect the adj=on tall, adj=on structure at the west end of the church.  The project was completed in 1538, and a new west doorway was inserted below John Bolney's coat of arms and the commemorative wording This Stepl is 66 Foot high.  \n<image>The oak and Sussex Marble lychgate dates from 1905.\nThe church continued to expand as the congregation grew.  A west gallery for choristers was inserted in 1670—an early example of the practice, common in Sussex, of building accommodation for a choir at the west end of a church so the congregation could face them when they sang.  Organs were sometimes too expensive for churches to buy, so choral music by local singers was often preferred instead.  West-end galleries only became prevalent in Sussex churches in the early 18th century, though.  A porch was built on the south side in 1718, enclosing the Saxon/Norman doorway; and as part of a Victorian restoration, the capacity was increased in 1853 when the nave was extended with a north aisle.  A clock was added to the tower in 1898 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.  A vestry was added in 1912, and general work was carried out in the nave and chancel during the 1930s.  A modern stained glass window by prolific Sussex-based firm Cox & Barnard was inserted in the south aisle in 1982; it depicts a rural scene.  \nThe Huth family were important in church life in the 19th and 20th centuries.  Henry Huth was a bibliophile whose enormous collection of rare books was sold for £300,000 in 1910 (£ in ).df=y  He lived in an extravagant château-style 1870s house called Wykehurst Place in the parish, and was buried in the churchyard after his death in 1878.  In 1905, his son Edward gave the church a large, \"magnificent\" lychgate constructed from local materials: oak, millstones from a mill in the parish, Sussex Marble (a locally quarried limestone) and a Horsham Stone slab roof.  It stands at the end of the twitten leading to the churchyard, which has been left slightly overgrown to conserve wildlife.  A mid-19th-century rector planted the churchyard and rectory grounds with a wide range of trees, many of which survive—including Bhutan pines and oaks from Somerset.   There are many Victorian tombs and grave-markers in the churchyard, including some rare wooden grave-boards and some with wooden cross-pieces set between stone balls.  Another of Huth's sons, Alfred Henry Huth—who also became a book-collector and author, and who died in 1910—is commemorated by a memorial tablet inside the church; its style was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \"neo-late 17th-century\".\n\n## Architecture  \nThe south porch was added in 1718.  \nThe church consists of a nave, an angled chancel offset slightly towards the north, a adj=on tower at the west end, a north aisle,  separated from the nave by a three-bay pointed-arched arcade, a vestry on the north side and an entrance porch on the south side.  There are other entrances in the base of the tower and its stair-turret.  The nave is m long and m wide; the chancel measures m and has walls of m thickness.  They are separated by a chancel arch.  The walls are of rubble laid in courses with sandstone dressings, except for the tower (which is ashlar) and the Victorian north aisle, whose walls are in the style of crazy paving.  The east windows in the chancel and north aisle have y-tracery, and a small oculus is set below the gable of the chancel wall above the main window.  The roof is tiled with Horsham Stone.  \nThe two-stage tower has mouldings defining its upper and lower stages, and stands on a moulded plinth.  Diagonal corner buttresses provide support.  A stair-turret topped with a parapet is attached on the north side.  The tower itself terminates in a squared-off parapet with \"heavy\" pinnacles which Nikolaus Pevsner considered to be 17th-century.  They are topped by tapering finials with weather vanes.  Above the Perpendicular Gothic west doorway, which has \"nicely carved\" and moulded spandrels and a four-centred arch, are John Bolney's coat of arms (whose heraldic description is Or a crescent with two molets gules in the chief) and the inscription This Stepl is 66 Foot high which was added in 1538 upon completion of the tower.  A peal of eight bells is set in a bell-chamber near the top of the tower, lit by four two-light, flat-arched windows.  The church is well known for this large complement of bells and the regular bellringing that takes place, and the ancient pub opposite the church is named The Eight Bells in recognition of this.  \nThis war memorial plaque bears the name of Captain A Huth.  \nThe south doorway, described as the \"best\" and \"most interesting architectural feature\" of the church, is narrow, tall and surrounded by bands of characteristically Norman reeding similar to the style of nearby St Peter and St John the Baptist's Church in Wivelsfield.  It has a splayed inner archway with re-cut imposts.  Nine voussoirs make up the arch.  The dimensions on the inside are cm wide, m high to the top of the arch and cm deep.  The \"extremely interesting\" decoration on the exterior consists of carved v-shapes (not identical to standard Norman chevron ornamentation) with inward- and outward-facing points at various intervals.  \nA common feature on the south side of ancient churches was a mass dial—a type of sundial that served as a \"do-it-yourself clock\".  They consisted of circular markings engraved in a wall, with lines dividing the hours and a hole in which to place a gnomon or stick.  At Bolney there is one scratched into a stone dressing on the southeast side of the nave, and another on the jamb of the south doorway.  A large 19th-century sundial is also situated in the gable of the south porch.  \nInside, there are various plaques and stained glass windows commemorating former parishioners; the coat of arms of Queen Anne, painted on a wooden panel above the chancel arch (a \"strangely numerous feature in Sussex\", such decorations are uncommon in England as a whole); 17th-century and more recent oak panelling in the sanctuary; and a 20th-century font.  \n## The church today  \n<image>East window by Burlison and Grylls, c. 1905\nSt Mary Magdalene's Church was designated a Grade I Listed building on 28 October 1957.  \nThe ecclesiastical parish of Bolney covers a large rural area centred on the village and bisected by the A23 and A272 roads.  It extends towards the villages of Cowfold, Twineham and Warninglid.  Regular Eucharistic and prayer services are held on Sundays and weekdays.  \nThe advowson (the right to appoint clergy) was first recorded in 1316, when it was held by a prebendary linked to Chichester Cathedral.  In the 19th century it was taken up by the Bishop of Chichester himself; in 1901 it passed to Edward Huth in exchange for the advowson of Etchingham parish in East Sussex.  Huth, an alumnus of Exeter College, Oxford, passed it to the college in 1929.\n\n\nQuestion: Which feature was donated by Edward Huth to the church in 1905?\nChoice list: \nA.

The song was performed by Canadian actress Cobie Smulders in the role of Robin Scherbatsky, who has a secret past as a teenage Canadian pop star under the stage name Robin Sparkles. A follow-up to \"Let's Go to the Mall\" (2006), \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" was inspired by several 1980s pop ballads. The song was made available for streaming on April 15, 2008, before it appeared in an episode of the same name that aired on April 21. It was released as a single on April 23, and appeared on the soundtrack album How I Met Your Music (2012).  \n\"Sandcastles in the Sand\" is a breakup ballad song about teenage love. The music video was shot at Zuma Beach, California, featuring Tiffany, Alan Thicke, and James Van Der Beek as her love interest. Television and music critics praised the song's humor and compared it to \"Let's Go to the Mall\". It had sold 1,000 digital downloads in the United States as of August 2008, and the music video attracted more than 70,000 views online after 3 days of release. Smulders later reprised the role of Robin Sparkles in \"Glitter\" (2010) and \"P.S. I Love You\" (2013). Thicke and Van Der Beek also returned in multiple episodes.  \n## Background and recording  \nCobie Smulders played Robin Scherbatsky, a devoted broadcast journalist who moves from Canada for a job in New York, in the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother. In season 2's \"Slap Bet\" (2006), the character was revealed to have been a Canadian teen pop star under the stage name Robin Sparkles. That episode featured the song \"Let's Go to the Mall\", which had sold 4,000 digital downloads in the United States as of August 2008, while its music video received more than 300,000 viewers on MySpace and the CBS official website within the 10 days of its TV premiere. Smulders was pleased about the favorable reception towards the song, calling it \"hilarious\".  \n<image>\"Sandcastles in the Sand\" was one of the three original songs written by the creators, Carter Bays and Craig Thomas (pictured), for season 3.\nDuring the production of \"Slap Bet\", creators and executive producers Craig Thomas and Carter Bays had deliberated over the idea of bringing back Robin's musical past in a later season. Thomas revealed that the storyline would mention another song by her that \"wasn't as big a hit\". Bays said that they had to \"somehow build on the storyline or find a new dimension to it,\" and that the song would be \"the perfect way to see another side of Sparkles\". Kourtney Kang, who wrote \"Slap Bet\", had been \"pushing for another Robin Sparkles episode\" and was excited when they got a chance to do it.  \nIn March 2008, Thomas confirmed that there would be an episode featuring Robin Sparkles in season 3, with a B-side song to \"Let's Go to the Mall\". Titled \"Sandcastles in the Sand\", it was one of the three original songs written by Thomas and Bays for season 3, along with \"Ted Mosby is a Jerk\" and \"You Just Got Slapped\". They found the inspiration for \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" from several 1980s pop ballads, particularly Belinda Carlisle's \"Circle in the Sand\" (1988), Debbie Gibson's \"Foolish Beat\" (1988), and Martika's \"Toy Soldiers\" (1989). Smulders spent hours in the recording studio with Thomas, where she changed parts of the audio \"bit by bit\". Thomas noticed her voice became \"raspy\" at nine in the morning. John Swihart, one of the show's composers, advised her to eat a green apple to smoothen it. Thomas and Smulders were pleased with the recording session and the final results. Smulders improvised the line \"I'm on the pill now!\" and it was later added to the song. \"The technology that these studios now have is pretty amazing. Anyone can go in and come out sounding OK, so I have that on my side,\" Smulders said.  \nIn the episode, character Robin Scherbatsky reveals that \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" was a less-successful artistic follow-up to her minor hit \"Let's Go To The Mall\", with both songs released by Dominant Records on an album called Make It Sparkle. It was about her first boyfriend Simon, who led a rock band and had a collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. The couple met while making the music video for the song and broke up behind his van after spending a week and a half together.\n\n## Composition  \nWritten by Bays and Thomas, it is a breakup ballad song with a runtime of 3 minutes and 33 seconds. Lyrically, \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" discusses teenage love. The creators labeled it a \"slow, mournful breakup song\"; Smulders, on the other hand, called it a \"pretty funny\" and \"a love ballad about teen heartbreak\". The song begins with the line, \"Met you at the mall / Didn't know how far I would fall\". She recalls \"the greatest week and a half\" of her life with her love interest: he taught her how to french kiss and they were \"gonna travel the globe / From Alberta to Ontario\". Lines such as \"You're a fool!\", \"Shut up!\", or \"I'm on the pill now!\" can be heard in the background.  \nKelly West of Cinema Blend thought that the song resembles \"every other moany pop-ballad from the 80's\". PopSugar and Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad described it as a \"wistful\", \"touching\", \"overwrought, obviously-written-by-a-16-year-old\" ballad. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly felt that it was a \"heartwrenching B-side\" track, and CBC.ca called it \"campy\". Vlada Gelman of TVLine declared the song a \"temporary foray into semi-serious balladry\". Alyssa Fikse of Uproxx noted similarities from the song to Gibson's power ballad \"Only in My Dreams\" (1986). Fox News interpreted the recording as a \"melodramatic torch song... near and dear to Robin's heart\".  \n## Music video  \n<image>The music video was filmed at Zuma Beach, on the coast of Malibu, California.\nAccording to TV Squad, the show began to enlist more guest stars after the ratings success of \"Ten Sessions\", in which Britney Spears appeared in a cameo role. Writer Greg Malins, who had worked with James Van Der Beek, offered him a role in the episode. In March 2008, it was announced that he agreed to play Simon, Sparkles' love interest. A week later, Tiffany and Alan Thicke confirmed their roles as Sparkles' friend and father, respectively. The creators had asked Tiffany to join the show after studying her videos on YouTube. Thicke was a friend of director Pamela Fryman and had worked with her on Hope & Gloria.  \nThe faux music video for \"Sandcastles in the Sand\", and the 60th episode as a whole, was directed by Fryman. It was filmed at Zuma Beach, on the coast of Malibu, California, a week and a half after its parent episode was shot at the 20th Century Fox soundstage. The crew had to hurry to complete filming before the sun set. Bays wanted the video to show Sparkles' origin story and what she was going through, from the \"one time she loved so fully and gave herself over to her heart and got burned real bad by it.\"  \nThe video begins with Sparkles, wearing a long white dress, walking along the beach while singing about her summer love. It then cuts to Sparkles and Simon frolicking on the beach, in one of several black-and-white flashbacks, with Sparkles wearing her jean jacket from \"Let's Go to the Mall\" with no sleeves. Sparkles' girlfriends appear in schoolgirl uniforms as a form of Greek chorus, lip-synching to the lyrics and jumping ropes. An animation shows a van going across a map from Alberta to Ontario; later, handwritten text reads, \"It was the greatest week and a half of my life...R+S 4EVA.\" As the song's chorus begins, Sparkles writes the lyrics into her diary, sitting at a desk on the beach. In a chair behind her, her father smokes a pipe and reads a newspaper. He wears a sweater vest over a button-down shirt, which Eric Goldman of IGN compared to Thicke's appearance in his 1985–1992 sitcom Growing Pains. There is a sandcastle with a small Canadian flag on top, and they are surrounded by other furnishings, a grandfather clock and a spinning globe. Robin's sidekick from the \"Let's Go to the Mall\" video, the Omnibot 2000, arrives with flowers to cheer up Sparkles.\n\n## Release  \n\"Sandcastles in the Sand\" appeared in an episode of the same name that aired on April 21, 2008. The song was fully made available for streaming on April 15 on the official website of Variety. On April 23, it was released as a digital single by 20th Century Fox Records and Fox Music. The song was later included in the compilation album How I Met Your Music (2012). The video premiered online on April 18; brief clips had been posted on MySpace three days earlier. Similar to \"Let's Go to the Mall\", only portions of the video were shown in its parent episode. The full four-minute footage became available on MySpace and CBS.com after its TV premiere; there was a tag at the end of the episode that encouraged viewers to watch the full video online. It was also included in the show's season 3 DVD release.  \n\"Sandcastles in the Sand\" garnered generally positive reviews from both television and music critics. Fox News called it a \"worthy follow-up\" to \"Let's Go to the Mall\". Writing in 2011, Gelman felt that it did not live up to \"Let's Go to the Mall\", but that the video's casting compensated for any weaknesses of the song. TVLine placed it in a tie for fourth place among the show's \"Best Song and Dance Moments\".  Joel Keller of TV Squad said that it was \"the funniest part\" of a \"full of eighties and nineties goodness\" episode. Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk thought that the video \"totally exploits Robin's Canadian heritage\" and is \"one of the funniest things\" from the show. Mickey O'Connor of TV Guide felt that the song was \"made of crack cocaine, and will be stuck in your head all day.\"  \nFikse found that the storyline solidified Sparkle's status as a \"one-hit wonder\" and the video \"was just as hilarious\" as \"Let's Go to the Mall\". She commended Thicke and Van Der Beek's appearances, which show \"how absurdly behind Canada was with its pop culture\". Michelle Zoromski of IGN also praised their cameo performances, and cited the \"splendid\" song to be a highlight of the \"notch up\" episode. PopSugar said that the video \"has a great, dated vibe, with a dose of Heidi Montag beach video and an amazingly awkward Dawson-related make-out scene\", and compared it with Wilson Phillips' \"Hold On\" (1990). Writing about its online promotion, Liz Shannon Miller of Gigaom felt that it was \"a great example of... understanding and incorporating\" offline media through online video.\"  \nThe \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" episode received a 3/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic and attracted 8.45 million American viewers. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the song has sold 1,000 digital downloads in the United States as of August 2008. Meanwhile, its music video garnered almost 70,000 views online over the first 3 days of release. An instrumental version of \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" can be heard when Scherbatsky walks down the aisle in season 9's \"The End of the Aisle\".  \n## Release history\n\nQuestion: Where was the music video for \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" filmed?\nChoice list: \nA.

He served many times as the legate to Perugia and was both a Senator of Milan and ran the archdiocese from 1485-1488.\n\n## Biography  \nGiovanni Arcimboldi was born in Parma or Milan in 1421 or 1426. He was the son of Nicolò Arcimboldo (maestro delle Entrate Straordinarie of Filippo Maria Visconti) and his wife Orsina Canossa (descendant of the family of Matilda of Tuscany).  \nHe was educated at the University of Pavia, receiving a doctorate of both laws in 1458. He also studied letters under Italian Renaissance humanist Francesco Filelfo and later maintained a correspondence with Filelfo.  \nEarly in his life, he married Briseide Pietrasanta, and had a daughter, Briseide Arcimboldi. He also later fathered nine illegitimate children.  \nIn July 1458, through the influence of Francesco I Sforza, he gained admission to Milan's prestigious Collegio di Giureconsulti. He afterwards became a Senator of the Duchy of Milan. Francesco I Sforza sent Arcimboldi to Rome as his ambassador to the Holy See.  \nAfter the death of his wife, Arcimboldi entered the ecclesiastical state.  He received the four minor orders in September 1461. On September 20, 1466, he was ordained as a subdeacon by the suffragan bishop of Milan. In October 1466, Pope Paul II made him a protonotary apostolic. He also became a canon of Pavia Cathedral and Piacenza Cathedral at this time.  \nOn November 20, 1468, he was elected Bishop of Novara. He took possession of the see in May 1469, but stayed there only a few days before he was called away by Galeazzo Maria Sforza to serve as his ambassador to Pope Sixtus IV, a post he held from May 1472 until February 1473.  \nIn the consistory of May 7, 1473, Pope Sixtus IV made Arcimboldi a cardinal priest. He received the titular church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo on May 17, 1473. He entered Rome on November 24, 1473 and received the red hat on December 10, 1473. The pope then named him Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, an office he held until his death. On May 31, 1476, he was elected temporary Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals in the absence of Cardinal Jacopo Piccolomini-Ammannati. He opted for the titular church of Santa Prassede on December 30, 1476.  \nOn January 15, 1477, Pope Sixtus IV named him legate a latare to Perugia. On February 7, 1477, his legation was extended to include the Kingdom of Hungary, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Kingdom of Bohemia.  \nDuring the outbreak of bubonic plague, he again served as temporary Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, from May 19 to June 5, 1482. He was then elected to a full term as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals on January 15, 1483 and held this post until January 19, 1484. On November 15, 1483, Pope Sixtus IV named him legate to Perugia for a second time.  \nFollowing the death of Sixtus IV, Cardinal Arcimboldi participated in the papal conclave of 1484 that elected Pope Innocent VIII. In the consistory of September 23, 1484, Innocent VIII confirmed Arcimboldi's appointment as legate to Perugia, and Arcimboldi left on his legation on October 11, 1484, returning to Rome on January 15, 1485.  \nMeanwhile, on October 25, 1484, he had been transferred to the metropolitan see of Milan. He received the pallium on November 12 and took formal possession of the archdiocese via a procurator, Antonio Griffi, on January 1, 1485.  \nHe died in Rome on October 2, 1488.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Joseph Spear  \nJoseph Spear (died 1837) was an officer of the Royal Navy who served during the American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.  \nSpear joined the Royal Navy during the American War of Independence and soon saw action at several of the largest fleet actions of the war. He was with Rodney's fleet at the relief of Gibraltar, fighting at the capture of the Caracas convoy, the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and then at the capture of a French warship and her convoy. His ship was again in action with a Dutch ship in the Channel, before Spear went out to the West Indies and saw action at the Battle of the Saintes. It was the start of an enduring connection with the Caribbean, where Spear spent the most active part of his career.  \nContinuing in active service during the years of peace, Spear rose to lieutenant and served on a number of ships during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was promoted to commander late in the wars, and was assigned to the West Indies on the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. He commanded several sloops and unrated vessels with distinction, alternating with active service in command of larger ships of the line and frigates during the West Indies Campaign. He fought a particularly fierce action with a superior French force, for which he received plaudits from his commanding officer, and supported the Invasion of Martinique. His reward was to carry despatches to Britain, for which he was promoted to post-captain. Service with the Mediterranean Fleet followed, commanding ships of the line and blockading the French in Toulon. Ill health brought an end to his active service, and he returned to Britain in 1812. He did not live long enough to receive a promotion to flag rank and died in 1837, still a post-captain.  \n## Early life  \nSpear was born in Weymouth, Dorset and entered the Royal Navy in 1779, joining the 74-gun 6 as a midshipman. The Marlborough was commanded at this time by Captain Taylor Penny, also from Weymouth, and a previous acquaintance was probably responsible for Spear obtaining a position on the ship. Marlborough was one of the ships assigned to the fleet under Sir George Brydges Rodney and sent to relieve Gibraltar in early 1780. Spear's ship was in action several times within a few months, firstly at the interception and capture of a convoy of Spanish ships of the Caracas Company on 8 January, and then at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent on 16 January. Marlborough was then detached with a small squadron under Admiral Robert Digby and ordered to escort a convoy to Menorca. While returning to Britain from Gibraltar, Digby's squadron came across the French 64-gun Protée, escorting a fleet of transports bound for Mauritius. The Protée and three transports were duly captured.  \n<image>The Battle of the Saintes, 12 April 1782: surrender of the Ville de Paris by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1783, shows Hood's 6, centre, attacking the French flagship Ville de Paris, right.\nSpear then served in the Western Approaches for the rest of 1780, where Marlborough was again in action at the end of the year, capturing the Dutch 64-gun Prinses Carolina on 30 December 1780. 1781 was spent with the Western squadron, and in January 1782 Spear sailed with his ship for the West Indies with Rodney's fleet. Marlborough was in action at the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, sustaining casualties of three killed and sixteen wounded. Following the British victory at the Saintes, Marlborough sailed to North America with Admiral Hugh Pigot in July, and spent between September and October at New York. She was then active in the blockade of Cap-François for the remainder of the war.  Following the signing and ratification of the Treaty of Paris, the war came to an end and Marlborough sailed back to Britain to be paid off.  Spear left the ship and managed to find further employment in the navy.  \nSpear served first aboard the sloop 6, later transferring to the 64-gun 6 and then to the 74-gun 6. It was while serving on Bellona that Spear received his promotion to lieutenant, on 15 October 1790. He went on to serve on the East Indies station as first-lieutenant of the sloop 6.\n\n## French Revolutionary Wars  \nSpear returned to Britain after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, and received postings to a number of ships. He was first aboard the 74-gun 6, but later transferred to the 28-gun 6. His later ships were the 74-gun 6 and the 50-gun 6. Spear was serving aboard the latter vessel when she was used to carry Caroline of Brunswick from Cuxhaven to Greenwich in March 1795 for her marriage to the Prince of Wales. He then served aboard the 64-gun 6, the flagship of Vice-Admiral George Vandeput at Halifax. Vandeput promoted Spear to his first command, making him master and commander of the sloop HMS Lily in March 1799.  \nHe remained in command of Lily until 1802, when he transferred to 6, a former 44-gun frigate, now armed en flûte, and sailed her back to Britain in February 1803. Britain had been temporarily at peace with France after the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, but with the outbreak of war in March 1803, Spear was ordered back to the West Indies, transporting the second battalion of the Royal Scots from Portsmouth to Barbados in June 1803. He landed the troops successfully in Carlisle Bay, and happened to notice a brig passing by flying Dutch colours. Anticipating that war with the Batavian Republic was imminent, Spear sent his boats out and detained the Dutch ship. Two days later Commodore Samuel Hood arrived with despatches announcing that all Dutch ships were to be seized. Hood thanked Spear for his timely action, and the brig, Vrow Elizabeth, and her cargo of coffee and cotton, were sold for £20,000 in prize money.  \n## Napoleonic Wars  \nWith the resumption of the wars, Spear took an active part in the campaign against French and Dutch possessions in the West Indies. He supported the reductions of Saint Lucia, Tobago, Demerara, Essequibo and Berbice, and afterwards escorted a convoy from Tortola to Britain. After refitting Chichester, Spear returned to the Leeward Islands to serve under the station commander, Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Cochrane appointed him to several temporary acting commands, at first to the 36-gun 6. While commanding the Ethalion he recaptured the British ship Eliza, which had been captured while carrying provisions from Cork to Antigua. Spear was appointed to command the experimental sloop 6 in January 1806.  Spear's command of Dart was briefly interrupted by a further acting commission, this time as captain of Cochrane's flagship, the 74-gun 6. Spear took part in the pursuit of a French squadron in June 1806 which had recently arrived in the Caribbean under Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez, and was again moved from his ship, this time to become acting captain of the 74-gun 6.  \nReturning to command Dart during the second half of 1806, Spear captured the 8-gun schooner privateer Jeune Gabriella on 9 November 1806, and also recaptured a brig bound from Halifax to Trinidad with a cargo of fish. Dart was sailing in company with the sloop 6 during these events. Spear was transferred to take command of the sloop 6 in 1807, and continued to operate with success against privateers, capturing the 5-gun Nouvelle Entreprise on 27 December 1807. He also captured the Spanish packet ship Firmeza during his time with Nimrod.  \n### Goree vs Pylade and Palinure  \nIn early 1808 Spear was transferred to take command of the sloop HMS Goree, aboard which he continued in the West Indies. While lying at anchor off Marie-Galante on 22 April 1808, two brigs were spotted sailing northwards. Spear determined that they were enemies after they made no response to his private signal, and set off in pursuit. The two brigs, mounting 16 guns each and so constituting the superior force, hauled up and fired on Goree, badly damaging her sails and rigging, and disabling her. They were then forced to flee when another British ship, the 14-gun 6 arrived on the scene. Goree had one man killed and four wounded in the brief engagement, while the two brigs had combined losses of eight killed and twenty-one wounded. The brigs were later discovered to be the French Pylade and Palinure. Palinure was later captured, causing Sir Alexander Cochrane to write in his report  \"the last of the two Palinure which were so gallantly beaten by His Majesty's sloop Goree.\" On his return to Marie-Galante Spear came ashore to be received by the entire garrison drawn up presenting arms, drums playing a march and fifes playing \"Rule, Britannia!\" Cochrane wrote a personal letter to Spear saying \"I am sorry that the spirit and gallantry displayed by yourself, officers, and crew, did not meet with the success which you all so evidently deserved\". Though the action was unsuccessful and therefore not gazetted, the Admiralty acknowledged Spear's deed by confirming the appointment of his acting second-lieutenant Thomas Clack.  \nSpear was then to have transferred from Goree to the sloop 6, pursuant to orders brought out by Commander George Alfred Crofton. Crofton was to supersede Spear in command of Goree, but Crofton observed that \"as a battle often caused officers and men to become more strongly attached to each other, Captain Spear would probably wish to continue in the Goree; in which case he himself had no objection whatever to take the Fawn\". Cochrane approved the gesture, writing out two commissions for Spear and Crofton, leaving the names of the ships blank to allow them to come to a mutual agreement. Spear chose to remain with Goree and Crofton instead took command of Fawn.  \nGoree, with Spear still in command, made one more important capture in 1808, taking the eight-gun privateer General Villaret on 24 November. General Villaret was carrying a cargo of sugar, coffee and cotton at the time of her capture. Spear then assisted in the Invasion of Martinique in early 1809, and was given the honour of carrying Cochrane's despatches back to London, with Cochrane's instructions to the Lords of the Admiralty to apply to Spear for more information, describing him as \"an old and deserving commander\". He arrived on 12 April 1809 and was promptly promoted to post-captain the following day.  \n## Captaincy  \nSpear received his first appointment as a post-captain in April 1810, when he was given command of the 100-gun 6. He commanded her in the Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, maintaining the blockade of Toulon. In March 1811 he was appointed to command the 98-gun 6, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Francis Pickmore, and for the most part the blockade was uneventful. Though possessing a powerful fleet, the French commander avoided any contact with the blockading force and stayed in port, or else made very short voyages, returning to the harbour when the British appeared.  \n<image>The Mediterranean Fleet blockading Toulon, an 1830 painting by Thomas Luny\nTemeraires one brush with the French during this period came on 13 August 1811. Having received orders to sail to Menorca, Spear attempted to tack out of Hyères Bay. As he tried to do so, the wind fell away, leaving Temeraire becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. The most serious casualty was her master, Robert Duncan, who had one of his legs shot off as he stood talking to Spear. Temeraires boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, she was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Spear was one of those badly affected, and the commander in chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Sir Edward Pellew, ordered him back to Britain with his ship. Health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic. Spear was to have commanded Temeraires replacement in the Mediterranean, the 100-gun 6, but his ill health prevented this.\n\n## Family and later life  \nDespite his eventful career, his low position on the seniority lists meant that Spear never lived to be promoted to flag rank. He died in 1837, still a post-captain. He had been twice married, marrying his first wife Grace Grant, a descendant of Charles Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aboyne, in 1809. After her death he married Grace Grant, a cousin of his first wife.\n\nQuestion: Which naval battle is depicted in the first image provided?\nChoice list: \nA. The Battle of Trafalgar\nB.

Pitz commissioned for the Smithsonian exhibit at the Century of Progress exposition (1933–1934)\nHenry Clarence Pitz (June 16, 1895 – November 26, 1976) was an American artist, illustrator, editor, author, and teacher who wrote and/or illustrated over 160 books, and dozens of magazine covers and articles. His most well-known book is The Brandywine Tradition (1968).\n\n## Life and career  \nPitz was born in Philadelphia in 1895. His father was a bookbinder who immigrated from Germany. Pitz graduated from West Philadelphia High School and was awarded a scholarship to the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art. There Pitz studied illustration and became particularly fond of the work of Howard Pyle. One of  Pitz's instructors at the Museum School was Thornton Oakley, who had been a student of Pyle.  \nHe enlisted in the United States Army Medical Corps in 1917 and became an x-ray technician. He was assigned to Base Camp 56, Allerey, France, assisting Colonel Coates, the unit surgeon. After the war, he returned to Philadelphia. There he began a career of teaching and book illustration, his first notable book being Early American Costume, published by The Century Company of New York.  \nIn 1935, Pitz married Mary \"Molly\" Wheeler Wood. They remained married until his death in 1976. In 1988, she wrote a short summary of his life, now available online.  \nIn the 1930s Pitz joined the monthly magazine American Artist as an associate editor and writer. He was a regular contributor to the magazine for the rest of his life. In 1950 Pitz was elected to the National Academy of Design.  \nIn the 1960s Pitz was commissioned by Houghton, Mifflin and Company to write The Brandywine Tradition, which remained on the best seller list for ten weeks. A few years later, in 1975, Pitz published a comprehensive book on his favorite illustrator, Howard Pyle.  \nHenry Clarence Pitz died at his home in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, on November 26, 1976, after working on a painting the day before.  \n## Partial bibliography  \n<image>Faery MagicIllustration and poem in St. Nicholas magazine, June 1921\nThe following is a partial list of published works by Pitz:  \n* A Treasury of American Book Illustration (editor).

He was born on 6 September 1870 in Ljungsarp and died in Strömstad on 27 December 1953 at the age of eighty-three. A native of Västergötland, he had a dental practice in Strömstad in Bohuslän, where he met the composer David Hellström.  \nSvenning wrote most of his song lyrics in collaboration with Hellström although he worked with Theodor Pinet on the well-known Bondvals (Farmer waltz).  Pinet, a popular bandleader and composer, was known as the “Boston King” because of his association with the Boston waltz, a dance popular in Sweden in the early 1900s.  \nIn 1911 Svenning published a collection of verse entitled Skärgårdssånger (Archipelago songs).\n\n## David Hellström  \nDavid Hellström was a Swedish composer from the province of Bohuslän. He was born on 23 September 1883 in Strömstad and died there on 7 April 1965 at the age of eighty-one. As a young man he enlisted in the Royal Bohuslän Regiment, where he studied music and played the French horn. He returned to civilian life after attaining the rank of sergeant and from then on worked as a gardener.  \nAfter leaving the military Hellström continued with his musical activities, composing both waltzes and marches. He often worked with lyricist Göran Svenning. In 1907 the two men submitted Kostervalsen in a Bohuslän contest for the province’s best new melody. Their entry was disqualified when the jury ruled it was “too suggestive”. Despite the setback, the partnership endured and produced many memorable songs.  \nIn 1962 David Hellström was awarded the Fred Winter prize for his contributions to Swedish music.  \n## Compositions  \nIn America works by Svenning and Hellström appeared on the Columbia, Edison and Victor labels and were covered by such artists as Arvid Franzen, Lydia Hedberg, Eddie Jahrl, John Lager, Ingeborg Laudon, Eric Olson, Hjalmar Peterson and Charles G. Widdén.  \nThe song Friarevalsen (The suitor’s waltz) was given a second life when the producer Emil Norlander borrowed its melody for his revue \"Tokiga Amelie\" (Crazy Amelie).  Norlander, who was a prolific songwriter, wrote new words for the song and called it Balen på bakgården (The dance in the back yard).  \nIn 1914 Svenning and Hellström wrote Malmö valsen (The Malmö waltz), also known as På Baltiskan (On the Baltic).  The piece commemorated the Baltic Exhibition of 1914 that was held in Malmö, Sweden on the eve of the First World War. Hjalmar Peterson and his wife Olga Lindgren recorded the song in 1917 for Columbia Records.  The same year Charles G. Widdén recorded Sångvals (Song waltz) for Victor Records.  His recording was an adaptation of Malmö valsen. It had Hellström’s melody, some of Svenning’s text and new lyrics that were partly in English.  \n## Songs by Svenning and Hellström  \n<image>The Baltic Exhibition 1914\n* Balen på bakgården / Friarevalsen ~ T: Emil Norlander (1910)  \n* Beväringsvals (1912)  \n* Bondvals ~ M: Theodor Pinet (1909)  \n* Bohuslänska sjömansvalsen (1910)  \n* Brudvalsen  \n* Bröllopsvalsen  \n* Fiskarvals från Bohuslän (1908)  \n* Friarevalsen (1909)  \n* Hjärterövalsen (1915)  \n* I det soliga blå  \n* Kostervalsen (1913)  \n* Kyssvalsen (1914)  \n* Kärestan min  \n* Landsvägstrall  \n* Malmö valsen / På Baltiskan / The Baltic Exposition Waltz (1914)  \n* Midsommarsvalsen  \n* Ny fiskarvals (1912)  \n* Nya Kostervalsen  \n* Stockholmsvalsen (1916)  \n* Sångvals / Malmö valsen / (1917)\n\n\nQuestion: Which waltz was composed by the individual depicted in the first image in collaboration with Theodor Pinet, and is also mentioned in the description of the second image?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# Halsewell (East Indiaman)  \nThe Halsewell was an East Indiaman that was wrecked on 6 January 1786 at the start of a voyage from London to Madras.  She lost her masts in a violent storm in the English Channel, and was driven onto  the rocks below a cliff on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset, England.  The vicar of nearby Worth Matravers recorded the event in his parish register:  \nOf over 240 crew and passengers, only 74 survived.  The shipwreck shocked the nation.  The King visited the scene of the tragedy.  The wreck of the Halsewell was the subject of poems, paintings and an orchestral symphony. Many years later Charles Dickens described the wreck in a short story.  \n## First voyages  \nThe Halsewell was an East-Indiaman of 776 tons (bm), launched in 1778.  She had three decks, a length of ft and a breadth of ft.  \nThroughout her career she was under the command of Captain Richard Pierce.Halsewell 1786 - Wrecksite  \nOn her maiden voyage the Halsewell sailed to Madras and China, leaving Portsmouth on 6 March 1779 and after stopping at Madeira, Gorée and the Cape of Good Hope reached Madras on 18 January 1780.  She then sailed on via Malacca to Whampoa, which she reached on 1 September 1780.  \nOn her return voyage she stopped at Saint Helena on 19 May 1781 and reached the Downs on 20 October 1781.Halsewell 1786 - Wrecksite  \nOn her second voyage the Halsewell left Portsmouth on 11 March 1783, stopped at São Tiago and Johanna and reached Madras on 26 July 1783. The ship returned via Kedgeree, Saugor and Saint Helena, reaching the Downs on 28 August 1784.Halsewell 1786 - Wrecksite  \n## Last voyage  \nEnglish Channel  \nThe Recreation of the Company on board the Halsewell in serene Weather, three Days before their Disolution  \nBefore her last voyage, the Halsewell was considered to be in excellent condition, with an ample and experienced crew.  \nOn 16 November 1785 she dropped down the Thames to Gravesend to take on supplies for her third voyage to the east. At the end of December the passengers boarded at the Hope, including a sizable contingent of soldiers being sent as reinforcements to the East India Company. The passengers included the two daughters of Captain Pierce. Pierce was the oldest of the East India company's captains, and planned to retire after the voyage.  \nThe ship sailed through the Downs on 1 January 1786. The wind died the next day, offshore from the Dunnose headland on the south east of the Isle of Wight, becalming the ship.  \nDuring the afternoon of 2 January a breeze came up from the south, and the ship ran in closer to shore to be able to land the pilot. That evening a snowstorm began and the ship anchored in 18 fathoms of water.  Due to the weather conditions it was not possible to furl all the sails.  On 3 January a violent gale began to blow from east of northeast. The crew cut the anchor cable so the ship could run out to sea. At noon that day they met a brig, who took the pilot, then continued westward down the channel. In the evening the wind increased in strength, now coming from the south.  \nThe gale carried a heavy load of snow.  \nThe crew had to run up most of the sails to avoid being blown on shore. Because she was heeled over, the hawse plugs were washed in and the ship took on large amounts of water on the gun deck.  \nA leak was discovered, with five feet of water in the hold.  The sailors manned all the pumps.  \nIn the morning of 4 January the crew twice tried unsuccessfully to wear the ship. The mizzen-mastA three-masted ship has a fore-mast towards the front, a main mast near the center and the mizzen-mast, usually the shortest of the three, immediately aft of the main-mast. was lost in the process. The leak was too much for the pumps to handle. With seven feet in the hold the ship was near to foundering.  \nThe captain decided to cut away the main mast to reduce the burden.  \nThe fall of the mast carried away five men, who were drowned. The sailors cleared the wreckage and managed to get the ship before the wind. The pumps began to gain on the leak.  \nBy ten in the morning the wind had dropped, and the ship began to roll violently. The foremast was rolled over, destroying the foresail. By eleven the weather had improved and the wind was from the west. Berry Head, the southeast point of Torbay, was seen between six and nine miles distant.  \nThe crew set up a jury main mast and began heading back east towards Portsmouth, spending the rest of the day trying to set up a jury mizzen mast.  \nIn the morning of 5 January the wind began blowing strongly from the south again.  \nAt eight in the evening the Portland lights were observed, from 12 to 15 miles distant in a north of northwest direction.  \nThe crew managed to turn to a westward course, but found that they were running towards shore so changed back to an eastward course, hoping to round Peverel Point and anchor in Studland Bay.  \n## Wreck  \n<image>Loss of the East Indiaman Halsewell by Robert Smirke\nAt eleven in the evening St Alban's Head was sighted about mi to the leeward.  The crew took all the sails in and released the small bower anchor.  After an hour the ship began to drive towards the shore.  They released a sheet anchor, which held for two hours, when the ship again began to drive towards shore. The captain and the chief officer agreed among themselves that the ship was lost, and decided the officers should be asked to reserve the longboat for the ladies and themselves if possible.  \nAt about two on the morning on 6 January the ship struck violently on the rocks, beating upon them and then falling with her broadside facing the shore. The chief officer told the crew to escape over the rocks if they could.  \nThe ship had struck at the foot of a tall and near-vertical cliff near Seacombe, on the Isle of Purbeck, between Peverel point and St. Alban's head. It had run aground at the mouth of a cave yd deep in the base of the cliff, as wide as the length of the ship. Some of the sailors and soldiers managed to escape to flat rocks below the cliff and others to the rocks in the cave. The passengers and officers, numbering almost fifty people, including three black women and two soldiers' wives, took refuge in the round-house (cabin).  \nThis was destroyed when a heavy sea washed over the wreck.  \nThe same wave carried two men who had seized a hen coop onto the rocks, where they were badly bruised but safe.  \nIt took less than an hour for the ship to be dashed to pieces.  \nThe survivors  who had reached the cave faced the extremely difficult task of gaining rocks above the reach of the tide, and then of finding a way to climb along the base of the cliff, then up to safety. A number died in the attempt.  \nThe first to reach the top of the cliff, the cook and the quartermaster, went for help.  \nWorkmen from a nearby quarry came to the aid of the survivors, hauling them up with ropes.  \nThere were further casualties among the exhausted men during this stage.  \nThere were only 74 survivors.  \nThese included five of the ship's officers, forty seamen and twenty-five soldiers.  \nThe surviving sailors had to make their own way back to London on foot.  \nIt was reported that the \"rapacious plunderers on the sea coast... are so devoid of humanity as to strip the bodies of the dead as soon as the waves have thrown them on the shore.\" However, some gentlemen of the area had made sure that the bodies were given a proper burial.\n\n## Reactions  \n<image>Loss of the Halsewell by James Gillray\nKing George III came to view the scene of the wreck with several members of his family.Loss of the Halsewell East-Indiaman UofV  \nThe Dorset poet William Holloway wrote a poem about the royal visit to the spot.  \nAn anonymous poem was published called the \"Monody on the Death of Captain Pierce\".  \nOn 30 January 1786 the Eidophusikon show reopened at Exeter Change in an auditorium that held 200 people, a show that combined pictures with lighting effects and sounds. Opening just three weeks after the tragedy, the new show included an \"exact, awful and tremendous Representation of that lamentable event\".  \nThe show was put on by Philip James de Loutherbourg, a former scenery painter.  \nHenry Meriton and John Rogers, two officers who managed to escape, later published their account of the events.  \nTo commemorate the event, Augustus Frederic Christopher Kollmann composed \"The shipwreck, or the Loss of the East Indiaman Halsewell\", an orchestral symphony.  \nHenry James Pye published a poem that began,  \nPicture from an 1813 account that tries to show all aspects of what happened.  \nIn February 1787 the County Magazine published a poem by George Smith that began,  \nThe wreck was still being discussed fifty years later.  \nThe idea of the father with his two daughters waiting in the roundhouse for their fate,  \nand the scene of the cave below the sheer cliff, added drama to the story.  \nAn 1830 article advocating construction of a breakwater in the Portland Roads between Plymouth and Portsmouth implied that if such a haven had been available, the Halsewell would not have had to make for Portsmouth, and so would not have been wrecked.  \nAn article in The Temperance Tales of 1853 said the wreck \"arose from the drunken desperation of the crew.\"  \nCharles Dickens wrote a short story called \"The Long Voyage\" that recalled the shipwreck, published in 1853.  \nAn 1856 account said that some old people of the region still remembered the wreck, and that sometimes fragments of the ship's timbers and copper were washed ashore or found in the rocks. Many of the ship's guns had been recovered, but more remained at the foot of the cliffs, covered with debris. The mounds of four long graves could still be discerned in a flat area nearby where the cliffs were broken by a small valley formed by an intermittent stream.\n\n## Today  \nHedbury Quarry.

The Allied powers sanctioned and oversaw the planning of the operation and assisted by directing their forces to take over some key locations and moving warships to the Smyrna harbor.  During the landing, a shot was fired on the Greek 1/38 Evzone Regiment and significant violence ensued with Greek troops and Greek citizens of Smyrna participating.  The event became important for creating the three-year-long Greek Occupation of Smyrna and was a major spark for the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922).  \n## Prelude  \nAt the end of World War I (1914–1918) and with the Armistice of Mudros that ended the Ottoman front of World War I, the allies began a series of peace talks focused on the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire.  During Paris Peace Conference, 1919 the Italians landed and took over Antalya and began showing signs of moving troops towards Smyrna. When the Italians left the meeting in protest over other issues, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos pushed a concocted report in the peace negotiations alleging that the Christian populations were under direct threat to convince France and the U.S. to support a Greek takeover of the Aidin Vilayet centered in Smyrna. Borders and terms of the Greek occupation were not decided but in early May 1919, the Allied powers supported Greek troops landing in Smyrna and moved a number of battleships into the area to prepare for the landing.  \nWhile negotiations were still in progress, Venizelos informed Clemenceau of the deterioration of the situation in Aidin Vilayet, where the local governor, Nureddin Pasha, was ordering Muslim groups to commit excesses against the Greek population. The British intelligence was also informed of the deterioration of law and order in the area and the Italian role in provoking this situation. In early May, Venizelos reported instances of Italian–Turkish cooperation to the Supreme Allied Council and requested that Allied vessels should be sent to Smyrna. This request, although initially accepted by the council, was not carried out immediately. Under this context, the British Prime Minister and the Foreign Office were the main supporters of the Greek landing, with the purpose \"to restore public order and forestall the massacres\".  \n### Turkish reactions  \nThe Society for the Defense of Ottoman Rights in Smyrna (İzmir Müdafaa-i Hukuk-ı Osmaniye Cemiyeti) was organized to prepare for the arrival of Greek troops. Nur-ud Din Pasha was appointed governor of the Aidin Vilayet and Aidin Area Command (Aydın Bölge Komutanlığı), and supported activities of the Society for the Defense of Ottoman Rights in Izmir. But he resigned under pressure of the Allied Powers. \"Kambur\" Kurd Ahmed Izzet Pasha was appointed as new governor on March 11, and retired general Ali Nadir Pasha was appointed to the post of military commander on March 22, 1919.  \n### Allied fleet  \nIn the early weeks of May 1919, Allied warships entered the area to prepare for the operation.  British Admiral Somerset Gough-Calthorpe was the primary commander for the operation involving British, U.S, French, Italian, and Greek forces. On May 11, 1919, Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, the Commander of US Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters), came to Izmir from Istanbul on a battleship. The British forces would occupy Karaburun and Uzunada, French forces would occupy Urla and Foça, Greek forces would occupy Yenikale fortress.  \n## The Greek landing  \nGreek troops marching on Izmir's coastal street, May 1919  \n<image>After the skirmishes, in front of the Hotel Great Britain Greek Evzones & Civilians passing through the corpses of the Turkish Civilians.\n\n<image>Article from The New York Times, May 17, 1919\nOn the afternoon of May 11, 1919, the Commander of the 1st Infantry Division of the Hellenic Army, positioned in Kavala, Colonel Nikolaos Zafeiriou, received orders for the operation. The next morning, the landing force, consisting of 13,000 soldiers, as well as auxiliary personnel, 14 transport ships and escorted by 3 British and 4 Greek destroyers, headed to Smyrna. Zafeiriou's order to his soldiers, who learned about their destination only after the departure, was the following:  \nOn May 14, 1919, the Greek mission in Smyrna read a statement announcing that Greek troops would be arriving the next day in the city. Smith reports that this news was \"received with great emotion\" by the Greek population of the city while thousands of Turkish residents gathered in the hill that night lighting fires and beating drums in protest.The night before the landing all the Turks staying as lodgers in the Greek Quarters of the 1st and the 2nd Cordon were massacred along with their families. For that reason none of the Turks dared to approach the Greek quarter in the morning. Therefore the accountants started giving all the 3 monthly payments to the soldiers and the officers to prevent money being stolen by the Greeks. Later, translations of proclamations issued by the Turks during this occasion, showed that the intention was not purely pacific resistance. The same night, several hundred prisoners, mostly Turks, were released from a prison, with the complicity of the Ottoman authorities and Italian major in charge of the prison. Some of them armed purchased arms from a depot near the barracks.  \nThe Greek occupation of Smyrna started the following day, where thousands were gathered on the seafront, waving Greek flags on the docks where the Greek troops were expected to arrive. The Metropolitan of Smyrna, Chrysostomos of Smyrna blessed the first troops as they arrived at 08:00. A colonel, who had neither the will nor the prestige to force himself relentlessly on his men, was in charge of the operation and neither the appointed High Commissioner nor high-ranking military individuals were there for the landing resulting in miscommunication and a breakdown of discipline. Most significantly, this resulted in the 1/38 Evzone Regiment landing north of where they were to take up their post. As a result, they had to march south passing a large part of the Greek crowds celebrating the landing and also the Ottoman government Konak and the barracks of Ottoman troops. A Turk fired a shot (Smith indicates that no one knows who fired the shot) and chaos resulted with the Greek troops firing multiple shots into the Konak and the barracks. The Ottoman troops surrendered and the Greek regiment begun marching them up the coast to a ship to serve as a temporary prison. Allied officers in the harbor reported seeing Greek troops bayoneting multiple Turkish prisoners during the march and then saw them thrown into the sea. Prisoners were forced to shout \"Long live Venizelos!\" and \"Long live Greece!\".The ones who did not shout like Colonel Süleyman Fethi Bey or Pharmacist Captain Ahmet Bey, the uncle-in-law of Fahrettin Altay and many others like the journalist Hasan Tahsin were martyred with bayonets.  Donald Whittall, a British citizen and one of the few neutral observers during the landing, remarked about the treatment of Turkish prisoners, \"They were made to go through no humiliation and received a good deal\". But Whittall estimated that thirty unarmed prisoners were slaughtered.  The captain of 6 reported that a Turkish officer, marching with his hands up, veered out of line. He was hit by a Greek soldier's rifle butt on the back of his head. When he tried to stand up he was hit again and bayoneted, before the top of his head was blown off.This claim was also verified by first-lieutenant Zekai Kaur, a Cretan Turk who was made a prisoner and put into the Greek transatlantic ship \"Patris\", on 15th of May 1919 and was among the prisoner column in the streets until they reached the cargo deck of the prisoner ship. He saw many among his column being pulled away, beaten, wounded and being killed where stopping meant death. While 2 Greek journalists were searching & shouting for him to take revenge on Kaur being a Greek-speaking officer in the Censorship Bureau. Kaur saw that a \"bulky\" priest, Chrysostomos of Smyrna, with a cross in one hand and a knife in the other executed a Turkish soldier in front of the Greek civilian crowd cheering in Cafe Foti (Klonaridis).  \nViolence and disorder followed the landing and Greek troops and Greek citizens of Smyrna participated in these actions. Some shops belonging to Jews were also plundered by Greek soldiers. For the days following the landing, Greek troops arbitrarily detained around 2,500 people. Looting of Turkish houses in the city and in the surrounding areas began on the night of May 15 and continued for many days after that. The Inter-Allied Commission of Inquiry reported that:  \nDead bodies of Turkish civilians being dragged in the wet street to the cart, while Greek & other civilians watch in front of the Hotel Great Britain.  \nA photo of the Greek landing  \nGreek troops loading artillery  \nAdmiral Calthorpe left the area on May 21 and on May 23, the Greek commander in the area went against orders issued by the Allies and Venizelos by ordering the expansion of military operations in Aydın and Şuhut. These operations initially did not face significant resistance, but ethnic violence erupted along the way leading to significant violence and chaos; particularly in the Battle of Aydın from May 27 until June 27, 1919.  In many areas, Greek forces demobilized the Ottoman police and then left the area resulting in Turkish mobs looting Greek property and killing Greek citizens. This was retaliation for atrocities committed by Greek soldiers and civilians in Smyrna and the surrounding area against Turks.  \nWhen the atrocities were exposed and condemned by the British House of Commons on 26 June, Venizelos faced British diplomatic pressure to conduct an official inquiry.  \nCourt martial on August 15, 1919 led by the Greek High Commissioner for the violence on May 15 and May 16 pronounced 74 convictions (including 48 Greeks, 13 Turks, 12 Armenians and one Jew).  \nAccording to the Inter-Allied Commission of Inquiry, the casualties on 15 May were as follows: Greek army (2 killed, 6 wounded); 100 Greek civilians (20 killed, 20 drowned, 60 wounded); 300-400 Turkish civilians killed or wounded.  \nEyewitnesses in Smyrna reported higher civilian casualties among the Turks. The U.S. Naval Officer of the 6, which was berthed at Smyrna harbor, estimated 300-500 Turks killed with a total of 700-1000 casualties. Regarding the Greek casualties, he estimated 2 killed and 15-20 wounded soldiers, 20-30 killed and 40-50 wounded civilians Reverend Alexander MacLachlan, a Canadian in charge of the international college at Smyrna, estimated 500 Turks killed in his \"Statement of an Eyewitness\". He however mentions that his estimate on the evening of the landing was inaccurate and stated that if he made his statement a week later he would have given 800-1000 Turks killed only in the center of Smyrna on the first day. The estimates were far lower than the actual numbers as they did not count the dead thrown into sea. MacLachlan stated that:  \nMacLachlan's claim is also verified by Kaur. Many naked bodies of the Turks everyday on the following days were washed up on the shores of İzmir some of these were Turkish Military Personnel and Civilians who were huddled in to the prisoner ship \"Patris\". Zekai Kaur being a prisoner on the ship states that the officers were put into the ship's hold full of artillery carrier animals' dungs and after the visit and the protest of a Scottish officer they were put to the upper decks. During their imprisonement Greeks threw overboard and drowned anyone who went up to get air. These bodies also hit the shore days later due to tide in the sea. The revend also states that many local Armenians and Jews were also \"victims of that day and night of terror\" and that he saw the bodies of a Jewish lad and the father of an Armenian student of his, since they were mistaken by the Greek soldiers and Greek locals as being Turks since some of them were wearing fez, which was attributed to being Turkish.\n\n## Impacts  \n<image>1921 illustration by it depicting the landing at Smyrna\nThe Greek army from the first started showing the signs that they had not come for a temporary occupation but rather for a permanent annexation; to incorporate western Anatolia into Greece. This intention was already clear to some Turks after seeing which territories that Greeks had occupied. The Turkish reaction to these developments was anger, resulting in violence in the region. After the initial shock of the landing, Turkish groups started retaliating by committing excesses against the civilian Greek communities residing outside of the occupation zone. While there were large demonstrations against Allied Forces in Istanbul, in Anatolia first armed clash between Turks and Greeks occurred on 28 May at Ödemiş. This was between a small body of Turks and the Greek Army. Afterwards, Turkish guerrilla warfare flared up along the line of Greek advance.  \nIt created the Smyrna Zone that administered the area from 1919 until September 9, 1922. After the violence in May 1919, many of the allies began to limit their support for the operation: France and Italy all became resistant to permanent Greek occupation and the stillborn Treaty of Sèvres in 1920 gave administrative control of the area to Greece, while Turkey would retain sovereignty, with permanent sovereignty to be decided after 5 years. The landing in Smyrna was sanctioned by article 69 also signed by the grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet VI. On the other hand it fuelled the Turkish nationalist movement under Mustafa Kemal and large scale atrocities against the Pontic Greek population in Eastern Anatolia. The Greek occupation ended when Turkish forces entered Smyrna (İzmir) on September 9, 1922.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following events occurred during the Greek occupation of Smyrna in 1919, as depicted or described in the provided images and text?\nChoice list: \nA.

Infanterie-Division) was an infantry division of the German Heer during World War II.  \n## History  \n<image>Ludwigsburg grave of an unknown soldier of the 260th Infantry Division, killed in action in 1942/43\nThe 260th Infantry Division was formed in Karlsruhe (Wehrkreis V) on 26 August 1939, the day of German mobilization, as a division of the fourth Aufstellungswelle. It initially consisted of the Infantry Regiments 460, 470, and 480, which were formed from various replacement battalions. Infantry Regiment 460 was formed from the Replacement Battalions 14 (Weingarten), 56 (Biberach), and 119 (Esslingen), Infantry Regiment 470 from the Replacement Battalions 34 (Heilbronn), 13 (Ludwigsburg), and 35 (Tübingen), and Infantry Regiment 480 from the Replacement Battalions 21 (Nuremberg), 42 (Hof), and 55 (Würzburg). Additionally, the 260th Infantry Division was equipped with the four artillery detachments of Artillery Regiment 260 and the Division Units 260, the later Pioneer Battalion 653. The initial commander of the division was Hans Schmidt.  \nThe division was sent to the Upper Rhine region in October 1939, and spent the Battle of France in the reserves of OKH. It subsequently was placed on occupation duty in France and remained there until July 1941.  \nOn 30 January 1940, the division passed an infantry battalion and an artillery battery to the 296th Infantry Division of the eighth Aufstellungswelle, and later an additional third of the division's strength to the 125th Infantry Division of the eleventh Aufstellungswelle on 21 October 1940. These transferred units were later replaced with division reservists and fresh recruits.  \nThe 260th Infantry Division joined Operation Barbarossa between July and August 1941, and subsequently fought at Kiev, Babruysk, and Moscow before participating in the defensive operations against the Soviet winter campaign of 1941–42.\n<image>Walther Hahm, twice commander of the 260th Division during 1942/43 (photographed in May 1943).\nOn 1 January 1942, Walther Hahm took command of the division.  \nWalther Hahm during his time as commander of the 260th Division, pictured in the Soviet Union  \nIn 1942, the third battalions of each of the three divisional regiments were dissolved due to casualties, downgrading the division from nine to six battalions across three regiments.\n<image>Dietrich von Choltitz, divisional commander of the 260th Division in mid-to-late 1942.\nBetween May and August 1942, the 260th Infantry Division fought at Spas-Demensk. On 27 August 1942, Dietrich von Choltitz took command of the division. He would hold the post until 6 October, upon which Hahm returned to a second tenure as division commander.  \nIn summer 1943, Grenadier Regiment 470 was dissolved and its two battalions became the third battalions of each of the other regiments, thus shifting the 260th Infantry Division from a division of three regiments with two battalions each to a division of two regiments with three battalions each.  \nBetween September 1943 and May 1944, the 260th Infantry Division took part in the defense of the Mogilev sector. On 9 November 1943, Robert Schlüter took command of the division.  \nIn October 1943, the second battalion of Grenadier Regiment 367 of the 214th Infantry Division in occupied Norway was given to the 260th Infantry Division as Division Fusilier Battalion 260.  \nIn April 1944, the two battalions of the dissolved Grenadier Regiment 470 were taken out of their respective regiments and the Grenadier Regiment 470 redeployed. With the addition of the Division Fusilier Battalion 260 of October 1943, the 260th Infantry Division had thus become a Division neuer Art 44, a division of three regiments of two battalions each that was additionally strengthened by a seventh independent battalion. On 21 April 1944, Alexander Conrady took command of the division, before he was replaced by Günther Klammt on 1 May 1944. Klammt would be the last commander of the 260th Infantry Division.  \nThe 260th Infantry Division was captured and destroyed near Minsk on 9 July 1944.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Ansar (Sudan)  \nThe Ansar (أنصار) are a Sufi religious movement in the Sudan whose followers are disciples of Muhammad Ahmad (12 August 1844 – 22 June 1885), a Sudanese religious leader based on Aba Island who proclaimed himself Mahdi on 29 June 1881. His followers won a series of victories against the Egyptians culminating in the capture of Khartoum in January 1885.  \n<image>Muhammad Ahmad, who inspired the Ansar movement\nWhen Muhammed Ahmad died a few months later, his successor, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, maintained the independence of the Mahdist State until 1898, when an Anglo-Egyptian force re-conquered the area. The Mahdi's eldest surviving son, Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, was the religious and political leader of the Ansar throughout most of the colonial era of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1898–1955) and for a few years after the Sudan gained independence in January 1956. His descendants have led the movement since then.\n\n## History  \n### Mahdiyah  \nMuhammed Ahmad claimed to receive direct inspiration from Allah. After taking power in Sudan between 1883 and 1885, he established the Mahdist regime which was ruled using a modified version of sharia.Ansar of Sudan Muhammed Ahmed appointed three Caliphs or lieutenants: Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, Ali wad Hilu, and his young cousin and son-in-law Muhammad Sharif. He emulated Muhammad, who was followed by the four Rashidun caliphs. Abdillahi corresponded to Abu Bakr, Ali wad Hilu to Umar, and Muhammad Sharif to Ali. Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi was to have taken the place of Uthman, but refused the honor. When the Mahdi died on 22 June 1885 a few months after capturing Khartoum, Abdillahi became head of state, although he had to deal with challenges from members of the Mahdi's family and Muhammad Sharif.  \n#### Followers of the Mahdī  \n<image>A Mahdist Dervish from Sudan (1899)\n\n<image>Mahdist in the Khalifa's House, Omdurman, wearing the distinctive patched uniform worn by the followers of the Mahdī\nTo distinguish his followers from adherents of other Sufi orders, Muhammed Ahmad forbade the use of the word dervish (Arabic darwīsh, pl. darawīsh) to describe his followers, replacing it with the title Anṣār, the term Muhammad used for the people of Medina who welcomed him and his followers after their flight from Mecca.  \"Dervish\" was widely used in the Sudanese context to describe an affiliate of a Sufi denomination or, more specifically, a religious mendicant who chose to reject material wealth. By renaming his followers anṣār, the Mahdī unified his Sufi and non-Sufi followers under one name. Despite the Mahdī's prohibition, British soldiers and government officials continued to use the term to describe the Anṣār throughout the late 1880s and 1890s. It was used in a pejorative sense by British government officials such as Major FR Wingate of British Military Intelligence. On the other hand, British soldiers, in their accounts of the conflicts, often described the Mahdist \"dervishes'\" as brave and fearless and the word came to suggest a sense of respect and wonder in this context.\n\n#### Mahdist state (1885–1898)  \nThe Mahdist State was at first run on military lines as a jihad state, with the courts enforcing Islamic jurisprudence and the precepts of the Mahdi, which had equal force. Later, the Caliph established a more traditional administration. The state was expansionary, and engaged in wars with Ethiopia.  \nIn 1892 General Herbert Kitchener was appointed commander of the Egyptian army. After careful preparations and a slow advance, on 2 September 1898 the main Anglo-Egyptian forces engaged with a Mahdist army of 52,000 at the Battle of Omdurman. With greatly superior firepower, the British won a decisive victory. Caliph Abdillahi fled, and a year later was killed with other Mahdist leaders at the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat (25 November 1899).  \n### Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi (1885–1959)  \nIn 1898, after the fall of the Mahdist State the British government placed restrictions on the movements and activity of the Mahdi's son, Sayyid 'Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi. However, he soon emerged as the leader of the Ansar. Throughout most of the colonial era of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the British government considered him important as a moderate leader of the Mahdists.  \nIn the early 1920s, from 5,000–15,000 pilgrims were coming to Aba Island each year to celebrate Ramadan. Many of them identified Abd al-Rahman with the prophet Isa, the Islamic interpretation of Jesus and assumed that he would drive the white Christian colonists out of Sudan. The British government found that Abd al-Rahman was in correspondence with agents and leaders in Nigeria and Cameroon, predicting the eventual victory of the Mahdists over the Christians. They blamed him for unrest in these colonies. After pilgrims from West Africa held mass demonstrations on Aba Island in 1924, the Sayyid was told to put a stop to the pilgrimages.  \nAli al-Mirghani, leader of the Khatmiyya, was often in opposition to Abd al-Rahman and the Ansar. Both of these Sufi movements organized youth groups and supported competing parties in the run-up to independence. The Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 discussed the future of Sudan, among other subjects. The Sudanese were not consulted. Educated Sudanese became increasingly concerned, and the Ansar appealed to many people in this group. The leaders portrayed the Mahdi to them as the first Sudanese nationalist and Abd al-Rahman was to many an attractive leader of the independence movement. In contrast, Ali al-Mirghani and the Khatmiyya became identified with the pro-Egyptian school of thought that favored unity of the Nile Valley.  \nIn August 1944 'Abd al-Rahman met with senior Congress members and tribal leaders to discuss formation of a pro-independence political party that was not associated with Mahdism. In February 1945 the National Umma Party had been organized and the party's first secretary, Abdullah Khalil, applied for a government license. The constitution of the party made no mention of Sayyid 'Abd al-Rahman or of the Ansar. The only visible link to Abd al-Rahman was the party's reliance on him for funding.  \nSayyid 'Abd al-Rahman died in 1959 aged 74. His son, Sadiq al-Mahdi, was imam of the Ansar for the next two years. After his death in 1961, he was succeeded as imam by his brother, Imam al-Hadi al-Mahdi, while al-Sadiq's son, Sadiq al-Mahdi, took over the leadership of the Umma Party.  \n### Sadiq Al-Mahdi (1964–2020)  \nThe National Umma Party of Sudan has generally been associated with the Ansar movement. Sadiq al-Mahdi, the grandson of Abd al-Rahman, was elected president of the Umma party in November 1964.Sadig Al-Mahdi  \n#### Military assault on Aba island (1970)  \nIn November 1969 Gaafar Nimeiry became Prime Minister at the head of a mainly civilian government. Ansar-led conservative forces were opposed to the government, and Imam al-Hadi al-Mahdi withdrew to his base in Aba Island. In March 1970 Nimeiri tried to visit the island to talk with the imam, but was prevented by hostile crowds. Fighting later broke out between government forces opposed by up to 30,000 Ansar. Army units backed up by air support assaulted the island, and about 3,000 people were killed.  \nSadiq Al-Mahdi was arrested in 1970, and for many years alternated between spells in prison in Sudan and periods of exile. In 1985 Sadiq al-Mahdi was again elected president of the Umma party. In the 1986 elections he became Prime Minister of Sudan, holding office until the government was overthrown in 1989. After further imprisonment and exile, Sadiq al-Mahdi returned to Sudan in 2000 and in 2002 was elected Imam of the Ansar. In 2003 Sadiq was re-elected President of Umma.Sadig Al-Mahdi  \n## Beliefs  \nAccording to the hadith, \"no one will more resemble me than al-Mahdi\". It is said that the Mahdi will appear \"after hearts become hard and the earth is filled with wickedness\". Following him, the Antichrist will appear, with all the accompanying signs that the Hour has come, one of which will be the descent of the Jesus. Sunnis believe that Jesus will slay al-Masih ad-Dajjal or \"the False Messiah\".  \nMuhammed Ahmed revealed himself as \"al-Mahdi al-Muntazar\", \"the awaited guide in the right path\", usually seen as the Mahdi. His mission was to redeem the faithful and to prepare the way for the second coming of the Prophet Isa. His movement was fundamentalist, demanding a return to the early principles of Islam. Men were to abstain from alcohol and tobacco, and women were to be strictly secluded.  \nAhmed taught that warfare was a duty incumbent upon all Muslims rather than the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). The creed was altered to say that \"Muhammad Ahmad is the Mahdi of God and the representative of His Prophet\".Ansar of Sudan Another change was that zakat (almsgiving) became a tax paid to the state.\n\nQuestion: Which term did Muhammed Ahmad use to describe his followers, as mentioned in the descriptions accompanying the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

It was released on June 7, 2005, by Callaway Arts & Entertainment. The book was written for readers aged six and up. The book's titular character is an Italian greyhound who learns the moral \"money can't buy happiness\". Madonna drew from her life when writing the story, from denouncing materialism to her motherhood. Portuguese artist Rui Paes illustrated the book, and modeled his illustrations on Renaissance and Baroque painting, and the works of painter Caravaggio.  \nCallaway hosted a party for the book release at New York's Bergdorf Goodman store, where Madonna read the story aloud. She also made promotional appearances on television talk shows and gave magazine interviews. Lotsa de Casha debuted at number three on The New York Times Best Seller list. It received mixed reviews from book critics, who found some humor in the story, but felt it did not gel with Paes' illustrations, which received positive feedback.  \n## Synopsis  \nIn a distant land lived a wealthy merchant called Lotsa de Casha. He had everything money could buy, however Lotsa was still unhappy. So he sought out the opinion of all the well-known doctors of the land regarding his misery, but failed to find an answer. One day, his driver told him about a wise old man who lived faraway in an ancient city. Lotsa travels to the wise man who explained that the secret to his happiness was in sharing his wealth with others and putting them before himself. Lotsa was stunned since he had always put forth his own needs first, and became skeptical about the man's words.  \nWhile exploring the ancient city, Lotsa saw a man slogging to change the wheel of his car by himself. But Lotsa did not stop to help and continued walking. He soon got lost and was robbed by two thieves who left him penniless. A distraught Lotsa cried for help to a passing driver and realized it was the same man he had seen earlier. The man, who called himself Mister Forfilla, agreed to give him a ride back to his house, but in exchange Lotsa had to work for him. Throughout their journey Forfilla ordered Lotsa de Casha to transport an assortment of things—including chairs, tables, clothing—to people's homes, who all appreciated the gifts. Forfilla explained Lotsa the same thing as the wise man, that sharing his wealth was the key to happiness.  \nOne night as he was driving the carriage, Lotsa was able to put someone else's need before his own by giving his blanket to a beggar who needed it. They finally reached Lotsa's palace and Forfilla confessed that it was his old home before Lotsa had bought it. Lotsa invited Forfilla inside for lunch, being a changed man now.  \n## Background and writing  \n<image>alt=Guy Ritchie in a black shirt speaking while holding a microphone.\nIn 2003, Madonna signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment for a series of five children's books. She explained that each book dealt \"with issues that all children confront... Hopefully there is a lesson that will help kids turn painful or scary situations into learning experiences\". During the promotion of the fourth book in the series, The Adventures of Abdi, Callaway announced the plans of publishing the fifth and final book titled Lotsa de Casha. The press release stated that the characters will be portrayed as animals with the central character, Lotsa de Casha, shown as an Italian greyhound in the style of Aesop's Fables. It was written for readers aged six and up with the moral that \"money can't buy happiness\". Madonna herself described Lotsa de Casha \"as a story that claims that we can all resist selfishness and do something good for ourselves and for others\". She confirmed that all profits gained from the sales of the book would be donated to charity.  \nWith Grazia magazine, Madonna explained that writing Lotsa de Casha was ironic since she felt it was a \"parable of her life\". The story reflected her own journey from being labeled a \"material girl\" to being a mother. Like the titular character—described by the Associated Press as \"a wealthy Scroogelike greyhound\"—the singer felt that she had changed from being materialistic. \"I spent 15 years of my life thinking about myself, thinking about everything from the point of view of: 'What is in it for me?',\" Madonna pondered. Accepting herself as someone \"privileged\", she realized that \"ultimately material things won't bring you happiness. Most very wealthy people are not happy. Why? They have too much of something they don't need, and they don't share it with other people.\" Lotsa de Casha was dedicated to her then-husband Guy Ritchie since he inspired her.\n\n## Design and illustrations  \n<image>alt=A group of cartoon animals wearing formal clothing and pointing fingers.\nAccording to Communication Arts, the calligraphy of the book was done by Julian Waters with Japanese novelist Toshiya Masuda as the art director and Krupa Jhaveri as the book designer. The images were illustrated by Portuguese painter Rui Paes, who was contacted by Callaway after seeing his painting in The New York Times Magazine of a Singerie in Norway. Having established that he would maintain the secrecy of the project, Callaway sent him the story-draft, based on which Paes developed a small batch of sketches. Among them were cartoon-like paintings based on anthropomorphic animals by French caricaturist J. J. Grandville. The publishers liked them and the idea of the main characters depicted as animals were carried on for the book.  \nPaes sketched various aspect of the characters which helped him in understanding the different nuances the story presented. It took him almost two years to finish the illustrations with the majority of the work being accomplished in the final twelve months. Paes worked 12–14 hours per day uninterruptedly everyday which resulted him getting back pain and Callaway sending him an Aeron chair to aid him. Madonna worked closely with Paes, supplying him the material to be included in the book. She suggested he should travel to Siena and Rome for inspiration, and sent him drawings by her children for inclusion. The artist researched on Renaissance and Baroque painting for further inspiration, including the works of painter Caravaggio. Paes recalled the singer became the inspiration for the image of the wise old man's wife in the story. The animal characters were given as much human qualities and emotions as possible, with hand and body expressions to convey. Paes removed two images from the final illustrations, feeling they were inadequate.\n\n## Publication and reception  \n<image>alt=Bergdorf Goodman building shot from the exterior opposite street.\nThe book was released on June 7, 2005, at a party hosted by retailer Bergdorf Goodman at New York's Fifth Avenue. It was attended by socialites and artists with signed copies of Lotsa de Casha available to purchase for $75, proceedings going to UNICEF. Attendees were dressed up in 18th century garments, depicting characters from the book. According to Reuters, the book reading at Bergdorf Goodman \"drew puzzled responses from the group of about 25 kids, who appeared to have difficulty grasping the book's morals\". Other promotions included book signing at Borders Time Warner Center and reading sessions at New York libraries. The singer read out to the students of Saint Ann's School from Brooklyn Heights, and handed out autographed copies. Tatiana Delgiannakis from New York Post noted that Madonna employed an Italian accent while reading aloud Lotsa's parts. Madonna appeared on NBC's Today show and ABC's The View to talk about the book, and gave interview in Ladies' Home Journal magazine for its July 2005 issue.  \nLotsa de Casha debuted at number three on The New York Times Best Seller list. Elaine Stuart from Parenting found humor in the names Madonna gave in the book, like naming Lotsa's castle as \"Flasha de Casa\" and the mountain on which it is situated as the \"Muchadougha Mountains\", details she believed would make the readers laugh. Roy Blatchford from Books for Keeps liked the story and rated it four-out-of-five stars. He said that the story avoided any cliche plots, \"creates a number of original cameos and bounces along with humour and lively dialogue, clearly influenced by Madonna's Italian New York background.\" Blatchford complimented Paes' images describing them as \"striking\" and the design as \"eye-catching\" thus making Lotsa de Casha \"a first-class picture book to grace any library\". A review in Publishers Weekly called the story as \"artless fable\" but believed that Paes' illustrations improved it with the \"tongue-in-cheek homage to classic Baroque painting\". The reviewer found that in contrast to the grand images, the story appeared simple and the accented edge on Lotsa's words were \"uncharacteristic of a rich gentleman\". Delgiannakis complimented the \"beautifully illustrated\" images in the book but found it to be littered with \"preachy factoids\" like \"Just because something is expensive, doesn’t mean it's worth it\". Boyd Tonkin from The Independent panned the release, calling it \"howlingly egotistical\" and a vehicle of \"personal gratification\" for Madonna, \"rather than a virtue in itself\". Ilene Cooper of Booklist said that like many other celebrities-turned-authors, Madonna mistakenly thought that she could write books for children.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image is associated with the person to whom the book \"Lotsa de Casha\" was dedicated?\nChoice list: \nA.

It has also been called the South Main Innovation District. The district's central hub and first building is the Ion, which opened in 2021 after owner Rice Management Company (RMC) converted it from a former Sears store. The building houses coworking and office spaces, business incubators and accelerators, classrooms, a prototyping lab, investor studio, and restaurants. Current tenants include Chevron Technology Ventures and Microsoft. The district also includes Greentown Labs Houston, a business incubator focused on climate technology and sustainable energy, and a large outdoor plaza.  \nRMC, a division of Rice University, is leading development of the project. Some community members, concerned about the potential gentrification of the nearby Third Ward, a predominantly African-American community, have expressed a range of concerns about the project.  \n## Description  \nThe Ion District is a adj=on innovation district in Midtown, Houston. The district is anchored by the Ion, which serves as a central \"hub for startups, corporations, venture capitalists, business accelerator programs, academics and others\", according to the Houston Chronicle. The district's Greentown Labs Houston is the largest climate technology and sustainable energy incubator in North America, housed in a building that previously housed a now-defunct supermarket. A large plaza designed by James Corner Field Operations is adjacent to the Ion building. The developer also has plans to build a parking garage and a greenway for pedestrians and bicyclists.  \n### Ion building  \n<image>The Ion building (pictured in December 2020) was converted from a former Sears store and serves as the Ion District's central hub.\nThe Ion is a adj=on, six-level building on Main Street in what was formerly a four-story Sears department store built in 1939 and closed in 2018. The $100 million renovation project, which began in 2019 and was completed in 2021, expanded the building to include two additional floors and involved removing aluminum sheeting, restoring Art Deco architectural stylings, adding additional windows, and constructing a lightwell. The building has coworking and office spaces, business incubators and accelerators, classrooms, a prototyping lab, investor studio, and restaurants. The building's Forum Stairs event area includes seating for up to 250 people.  \nTenants include Chevron Technology Ventures, Microsoft, and the coworking company Common Desk. TXRX Labs operates the 6,500 square foot Ion Prototyping Lab (IPL), which provides equipment, engineering and technical support, and training to member entrepreneurs and startups. Equipment includes 3D printers, laser cutters, lathes, CNC mills, and other manufacturing tools. Eateries include Late August (a collaboration involving retired professional athlete and chef Dawn Burrell), The Lymbar (by David and Michael Cordúa), Second Draught, and Common Bond On-the-Go, an outpost of a bakery located in Houston's Montrose neighborhood.  \nIn 2021, the Ion's management team invited local artists to submit proposals for site-specific art installations in windows along two streets. Works by two winning artists or teams will rotate every six months. The commission budget was $20,000 per display. Works by Lina Dib and Preston Gaines were installed in 2022; Dib's Self-Portrait in the Garden has been described as \"a lush, though thoroughly artificial garden of Astro turf, plastic plants and pink flamingos\" with \"a horizontal screen, suspended at a slight angle, which captures and transplants images of people in front of the window into a virtual garden of psychedelic foliage, which incrementally covers up the mirrored subject unless he/she/they move their body\".\n\n### Greentown Labs Houston  \nLocated on San Jacinto Street, Greentown Labs Houston is an incubator and the second U.S. location operated by Somerville, Massachusetts-based Greentown Labs. The approximately adj=on incubator provides funding and office space for approximately 50 startups. The retrofitted building was previously operated and vacated by Fiesta Mart and has community spaces, labs, concrete floors, loading docks, and a trash compactor.  \n## History  \n<image>2017 photograph of the Sears store which was converted into the Ion\n\n<image>2000s photograph of the Fiesta Mart store which was converted into the incubator Greentown Labs Houston\n\n\n### Development  \nRice Management Company (RMC) and its partners announced plans to convert a former Sears store into an innovation center in April 2018. The department store chain had a 99-year lease agreement with Rice University since 1945, and RMC bought the company out of the lease in 2017. RMC led the expansion and renovation of the store, which closed in 2018. SHoP Architects, Gensler, James Carpenter Design Associates, and Walter P Moore designed the new structure.  \nIn July 2019, Houston mayor Sylvester Turner, Rice University president David Leebron, and representatives of the city attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the Ion's redevelopment. Master plans for the district were revealed in November 2019. Jan Odegard, the former executive director of Rice University's Ken Kennedy Institute, became the Ion's executive director in June 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ion hosted online programming, including \"Family Tech Night\" and events for startups.  \nIn mid 2020, Greentown Labs announced plans to open a second incubator in Houston, having considered the city since 2019. In September 2020, the firm confirmed plans to retrofit a former Fiesta Mart store, which the operator had closed two months prior because of declining sales. Additionally, Greentown Labs revealed plans to raise $10 million for the renovation project and three years of working capital. The firm had raised approximately $8 million by September 2020, and building construction began the following month.  \nIn February 2021, Turner hosted a \"reveal\" ceremony for the incubator, which had approximately 20 corporate partners and 16 inaugural startups at the time. Companies that contributed to the project included BHP, CenterPoint Energy, Chevron, Gexa Energy, Shell, Vinson & Elkins, Wells Fargo, and Williams. In April 2021, Greentown Labs received a certificate of occupancy and 30 companies began moving into the space. The incubator opened on Earth Day 2021. The grand opening ceremony was livestreamed and had limited in-person attendance because of the pandemic, which also forced Greentown Labs Houston to scale back programming temporarily.  \n#### Tenants and property management  \nChevron Technology Ventures was named the first tenant and program partner for the Ion in August 2020. Microsoft, which also became a program partner, announced in August 2020 it would invest $1 million into social entrepreneurship programs as part of its participation, and was confirmed as a tenant, along with Common Desk, in late 2020. Houston-based Transwestern became the property manager in November 2020.  \nThe Austin-based innovation and mentorship provider Capital Factory has Houston headquarters in the Ion, as of 2021. In October 2021, the musical theatre production company Theatre Under The Stars (TUTS) announced plans to establish an education and arts center as an anchor tenant in the next phase of the district's development. TXRX Labs has operated the Ion Prototyping Lab since January 2022. In addition to the tenant restaurants in the Ion building, Stuff'd Wings has been a district tenant since April 2022. Established in 2019, the restaurants previously operated as a food truck.  \n#### Partnerships and accelerators  \nThe Ion district announced its first academic partnership in January 2020; Rice University's Susanne M. Glasscock School of Continuing Studies offered courses on computer and data science, financial services, human resources, leadership development, and project management to Ion members. In March 2020, the Ion and the Austin-based nonprofit organization DivInc announced a partnership to develop programs for women and minority entrepreneurs. The Latinx Startup Alliance partnered with the Ion to support Latino entrepreneurs and began hosting virtual programming in October 2020. The Houston-based law firm Baker Botts joined Chevron Technology Ventures and Microsoft as a founding partner in March 2021. According to Community Impact Newspaper, the energy, life sciences, and technology-focused firm \"has supported The Ion since its inception and has provided programming over the last few years\". Aramco Americas also joined as a founding partner. In addition to being a tenant, Capital Factory formed a programming partnership with the Ion in October 2021 to offer events and resources on-site for startups.  \nThe Ion's Accelerator Hub includes the Ion Smart and Resilient Cities Accelerator (ISRCA), the Aerospace Innovation Accelerator for Minority Business Enterprises (AIA for MBEs), the Rice Alliance Clean Energy Accelerator, and DivInc Houston. The Ion team established the ISRCA in September 2019 to focus on disaster recovery. Community Impact Newspaper has said the ISRCA \"addresses the needs of Houston and cities across America by deploying technology into existing civic infrastructure\", and participating startups \"have the chance to build relationships with mentors, corporate networks, municipality decision-makers, and stakeholder partners, and gain exposure in the Greater Houston region\". The AIA for MBEs supports startups in their development of solutions for aerospace-related challenges, and the Rice Alliance Clean Energy Accelerator focuses on sustainable energy projects.  \nIn September 2020, the district received $1.5 million from the Economic Development Administration's Build to Scale program to support the Accelerator Hub's creation. The district received a $1.4 million federal grant from the Minority Business Development Agency in October 2020 to establish an aerospace engineering accelerator in partnership with NASA's Johnson Space Center and DivInc. The ISRCA's third cohort began a 12-week program at the Ion in March 2021. The AIA for MBEs launched in April 2021, with four BIPOC-owned companies selected to participate in the first 12-week program.  \n### Community benefits agreement  \nIn January 2020, Turner announced that the City of Houston would negotiate a community benefits agreement (CBA) with RMC in response to concerns about community impact raised by individuals representing a variety of organizations largely concentrated in the nearby Third Ward, a neighborhood to the east of the Ion. The Ion's groundbreaking ceremony in July 2019 had also attracted students from Rice, Texas Southern University, the University of Houston and local high schools, who had formed the Student Coalition for a Just and Equitable Innovation Corridor to advocate for community benefits.  \nIn January 2020, representatives of 17 student groups wrote a letter to university president Leebron asking RMC to guarantee community benefits to local residents. Students asked Rice to collaborate with the Houston Coalition for Equitable Development Without Displacement (HCEDD), a group of community organizations, residents, and students concerned about the potential gentrification of the Third Ward, a historically and predominantly African-American community. The group tried to develop an exclusive and separate CBA with RMC which would not include the City of Houston as the counterparty.  \nAfter Turner and Rice agreed to negotiate a CBA, RMC and the City of Houston organized a workshop series which included a presentation of the district, a panel discussion of community experts, and breakout sessions for public input. Following the series, RMC convened a working group of civic and community stakeholders to help identify commitments to be documented in the CBA between Rice and the City of Houston. Stakeholders included representatives from Houston's Black and Hispanic chambers of commerce as well as residents of communities surrounding the district. RMC invited HCEDD to participate in the working group. After several months, the working group produced a report that recommended commitments for both Rice and the City of Houston in three focus areas of economic opportunity: housing affordability, inclusive contracting, and hiring. HCEDD, which did not participate in the working group after being offered four positions, criticized the working group's report and process saying the \"recommendations did not go far enough\".  \nHCEDD proposed an alternative set of commitments that included demands for RMC to construct affordable housing for \"existing and long-time\" Third Ward residents, support cultural preservation and sponsor of Juneteenth and Kwanzaa celebrations hosted by local groups. HCEDD also continued to demand an exclusive agreement with RMC which would not include the City of Houston. After the working group released its report, the City of Houston and Rice began negotiations and presented a proposed CBA to the City Council for approval that included $15.3 million dollars in direct community investments to affordable housing, community capacity building, and support for underrepresented entrepreneurs as well as project-based contracting and investment opportunities for minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs) and underrepresented individuals.  \nThe proposed CBA was introduced to City Council for approval on November 3, 2021. The mayor was not present for the City Council meeting and six councilmembers initiated a procedural delay of the vote for a week. The following week, the Houston City Council approved the agreement by a vote of 14 to 3. According to the Houston Chronicle, the agreement includes a \"$5 million investment fund for minorities and women in tech, $4.5 million for affordable housing developers, and $2 million in technology sector job training\", among other community-focused initiatives. District K Councilmember and Vice Mayor Pro-Tem Martha Castex Tatum said the agreement sets a new precedent for community members and developers to work together in Houston and that it was \"more than any developer has ever done in the history of development agreements.\"  \n### Houston Coalition for Equitable Development Without Displacement (HCEDD)  \nThe Houston Coalition for Equitable Development without Displacement, also known as HCEDD, formed in October and held its first community meeting in November 2019 in pursuit of a community benefits agreement with Rice Management Company. The Ion's executive director at the time, Gaby Rowe, was invited to give a presentation on the innovation district and field questions before the public forums held by Rice and the City of Houston in September 2020. In addition to a CBA, student members of the coalition seek a Racial Equity Impact Assessment, as well as public transparency about Rice's community engagement efforts and neighborhood survey. Over the course of several months of public meetings, the coalition came to make up over twenty organizations, formed working groups, and elected a negotiation team. HCEDD has also held public workshops about the research behind the CBA process with Dr. Murtaza Baxamusa, known for his research on community benefits agreements.  \n### City of Houston  \nShortly after a January 20 open letter from a Rice student coalition demanding a CBA with the Houston Coalition for Equitable Development without Displacement and the introduction of a January 27 Student Association resolution, Mayor Turner on January 29 wrote to the president of Rice's Student Association that he has told Andy Icken, the city's chief development officer, to negotiate a \"CBA\" with Rice Management Company and coordinate community input. Such an agreement between a municipality and a developer is traditionally described as a development agreement rather than a community benefits agreement, which by definition must include a community coalition. The City of Houston facilitated online informational webinars alongside RMC in September and October 2020 on job-training, housing affordability, and hiring opportunities.  \n### Rice Student Association Senate Resolution #8  \nThe Rice University Student Association Senate passed a resolution on February 17, 2020, in support of a community benefits agreement process for the Innovation District. The resolution states that a CBA is \"project‐specific contract between developers or cities and community coalitions. CBAs are legally binding, enforceable agreements that call for a range of benefits to be produced by the development project. They allow community groups to have a voice in shaping a project, to press for community benefits that are tailored to their particular needs, and to enforce the developer's promises,\" and asks that RMC make HCEDD an equal party in the CBA negotiation process, as well as create processes for public openness and transparency. Allison Thacker and Ryan LeVasseur, RMC's president and director of real estate respectively, argued against the resolution, stating that HCEDD does not have legal authority to enter into a CBA contract and that the large coalition represents a substantive portion, but not the entire community. Students also shared that RMC \"threatened to disown the Student Association as a legitimate campus body if the SA Senate passed a resolution supporting the HCEDD as a signatory party in the CBA.\"  \n## Funding  \nRice Management Company has announced plans to invest $100 million in renovation for The Ion. The Ion falls within Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) #2, and RMC is seeking $75M in cost reimbursement from City of Houston taxes that are expected as a result of development on properties within the innovation district. The Ion falls within a Texas Census block group that is both a Texas Enterprise Zone and an Opportunity zone, qualifying it for certain financial incentives at the local, state, and federal levels. These can also result in tens of millions of dollars in cost savings for the developer through taxpayer subsidies over the course of a decade.  \n### Texas Enterprise Zone  \nEnterprise Zones are census block groups in Texas with a poverty rate at or above 20%. They are a way to collect various local and state incentives together to spur innovation in order to revitalize an area that is considered distressed. Local benefits may include but aren't limited to tax abatement, permitting fee waivers, publicly-owned buildings transferred below market cost, and low-interest loans. State benefits may include state sales and use tax refunds, depending on the level of investment and the number of jobs created.  \n### Opportunity Zone  \nThis federal program is also for areas that are considered distressed, providing tax benefits such as tax abatement to private investors in hopes of creating economic development and jobs in those areas. These census tracts were nominated by Governor Greg Abbott, seeking to address issues including risk of economic disrupters such as hurricanes, relatively low population density, and persistent unemployment. A 2020 report found that many opportunity zone beneficiaries are real estate investors who were likely to still do the development even without taxpayer subsidies, rather than companies that are creating jobs.  \n### Midtown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) #2  \nOn August 26, 2021, the board of the Midtown TIRZ voted to approve an economic development agreement between the TIRZ and Rice Management Company. In exchange for leading construction and repair projects within the Innovation District, the TIRZ will provide $65 million in cost reimbursements for RMC's investment. Despite months of critical feedback requesting that the TIRZ require RMC to enter into a Community Benefits Agreement with a community coalition before approving the deal, six of the seven board members voted for the agreement. Board member Caton Fenz, CEO of ConnectGen, noted that the development may incidentally result in some affordable housing, however the agreement does not include any mention of affordable housing or any measures to address gentrification, particularly in the Third Ward community neighboring Midtown. The Midtown TIRZ has bought an estimated $72 million worth of land in Third Ward covering 4 million square feet.  \n### Academics  \nRice University's Glasscock School of Continuing Studies was the first school to announce coursework at the Ion, including data science and financial services.  \n### Tenants  \n* Aerospace Innovation Hub (NASA partnership)  \n* Baker Botts  \n* Chevron Technology Ventures  \n* Greentown Labs  \n* Microsoft  \n* Schlumberger  \n* Common Desk  \n### Recreation  \n#### Restaurants  \nThe district has the following restaurants either open or in development:  \n* Common Bond  \n* Late August  \n* Shipley Do-Nuts  \n* Stuff’d Wings\n\nQuestion: Which former department store was renovated and transformed into the Ion, a central hub for coworking and office spaces, business incubators, and other facilities?\nChoice list: \nA.

It was held on June 17, 2012, in Brooklyn, Michigan, at Michigan International Speedway, before a crowd of 82,000 people. The track is a superspeedway that holds NASCAR races. Hendrick Motorsports driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. won the 200-lap race starting from 17th place. Tony Stewart of the Stewart-Haas Racing team finished in second, and Roush Fenway Racing's Matt Kenseth was third.  \nMarcos Ambrose won his first career pole position by posting a new track record speed in qualifying. He led the first five laps until Greg Biffle passed him on the sixth lap. He led the next twenty laps before Ambrose retook it for another five laps afterward. Biffle retook the lead on lap 54, holding it until Ambrose re-passed him to return to the front of the field fifteen laps later. Earnhardt took the lead for the first time on the 70th lap, and he kept the position for a total of 95 laps, more than any other driver. At the race's final restart on 141, Earnhardt led through the final round of green flag pit stops to win the race. There were a total of eight cautions and 23 lead changes among 14 drivers during the event.  \nThe victory was Earnhardt's first in 143 races, his second at Michigan International Speedway, and the 19th of his career. The result moved him to within four points of Drivers' Championship leader Kenseth. Biffle maintained third place, and Jimmie Johnson moved past Denny Hamlin in fourth place. Chevrolet maintained its lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 105 points, 18 points ahead of Toyota, 28 points in front of Ford, and 44 points ahead of Dodge with 21 races left in the season. The race attracted 5,284,000 television viewers.  \n## Background  \n<image>Michigan International Speedway, where the race was held.\nThe 2012 Quicken Loans 400 was the 15th of 36 scheduled stock car races of the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. It ran for 200 laps over a distance of abbr=on, and was held on June 17, 2012, in Brooklyn, Michigan, at Michigan International Speedway, a superspeedway that holds NASCAR races. The standard track at Michigan International Speedway is a four-turn abbr=on superspeedway. The track's turns are banked at eighteen degrees, while the front stretch (the location of the finish line) is banked at twelve degrees. The back stretch, has a five degree banking.  \nIn preparation for the race, NASCAR held two test sessions on June 12, 2012 for teams to test the newer pavement at Michigan, the first since 1995. During the first test session (which was held in the morning and lasted for four hours) Mark Martin was quickest ahead of Kevin Harvick with a speed of km/h and a time of 35.805 seconds, while Tony Stewart was fastest in the second and final test session with a time of 35.662 seconds and recorded a speed of km/h. Top speeds approached km/h during the day; NASCAR determined that the installation of restrictor plates would not be required, and NASCAR vice-president of competition Robin Pemberton spoke of his expectation that speeds would reduce as the surface rubbered in and track temperatures increased.  \nBefore the race, Matt Kenseth led the Drivers' Championship with 523 points, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. stood in second with 513 points. Greg Biffle was in third place on 507 points, three points ahead of Denny Hamlin in fourth and fourteen points in front of Jimmie Johnson in fifth. Harvick, with 470 points, was five points in front of Martin Truex Jr., as Stewart with 448 points, was five points in front of Clint Bowyer in ninth and eight points in front of the tenth-placed Brad Keselowski. Carl Edwards and Kyle Busch rounded out the top twelve drivers. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was leading with 96 points, thirteen points ahead of Toyota in the second position. Ford, with 71 points, was also thirteen points ahead of Dodge in the battle for third place. Hamlin was the race's defending champion.  \nThere were two driver changes heading into the race. After he was suspended from the preceding Pocono 400 for verbally abusing Sporting News reporter Bob Pockrass at the Nationwide Series round at Dover International Speedway, Kurt Busch was reinstated to the Car number 51 Phoenix Racing car after David Reutimann drove in his place. Team owner James Finch spoke to Busch during the week, and confirmed that the driver would remain with the team until the end of the year. Tommy Baldwin Racing announced that driver Tony Raines would compete in its No. 10 car in place of Reutimann as part of the team's plan for the upcoming races.\n\n## Practice and qualifying  \nThree practice sessions were held before the Sunday race. The first and second sessions that took place on Friday ran for 80 minutes, and the third additional practice session held on Saturday lasted 75 minutes. In the first practice session, Martin was fastest with a lap of 35.754 seconds, almost six hundredths of a second faster than Earnhardt in second. Trevor Bayne, Stewart, Kenseth, Juan Pablo Montoya, Jeff Gordon, Kasey Kahne, Paul Menard, and Truex followed in positions three to ten. Biffle paced the second practice session with a 35.172 seconds lap. He was six hundredths of a second faster than Marcos Ambrose in the second position. Harvick, Edwards, Menard, Bayne, Johnson, Joey Logano, Kurt Busch, and Kenseth completed the top ten ahead of the qualifying session. The only incident in the Friday practice sessions was Jamie McMurray scraping the right-hand quarter of his vehicle when he made contact with the outside barrier.  \n<image>group=\"n\"  An extra 75 minute practice session was scheduled following the track's Nationwide Series race. Biffle was quickest with a lap of 36.801 seconds, followed by Johnson, Edwards, Kahne, McMurray, Kurt Busch, A. J. Allmendinger, Truex, Martin, and Harvick. Top speeds approached no higher than abbr=on, but the new left-hand side tires received a mixed reception from drivers. Newman felt that NASCAR made the correct decision, and Edwards predicted that the while the cars were looser, it would improve the quality of racing. Earnhardt, however, commented that he could not complete extra laps due to a handling difficulty, and Ambrose noted a lower amount of grip and increased vehicular imbalance provided by the tires.\n\n\n### Qualifying results  \n## Race  \nLive television coverage of the race began at 12:01 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−05:00) in the United States on TNT. Commentary was provided by Adam Alexander, Wally Dallenbach Jr. and Kyle Petty. Around the start of the race, weather conditions were partly cloudy with the air temperature at abbr=on; the air temperature was expected to reach a high of abbr=on, and scattered showers were forecast to fall on the track. The start was delayed at 1:18 local time because jet driers were instructed to remove standing water. It began to drizzle 73 minutes later, and jet driers again circulated the track. Doug Bradshaw, pastor of Williamston Free Methodist Church, began pre-race ceremonies with an invocation. Members of the United States Army Band performed the national anthem, and Detroit Red Wings ice hockey starting goaltender Jimmy Howard and his son James commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, Johnson and Newman moved to the rear of the field because they had changed their engines.  \n<image>Matt Kenseth (pictured in 2009) led after passing Ambrose early in the race and eventually finished third after leading 17 laps.\nThe race commenced at 3:05 p.m. local time. Ambrose broke free from the pack to lead on the approach to the first turn. The first caution came on the following lap when Kurt Busch spun on the backstretch. Ambrose maintained the lead at the lap five restart and held off a challenge from Biffle. On lap six, Biffle tried again, and was successful next time round, getting ahead of Ambrose to take over the lead. Josh Wise's engine failed on lap ten, necessitating the second caution as oil was laid on the track. During the caution, Earnhardt and Biffle made pit stops. The race restarted six laps later, with Biffle keeping his lead over Ambrose. After starting ninth, Logano had moved into the third position by the 21st lap. On the next lap, Kenseth passed Logano to move into third place. A competition caution was waved on lap 26 to mandate that teams made pit stops because of the new left-hand side tires, and the track's newer pavement. Ambrose led the field at the restart on the 31st lap. Kenseth overtook Ambrose to claim the lead on the next lap.  \nAfter starting 34th, Kyle Busch was running in seventh by lap 34. As Kenseth increased his lead over Ambrose, Martin overtook Logano for third place on the 39th lap. Four laps later, Logano lost the fourth position to Biffle. That same lap, Keselowski got ahead of Almirola for tenth. Upfront, Ambrose closed the gap to Kenseth, and he overtook him for the lead on lap 49 despite the presence of Ken Schrader's slower car. A second competition caution for drivers to make mandatory pit stops came out on lap 51. The caution was withdrawn five laps later, and Biffle led the field at the restart, followed by Ambrose and Martin. On lap 60, Ambrose attempted to challenge Biffle for the first position but he could not pass him. Keselowski moved into fifth four laps later. On the 69th lap, Ambrose passed Biffle for the lead, and Earnhardt got ahead of Biffle soon after. On the next lap, Earnhardt overtook Ambrose to become the new leader. While Earnhardt increased his advantage at the front of the pack, Martin got by Biffle to advance into third by the 79th lap.  \nIn the meantime, drivers elected to make green flag pit stops between the 78th to 81st laps. On lap 82, the fifth caution was prompted when foam from a SAFER barrier beside the circuit had to be cleared by series officials. Drivers continued to make pit stops under caution conditions. At the lap 87 restart, Earnhardt was passed by Stewart on the entry to the first turn for the first position. Newman and Logano got ahead of Ambrose to move into sixth and seventh places on lap 90. Ambrose lost a further four positions to Martin, Keselowski, Menard, and Montoya during lap 91. By the following lap, Gordon was in fourth place. Later, Stewart increased his lead over Earnhardt to seven-tenths of a second by lap 97. However, eight laps later, Earnhardt closed the gap to Stewart and passed him to get back the lead. Green flag pit stops were made from laps 115 and 120, before a sixth caution came out for Kurt Busch who spun for a second time in the second turn on the 121st lap. Gordon led at the lap 126 restart, but his teammate Earnhardt passed him around the outside in turn two soon after.\n<image>Dale Earnhardt Jr. (pictured in 2015) led a race-high 95 to end a 143-race winless streak and claim the 19th victory of his career.\nOn the lap, a seventh caution was prompted for a three-car accident, that began when Logano attempted to avoid hitting Gilliland (who made contact with the barrier), and lost control of his car. Logano turned back into the wall, collecting Gilliland and Kahne. Logano was transported out of the track via an ambulance as a precaution. The race restarted on the 133rd lap, with Earnhardt holding the lead over Gordon and Montoya through the first and second turns. Soon after, the eighth caution was waved; Hamlin and Newman made contact, sending Hamlin spinning on the exit to turn four, and into the grass. As Hamlin went down pit road with oil trailing from his car, its right-hand side caught fire, and he stopped in his pit box. Hamlin received assistance to exit his car by Newman's and Kyle Busch's pit crews, as safety officials extinguished the fire. Hamlin was unhurt. Earnhardt continued to maintain the lead through turn one at the lap 141 restart. Behind Earnhardt, Stewart kept second place from Gordon. Five laps later, Biffle passed Bowyer for fourth, and Ambrose was overtaken by Martin for tenth.  \nJohnson got past Montoya on the 147th lap. Twelve laps later, Bowyer was passed by Kenseth. Biffle overtook Gordon to move into third on lap 160. The final round of green flag pit stops began on lap 163, as Earnhardt made his stop. Biffle, Bowyer, McMurray, and Keselowski each led the pack over the next seven laps, until Earnhardt regained the lead after all pit stops had been completed. On lap 186, Biffle lost third place to Johnson. Six laps later, Johnson lost third to Kenseth, and fell to fifth as Biffle got ahead of him. In the meantime, Earnhardt opened his lead at the front of the field to more than five seconds, and he held it for the remainder of the race to win. It was his first victory in 143 races, his second at Michigan International Speedway, and the 19th of his career. Stewart finished second, Kenseth was third, Biffle took fourth, and Johnson fifth. Gordon, Bowyer, Montoya, Ambrose, and Harvick rounded out the top ten finishers. There were 23 lead changes among 14 different drivers during the race. Earnhardt's 95 laps led was the most of any competitor.\n\n### Post-race  \nEarnhardt appeared in Victory Lane to celebrate his first win since the 2008 LifeLock 400 in front of the crowd of 82,000 people; the win earned him $168,775. He dedicated the victory to his fanbase and thanked his team and pit crew for supporting him, \"I was so nervous in the last few laps of that race four years ago. Today, this is the worst feeling, riding around there with 15 laps to go wondering what's going to happen or how you were going to lose. I was just thinking, man, those laps could not go by fast enough. It feels good to win, But in a day or two, I'll be thirsty for the next one.\" Stewart conceded that Earnhardt had a faster car than his but insisted that the latter's victory was not designated as \"a national holiday\" due to its popularity, \"This morning they were celebrating his fourth anniversary of his last win, so I guess we're all in a state of mourning now, because he's broke that string now, so I don't know what we're all supposed to think.\" Third-placed Kenseth said of his race, \"It was kind of a long day. We were pretty good in the beginning of the race and got shuffled back and it was tough to work traffic today. They got the setup good on the last two runs and had good pit stops and we were able to stand on the gas and work our way up there to third.\"  \nEarnhardt received congratulations via text messages from various people and celebrities through Twitter, including former driver Mario Andretti, multi-instrumentalist Charlie Daniels and country music singer Brad Paisley. He also received a phone call from South Carolina Gamecocks football coach Steve Spurrier. Steve Letarte, Earnhardt's crew chief, commented his belief that the driver and team's focus helped him to win, \"I can't say enough about the group of guys we have here. They are a tremendous group. They deserve a tremendous amount of the credit. Dale deserves a tremendous amount of credit as well. He's not only a great driver, but he's a leader in the team. He does it in his own style and we love the style he brings. It was a fun day to finally get him to Victory Lane.\" Tori Petry of sports radio station WGGG opined the victory helped NASCAR receive better exposure, and Los Angeles Times writer Jim Peltz wrote he believed it would provide the series with an attendance and television ratings increase. Jeff Hammond of Speed said the victory was the result of Earnhardt's team having improved momentum and better focus. He wrote of his expectation for Earnhardt to perform well for the remainder of the season.  \nHamlin's car bay fire on lap 133 was the first of his career. He said it was an experience that he hoped to avoid in the future but praised the modern safety standards of racing vehicles, \"Thankfully, we've got everything that we have safety-wise. One good thing at least is that Ryan's guys came and got me out – and a couple of the 18 (Busch's) guys. NASCAR is a family, and any time anyone is in trouble, everyone is going to try to help. It's good that those guys were around and willing to take a chance.\" Logano commented that he believed he could have corrected his car in his three-car crash with Gilliland and Kahne, \"It's a little frustrating, but we had a top-10 car today, I think we had a top 10 coming to us here – maybe a top five.\" Ambrose, who led early in the event and then lost positions, said he would accept a top ten finish and was proud of his team, \"We led some laps and looked good up there. It was a strong day for us. Not quite what we wanted, but we will take it and move along to Sonoma.\"  \nThe result kept Kenseth in the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 523 points, ahead of Earnhardt who lowered his advantage from ten to four points. Biffle maintained third place with 548 points. With 532 points, Johnson moved ahead of Hamlin (514 points) to assume the fourth position. Harvick, Truex, Stewart, Bowyer, Keselowski, Edwards and Kyle Busch rounded out the top twelve. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 105 points. Toyota remained in second place with 87 points, ten points ahead of Ford, who in turn, were sixteen points in front of Dodge in fourth. The race had a television audience of 5,284,000 million viewers and a 3.2 US rating, a 10 percent ratings increase and 8 percent more viewership than the 2011 race; it took two hours, 52 minutes, and 29 seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 5.393 seconds.  \n### Race results  \n## Standings after the race  \nDrivers' Championship standings  \nManufacturers' Championship standings  \n* Note: Only the top twelve positions are included for the driver standings.\n\nQuestion: Which driver led the most laps during the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway and ultimately won the race?\nChoice list: \nA.

Transit has variously used passenger trains, horsecars, streetcars, interurbans, trolley coaches, and buses. Current service is through the Central Ohio Transit Authority's bus system, numerous intercity bus companies, and through bikeshare, rideshare, and electric scooter services.  \nPublic transit began in Columbus with Union Station, built in 1851. The station was jointly operated by the Columbus and Xenia Railroad and the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad, making it the first union station in the world. Local mass transit efforts began three years later, in 1854, with the founding of the Columbus Street Railroad Company. It only began operating in 1863, utilizing a fleet of horsecars (horse-drawn streetcars). Electric streetcars began operation in the city in 1888. Meanwhile, subsequent rail stations were built in the city, including the third Union Station, completed in 1897. Streetcars and their longer-distance interurban counterparts became prolific around this time. In the 1930s, as automobiles grew in popularity and track maintenance suffered, the streetcars were all converted to trolleybuses, taking place from 1933 to 1948. Trolleybuses only operated until 1965, themselves replaced by diesel buses. With private bus operators losing profits, bus service in Columbus was transferred over to the public Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) in 1974. Intercity rail permanently stopped serving Columbus in 1977. COTA operated traditional local bus service until the 2010s, when it began modernizing its fleet with compressed natural gas-fueled buses, redeveloped its route network, and added a downtown circulator, bus rapid transit line, wifi connectivity, contactless payments, and other modern amenities. Though resuming local or intercity rail has been proposed since the 1970s, Columbus is currently the largest city in the United States without any form of passenger rail service. Amtrak service to Columbus is proposed under the American Jobs Plan.  \n## Historical services  \n### Intercity rail  \n<image>The Toledo and Ohio Central Railroad Station (1895) is the last remaining station building in Columbus\nPublic transit began in Columbus with the creation of its first train station, the first Union Station. The station was located in Downtown Columbus, Ohio, near The Short North neighborhood. Union Station and its predecessors served railroad passengers in Columbus from 1851 until April 28, 1977. The first station building was the first union station in the world, built in 1851. It was twelve years before any local mass transit was developed in the city. Its replacement was built from 1873 to 1875, just before demolition of the first station building. After traffic problems on High Street, as well as increased rail traffic became problematic, a new station was planned by Daniel Burnham beginning in 1893. The new station opened in 1897, and its arcade along High Street was finished in 1899. By 1928, part of the arcade was demolished. Passenger service significantly declined from the 1950s to the 1970s. The arcade was demolished in 1976 to make way for a new convention center, although it had been placed on the National Register of Historic Places two years prior. Train service stopped at Union Station in 1977, and the remaining portions of the station were demolished in 1979. The demolished arcade was delisted in 1999. A portion of the arcade was saved and is the focal point of the McFerson Commons park in the nearby Arena District.  \nThe Toledo and Ohio Central Railroad Station also served the city's Franklinton neighborhood, located near downtown. The station was built in 1895 and designed by Columbus architects Yost & Packard. It served the city from 1896, diverting services from the second Union Station, until 1930, when its services moved to the third Union Station. The Toledo and Ohio station is the only remaining rail station building in the city.\n\n### Mass transit  \nThe Columbus Interurban Terminal  \n<image>One of two remaining Columbus streetcars, operated 1926–1948, and now at the Ohio Railway Museum\nThe first public transit in the city was the horse-drawn omnibus, utilized in 1852 to transport passengers to and from the city's first train station, and in 1853, between Columbus, Franklinton, Worthington, and Canal Winchester.  \nFirst formed in 1854, the Columbus Street Railroad Company (CSRC) was authorized by the city to build a number of lines, but nothing came about initially. Its horse-powered streetcar line first ran along High Street on June 10, 1863, in the midst of the Civil War. The initial line ran for km from Union Station to Mound Street. When traffic dropped off after the war, the Columbus Street Railroad Company faced financial difficulties, but started making a profit by 1868. Following the stabilization of the High Street line, the Friend Street Railroad Company was created in the same year, first reaching East Public Lane (now Parsons Avenue) and eventually reaching the Fairgrounds (now Franklin Park).  \nSubsequently, the North Columbus Railroad Company, East Park Place Street Railroad Company, State and Oak Street Railroad Company, and the Glenwood & Green Lawn Railroad Company were formed. The horse-powered cars were slow, but made it possible to travel to locations within the city that were beyond a comfortable walking distance. Mergers were frequent, and the Columbus Railroad Company (formerly CSRC) merged with the Friend Street Railroad Company and the East Park Place Railroad Company. The new venture was known as the Columbus Consolidated Street Railroad Company. The State and Oak Street lines were bought by the new company in the following years. Other transit companies came and went in the late 1800s, many of which never became operative.  \nIt was also during this era that long distance rail travel became quite popular. The High Street line faced delays of up to seven hours per day due to the level crossing of 10 heavy rail tracks across High Street at Union Station. To remedy the problem, subway tunnels were built under the tracks. They were dark, and the smell from the horse droppings made the trip unpleasant. From the period of 1863–1892, more than a dozen horsecar companies set up shop in the city, and total trackage was expanded to km prior to electrification.  \nIn 1888, the first electric powered streetcar ran on Chittenden Avenue from High Street to the State Fairgrounds. However, it was not successful initially. The first line with successful electrification was the Glenwood & Green Lawn Street Railroad (with trackage mainly along West Broad Street), which was completed in August 1890. The High Street, Long Street, and Mount Vernon Avenue lines were electrified in the following year. The advantages in speed and cleanliness quickly made equestrian power obsolete, and the last horse drawn car ran in 1892, when service fully transitioned to electric streetcars. Also in that year, yet another naming change came with the sale of the Columbus Consolidated Street Railroad Company to the newly formed \"Columbus Street Railway Company\" for $3,000,000. At this time, the Glenwood & Green Lawn line was acquired. In 1895, the Columbus Railway, Power and Light Company purchased an amusement park that would be known as Olentangy Park. It was located on the southern end of Clintonville. The idea behind the purchase was to increase ridership on the line during non-peak hours by providing an attractive destination at the terminus. Likewise, other transit companies built Indianola Park on North Fourth Street and Minerva Park in the village of the same name.  \nNotable streetcar strikes took place in 1890 and 1892. In the 1890 strike, employees sought higher pay and shorter hours. Their one-week strike was supported by the public, and led to increased wages and hour reductions from 16-hour days to 12-hour days.\n<image>The former Columbus Railway, Power & Light office in present-day Milo-Grogan, 2021\nIn 1893, the Columbus Railway Power & Light Company was formed, controlled by E. W. Clark & Co., the same entity that controlled the Columbus Street Railway Company. The Columbus Railway Power & Light Company eventually controlled all streetcar and electric lighting business in the city.  \nElectric power ushered in the golden age of street traction in Columbus. In 1899, the High Street subway tunnels were replaced with a bridge which ran above the heavy rail tracks. The system was so popular that Columbus Railway Power & Light experimented with a double deck streetcar in 1914. However, the delays in loading and unloading gave the bi-level design no advantage over its standard counterpart, and the cars were quickly retired. Total trackage reached 0 by 1916, and the system carried 66,000,000 paying passengers with an additional 16,000,000 people riding on transfer tickets that year. By 1927, streetcars ran to Bexley, Gahanna, Green Lawn Cemetery, Minerva Park, Marble Cliff, Upper Arlington, Westerville, and Worthington.  \nMost streetcar lines in Columbus used a broad gauge track which measured 5ft2in. Building non-standard gauge was sometimes used as a way to keep long distance passenger and freight railroads from accidentally or intentionally running their cars on city streets. However, some lines built in the late 1800s used the 4ft8.5in standard gauge width, such as the Worthington Line which ran long Summit Street, Hudson Avenue, Arcadia Avenue, and High Street. With the advent of the interurban, many sections of dual gauge track were built to allow the streetcars and interurbans to use the same route despite their different widths.\n\n### 1910 streetcar strike  \nCrowd during the 1910 strike  \nIn the summer of 1910, the city experienced a large uprising. The 1910 Streetcar Strike began as peaceful protests, but led to thousands rioting throughout the city, injuring hundreds of people. Conditions for the streetcar workers were difficult. The operators worked for only 19–20 cents per hour, worked 60–65 hours per week, and worked for years without a day off. These conditions led to a high turnover rate. The Columbus Railway and Light Co. paid its riders to report on irregular employee activities, and the company wouldn't require hearings before firing employees for dishonesty. In early 1910, 35 employees of the company met with manager E.K. Stewart, requesting increased wages. The company fired the entire group as a result. In March, about half of the Columbus Railway and Light Company's employees formed a local chapter of the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees labor union. The union sought the reinstatement of the 35 workers, along with pay raises, better working conditions, and job stability. The streetcar company chose a hardline position, with no compromise offered.  \nThe public primarily sided with the union. The Columbus Chamber of Commerce, anticipating conflict, hosted a mandatory meeting between the union and company in June 1910. On July 23, its hearings concluded, finding that both parties were partly at fault, and that a peaceful resolution should be found. The meeting mostly added to tensions, however, and the strike began the next day at 4 am. The union's chapter had grown to 600 members by this point. They planned to not show up for work, instead selling union buttons around the city and picketing the company's streetcar barns. The streetcar company chose to hire strikebreakers at $30 per week, over double the standard wage of $12.50. They also hired a special policing force, supplied by the local John J. Mahoney Detective Agency, to protect the streetcars and facilities. The strike ended up more serious, as crowds barricaded streetcar tracks and threw bricks and rocks into the streetcars. The company police responded with gunfire. That night, 76 people were arrested, though riots continued on the following day. Mayor George Sidney Marshall called in about 5,000 members of the Ohio National Guard. The troops kept order in the city until their departure on August 7. More rioting then took place, with shootings, barricades, stonings, and streetcars blown up with dynamite. It led to the National Guard returning, and the union and public moreso aiming for a peaceful end to the riots. Still about 3,000 to 4,000 strikers, sympathizers, or disrupters continued to riot. It led to a bad public image of the city, hurting business activity, and worrying the city planning for a state fair in September. On October 18, the union admitted defeat, and its 570 striking workers either returned to work or moved to work elsewhere in Columbus, or for Cleveland streetcar companies.  \n### Further history  \nThe interurban system in 1917  \nOnly three years after the streetcar strike, the Great Flood of 1913 affected the transit system, causing millions in damage, destroying streetcar tracks and bridges, and stopping service west of the Scioto River for a month. Buses first began service in the city in 1926, with the Fifth Avenue bus line established that Christmas Eve. The first buses to operate were Mack gas-electric vehicles, which operated on crosstown feeder lines for people who lived far from streetcar routes. Buses began operation on former streetcar lines within the next several years.  \nInterurbans declined quickly after World War I, with competition from buses and private vehicles. The last line to operate out of Columbus was the Cincinnati & Lake Erie, in 1938.  \n<image>A trolley bus in front of Columbus City Hall, c. 1936-55\nSimilarly, in 1933, a decision was made to gradually convert the entire streetcar system to trolley buses (trackless trams). Slowed by the effects of the Great Depression and World War II, the process took 15 years to compete. The Columbus Railway, Power & Light Company was renamed to the Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company in 1937. On September 5, 1948, the last two fixed rail trams ran along Neil Avenue and Main Street. The electric company handed over its transit operations to the Columbus Transit Company in November 1949. A lack of investment in maintenance of the tracks, as well as the age of the automobile had slowly brought the demise of the system. The buses were larger, more comfortable and powerful, and soon had air conditioning. The trolley buses did not last long either, being gradually replaced by diesel buses as well. The last trolley bus ran on May 30, 1965. That last ride traversed the Main, Oak, and High Street lines, a 5.5-hour ride that culminated in a ceremony for pulling down a trolley pole and de-energizing the streetcar lines.  \nBus investment continued throughout the 1960s and 1970s, though ridership had been irreversibly declining since 1948, with a monumentous drop from then through 1972  from 80.1 million passengers to 15.2 million. In 1973, the Columbus Transit Company went out of business. The company was subsequently replaced by the government agency the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), which still operates today.  \nDespite some changes over the years, many current COTA buses run the same routes as the former streetcars. Bus lines 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 13 deviate very little from the routes taken by their railed predecessors.  \nAround 2017, the company Hopper Carts began serving downtown and the Short North with a free ridesharing service paid for by businesses and with ads on the sides of the vehicles. The company utilized several six-passenger Polaris GEM e6 vehicles, described as \"retro-futuristic golf carts\". Another program, car2go, operated in Columbus, mostly at Ohio State University and downtown, until 2018. The business operated Smart Cars available to rent by the minute.  \nSmart Columbus, a transportation initiative of the City of Columbus and the Columbus Partnership, operated two driverless shuttle pilots, in downtown Columbus and Linden, around 2018.\n\n## Current services  \n### COTA  \nColumbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA). The service operates 41 routes with a fleet of 440 buses, serving approximately 19 million passengers per year. COTA operates 23 regular fixed-service routes, 14 express services, a bus rapid transit route, a free downtown circulator, night service, an airport connector, and other services.  \nCOTA's administrative offices are located in the William J. Lhota Building in Downtown Columbus. It is managed by President and CEO Joanna Pinkerton along with a 13-member board of trustees. COTA is funded by a permanent 0.25% sales tax as well as another 10-year 0.25% sales tax. The agency was founded in 1971, replacing the private Columbus Transit Company. The Central Ohio Transit Authority began operating in 1974, and has made gradual improvements to its fleet and network. Its first bus network redesign took place in 2017. The 2010s have also seen noted service improvements, with the addition of the CBUS free downtown circulator in 2014, its AirConnect airport service in 2016, and the CMAX bus rapid transit service in 2018.  \n### Intercity buses  \nIntercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines, Barons Bus Lines, Miller Transportation, GoBus, and other carriers.  \nIntercity bus transit dates back to 1929 in Columbus. Numerous stations have been constructed in Downtown Columbus; the Columbus Bus Station was completed in 1969.  \n### Alternative transportation  \nIn partnership with UZURV, COTA provides on demand transportation for the elderly and disabled.  \nAlong with most other US cities, Columbus has several private transportation options, including ridesharing, bikeshare, and electric scooters. The city's bikeshare system is CoGo, operated by Lyft. Electric scooter companies operating in the city include Bird, Spin, and Lime.  \nOhio State University students, faculty, and employees are served by the Campus Area Bus Service, an Ohio State-run bus service around the Columbus campus.  \n## Proposals  \n### Former proposals  \n#### TransCenter  \nTransCenter was a proposed replacement for Union Station. The demolition and replacement of Union Station dates to a 1969–1975 lawsuit against the Columbus-based Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI). The institute was formed as a nonprofit and still operates as one, though its improper profit uses led to the lawsuit. As a result, BMI offered about $80 million for various causes, including $36.5 million to establish a convention center at the site of Union Station. BMI established  the Battelle Commons Corporation in 1974 to handle the project.  \nBattelle Commons Corporation applied for grants to create a transit center as part of the convention center, including from the Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA) and Federal Highway Administration. The transit center project was supported by the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), Columbus's mass transit agency. The proposed hub, titled TransCenter, was to include 2,000 square feet inside the restored Union Station arcade, containing transit information, ticket offices, a bus waiting and loading area, and entranceways to transit below street-level. A new 20,000-square-foot bus facility and COTA office was to be constructed alongside the arcade. The proposed funding included $6.24 million from the UMTA for buildings and platforms, $1.05 million from the Federal Railroad Administration for restoring the arcade, and Battelle contributing $1.56 million for the building and platforms, and $450,000 for the arcade. The combined project was to cost $9.3 million. It was noted that Battelle made no effort to find funding from obvious sources including the State Historic Preservation Office, the National Endowment for the Arts, Department of the Interior, Community Development Block Grants, or General Revenue Sharing Funds.  \nOn October 19, 1976, Battelle's trustees decided to demolish the station, stating it would be an \"imprudent use of Battelle's money\", even though it was noted to be a small portion. The organization gave no warning to outside organizations. The State Historic Preservation was not advised, nor was COTA; COTA's executive director stated the public mistakenly blamed it for the demolition. The City of Columbus also stated it was not involved in the decision, but knew Battelle was considering it. Battelle believed the demolition would not block the pending federal funding.  \nAt 6 pm on Friday, October 22, 1976, S.G. Loewendick & Sons demolished nearly the entire arcade. By 6 pm on the next day, a temporary restraining order secured by the Ohio Historical Society halted the demolition. The order noted that improper procedures were followed in planning its demolition. Battelle then allowed the historical society 120 days to remove the remaining remnant of the demolition, a single arch left standing; Battelle offered no funds to help preserve or move the arch. COTA's director still expressed his desire for TransCenter to be built, despite the arcade's loss. Battelle published development plans with the arcade removed as soon as October 24. The arcade's demolition prompted the UMTA to withdraw all $6.24 million in funding, stating the act violated the spirit of the law and was inconsistent with UMTA requirements.  \n#### Ameriflora '92 Monorail  \nAs part of the planning for the 1992 Ameriflora exhibition, Columbus city leaders considered a $50 million proposal to build monorails connecting the Port Columbus International Airport to the Greater Columbus Convention Center. The July 13, 1987, \"very loose\" proposal from Von Roll Habegger would have connected the Ohio Center with a loop along 3rd and High streets to the county offices at Mound Street, with a potential extension south to German Village and the Brewery District. A second proposed loop would cross the Scioto River to connect to the Ohio Penitentiary, Veterans Memorial, and Central High School. The estimated cost was $40–50 million, if a contract could be signed by 1988. The monorail would use rubber-tired beamrider cars carrying 4,000 to 8,000 passengers per hour at speeds up to 30 mph.  \nA committee formed to study the proposal, led by Upper Arlington Mayor Priscilla Mead, rejected it in November 1987. The committee recommended an automated peoplemover solution like those used in Detroit and Miami, with a daily ridership of 6,000 to 8,000 people, at a cost of $60–80 million.  \n#### Ohio Hub  \nThe Ohio Hub project, created in 2009, proposed a high-speed rail service connecting Columbus with Cincinnati and to a proposed hub in Cleveland and onward to the east. As of 2018, the project remained unfunded.  \n#### Columbus Streetcar  \nThe Columbus Streetcar was a proposed streetcar system to be located in and close to Downtown Columbus. Initially planned to run along High Street, the line would have run for km and connected the Ohio State campus with the Franklin County Government Center. As of February 2009, the plan was indefinitely on hold.  \n#### Rail proposals  \nVarious proposals have been discussed for light rail in Columbus. The first formal discussions took place in the 1980s. In 1999, voters rejected a levy request which would have funded it. In 2002, COTA began studying a 13-mile line from downtown to the north side. With an inability to win federal funding, the effort ceased in 2006.  \nCOTA's long-range transit plan released in 1999 proposed eight commuter rail routes along existing freight rail tracks. The plan called for these services to be phased in from 2005 to 2020. COTA would begin operating a rail line north along I-71 in 2005, a northwest track along Ohio Route 315 in 2008, a track along Cleveland Avenue in 2011, along East Broad Street in 2014, another northwest track and southeast track in 2017, and a south track along Route 3 and West Broad track in 2020. Alongside the commuter rail improvements, the plan called for bus service to double, including 24-hour service, as well as a downtown rail service and multi-modal transit hub as well as multiple circulator bus loops. COTA placed two sales tax proposals on the November 1999 ballot to fund current service and these improvements, Issue 21 continuing a.25 percent sales tax for 10 more years, as well as Issue 20, a new permanent.25 percent sales tax. Issue 21 failed to pass, restricting COTA's ability to build rail lines.  \n### Current proposals  \nNumerous proposals are being developed to link Columbus with other Midwest cities, and to link neighborhoods within Columbus. Transit modes being developed include intercity rail, the hyperloop, and light rail or bus rapid transit. LinkUS is an initiative announced in 2020 to create high-capacity rapid transit in Central Ohio. The initiative is a collaboration between COTA, the City of Columbus, and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission. The initiative will also aim to create jobs as well as transit-oriented developments. It will begin its focus on Columbus's northwest corridor, and then to an east-west corridor consisting of Broad and Main Streets. City officials aim for projects like Indianapolis's Red Line (a bus rapid transit line). Federal funding was announced for the two corridors in November 2020, to be released in 2023 and 2024.  \nIn 2021, Amtrak announced plans to connect Columbus to Cleveland and Cincinnati via intercity rail as a part of the American Jobs Plan. Details released in May 2021 describe a thrice-daily service between Cleveland and Cincinnati, stopping at Cleveland's airport, Crestline, Delaware, Columbus, Springfield, Dayton, and Sharonville before terminating in Cincinnati. The service is proposed to be completed by 2035. In anticipation of the plan, the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority released a plan for a Columbus Amtrak station in January 2022. The plan details a $23 million station adjacent to the Greater Columbus Convention Center, to be built if Amtrak's plans are approved. The two-story station would have a single side platform. Other proposals submitted to Amtrak by 2022 include services to Athens, Chillicothe, Toledo, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  \nThe Pittsburgh-Columbus-Chicago corridor is one of ten selected by Virgin Hyperloop One for development of a hyperloop system.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# 2019 Marrakesh ePrix  \nThe 2019 Marrakesh ePrix (formally the 2019 Marrakesh E-Prix) was a Formula E electric car race held at the Circuit International Automobile Moulay El Hassan in the Agdal district of Marrakesh, Morocco on 12 January 2019. It was the second round of the 2018–19 Formula E Championship and the third Marrakesh ePrix. Jérôme d'Ambrosio of Mahindra won the 31-lap race after starting from tenth place. Second place went to Virgin's Robin Frijns and his teammate Sam Bird was third.  \nBird won the pole position by setting the fastest lap in qualifying and held the lead despite Techeetah's Jean-Éric Vergne clattering into his left-hand sidepod and spinning 180 degrees on the race's opening lap. António Félix da Costa of BMW Andretti passed Bird to move into first place on lap ten and pulled away to lead the following fourteen laps until a collision on lap 26 with his teammate Alexander Sims careened him into a barrier. That promoted d'Ambrosio into the lead, which he maintained through a safety car period; he held off Frijns on the final lap to win by 0.143 seconds. It was d'Ambrosio's third career victory and his first without having inherited the win through driver disqualifications.  \nD'Ambrosio's victory put him in the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 40 points. Félix da Costa fell to second and Vergne, who recovered to finish fifth in the race, dropped to third. Vergne's teammate André Lotterer moved up a place to fourth and Frijns moved from twelfth to fifth. In the Teams' Championship, Techeetah led with 47 points, Mahindra and BMW were tied for second as Virgin progressed to fourth with eleven races left in the season.  \n## Background  \nThe Marrakesh ePrix was confirmed as part of the 2018–19 Formula E Championship by the FIA World Motor Sport Council in October 2018. It was the second of thirteen scheduled single-seater electric car races of the 2018–19 Championship, and third annual edition of the event. The ePrix was held at the adj=on anti-clockwise 12-turn semi-permanent Circuit International Automobile Moulay El Hassan street circuit in the Agdal district of the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on 12 January. The track's configuration requires teams to develop their spring rates, anti-roll bar, car ride height and vehicle chassis configuration for maximum mechanical grip. The circuit was unchanged from the 2018 race with the mandatory attack-mode activation zone to provide drivers with extra power for a certain amount of time situated on the outside of turn three and the timing loops to activate the system were made visible to drivers. The driver adviser to the stewards was former Trulli GP driver Vitantonio Liuzzi.  \n<image>Pascal Wehrlein (pictured in 2011) made his Formula E debut for Mahindra.\nAfter winning the season-opening Ad Diriyah ePrix four weeks earlier, BMW Andretti driver António Félix da Costa led the Drivers' Championship with 28 points, ahead of Jean-Éric Vergne of Techeetah with 18 points, and Mahindra's Jérôme d'Ambrosio with 15 points. With 12 points, Mitch Evans for Jaguar was in fourth place and Vergne's teammate André Lotterer was fifth with 10 points. In the Teams' Championship, Techeetah led with 29 points; BMW Andretti were a further point behind in second. Mahindra, Jaguar and e.Dams-Nissan in positions three through five were each separated by a single point. The race saw the introduction of a mandated winglet on the roll hoop of all cars, next to the television camera. The addition came after some teams lobbied the series to free up space on the hoop's side for commercial partners.  \nFollowing a software-related drive-through penalty that lost him a potential victory in Ad Diriyah, Vergne said he was eager to demonstrate his team had the fastest car in Marrakesh, \"Being so close to the victory in the first round has left me very hungry for more, and it’s what my focus is all about right now, Marrakesh hasn’t been a good track for us in the past so I’m hoping that we can change that and leave Morocco on a high note this year. It still  a very long way to go and we know that we need to continue to be razor sharp for the rest of the season.\" D'Ambrosio stated that he thought he could achieve another podium finish in Marrakesh, and aimed to continue improving his performance and maintain Mahindra's strong record at the track: \"It’s a challenging street circuit and, while it hasn’t been the best track for me over the past two years, I’m going to make sure that I change that and I’m looking forward to having a good race this weekend.\"  \nThe second in-season rookie test was scheduled to be held at the circuit the day after the race. Teams were required to field two drivers who were not in possession of an e-licence at the time of the test. There were eleven teams entering two drivers each for the race with a total of 22 competitors. There was one driver change going into the race. Having missed the Ad Diriyah ePrix because his Mercedes-Benz contract barred him from driving with another team until 31 December 2018 without performing certain pre-requisites, 2015 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters champion Pascal Wehrlein replaced the outgoing Felix Rosenqvist at Mahindra; Rosenqvist moved to Chip Ganassi Racing's IndyCar Series team for 2019. Wehrlein spent the week before the race at Mahindra's simulator in Banbury as part of his preparation.\n\n## Practice  \nTwo practice sessions—both on Saturday morning—were held before the late-afternoon race. The first session ran for 45 minutes and the second for half an hour. The first practice session was first held in darkness and cold weather with drivers struggling to get tyre temperature before the sun rose. Robin Frijns of Virgin was fastest with a lap of 1 minute and 17.808 seconds, followed by Félix da Costa, Bird, e.Dams-Nissan's Oliver Rowland, Oliver Turvey for NIO, the Jaguar duo of Evans and Nelson Piquet Jr., Alexander Sims of BMW Andretti, Sebastien Buemi for Nissan and Vergne. During the session, where drivers locked their tyres due to them fine-tuning their brake-by-wire systems, several competitors ran onto the turn seven run-off area because they braked later than usual. Evans avoided contact with a trackside barrier, and his teammate Piquet swerved to avoid hitting Venturi's Felipe Massa who made a late decision to enter the pit lane. With 13 minutes remaining, Wehrlein's car briefly switched off at turn ten and the session was red flagged as he reset his car to allow his return to the pit lane.  \nThe second practice session was held in warmer weather. Evans led with an early benchmark lap which Frijns improved in the final ten minutes. Lotterer then bettered Frijns' lap before Evans ran with 250 kW (340 hp) of power to set a 1-minute and 17.762 seconds lap to go fastest, 0.242 seconds ahead of Lotterer. Buemi, Félix da Costa, Frijns, Rowland, José María López for Dragon, Turvey, Vergne, and Sims completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. As the session passed relatively peacefully, drivers again locked their brakes into turn seven. As Massa activated 250 kW (340 hp) mode, his car shut down on the start/finish straight; he restarted it with radio engineer assistance. Massa's powertrain was later replaced and Lucas di Grassi's Audi had a water pump change.  \n## Qualifying  \nSaturday's 75-minute afternoon qualifying session was divided into two groups of five cars and two groups of six. Each group was determined by a lottery system and given six minutes of on-track activity. All drivers were limited to two timed laps with one at maximum power. The fastest six overall competitors in the four groups participated in a \"Super Pole\" session with one driver on the track at any time going out in reverse order from fifth to first. Each of the five drivers was limited to one timed lap and the starting order was determined by their fastest times; positions six through twenty were determined by group qualifying times. The driver and team who recorded the fastest time were awarded three points towards their respective championships.  \n<image>Sam Bird (pictured in 2015) took the fifth pole position of his career notwithstanding rear diffuser damage from a three-car accident in the pit lane.\nIn the first session to have a direct comparison between the two cars—the preceding Ad Diriyah race was rain-affected—the SRT05e was three seconds a lap faster than the Spark-Renault SRT 01E. In group one, Félix da Costa was fastest, ahead of Vergne, Evans, d'Ambrosio and Lotterer after a driver error at turn seven. Buemi led the second session with Piquet second. Di Grassi had an untidy lap and was third in the group, followed by Rowland. Abt was group two's slowest driver by losing a large amount of time midway on the track. In the third group, Bird set the fastest overall kap in group qualifying at 1 minute and 17.851 seconds despite a minor error in the first turn. His teammate Frijns was second and provisionally sixth overall. The NIO pair of Turvey and Dillmann were third and fourth. Dragon's Maximilian Günther was fifth after hitting a bump on a kerb on the exit to turn six, going airborne briefly, and crashing into the side of a barrier. Stoffel Vandoorne's HWA car shut down halfway through his maximum power lap as he looked set to enter the top ten.  \nAfter group three ended, Dillmann's car had a sudden brake failure en route to parc fermé in the pit lane and he had to decide whether to hit the rear of Frijns' car or a track marshal. He elected to hit Frijns, which caused a chain reaction incident that sent him into the rear of his teammate Bird's car. Bird sustained rear diffuser damage; parc fermé regulations dictated any repairs made to his car would send him to the rear of the grid. In group four, Sims was fastest and he advanced to Super Pole. He demoted Wehrlein to seventh overall after the latter ran over the kerbs at the final corner. López was third; the Venturi duo of Massa and Edoardo Mortara took fourth and fifth. HWA's Gary Paffett was slowest in group four because of a heavy understeer in turn one and electrical energy issues. After group qualifying, Buemi, Sims, Félix da Costa, Vergne and Evans progressed to Super Pole. Bird took the fifth pole position of his career and his first since the second 2017 New York City ePrix race with a 1-minute and 17.489 seconds lap. He was joined on the grid's front row by Vergne who recorded a mistake-free lap. Félix da Costa had an untidy lap and came third. Buemi in fourth was smooth and Sims took fifth. Sixth-place Evans locked his front tyres on the approach to turn seven and ran deep onto the run off-area.\n\n### Post-qualifying  \nAfter qualifying, Félix da Costa was demoted three places on the starting grid because he was adjudged to have exceeded the maximum amount of permitted electrical power on his non-timed lap at abbr=on because of a temporary spike. Hence, the grid lined up after penalties as Bird, Vergne, Buemi, Sims, Evans, Félix da Costa, Wehrlein, Frijns, Piquet, d'Ambrosio, di Grassi, Rowland, López, Turvey, Massa, Abt, Mortara, Dillmann, Paffett, Lotterer, Günther and Vandoorne.  \n### Qualifying classification  \nNotes  \n* 1 — António Félix da Costa was demoted three places for exceeding the amount of permitted power on his non-timed lap.  \n## Race  \nThe race, which lasted 45 minutes plus one full lap after time had elapsed, began at 16:03 Central European Time (UTC+01:00). The weather at the start was hot and clear and the air temperature ranged from F and the track temperature was between F; a 20-per-cent chance of rain was forecast. Each driver was required to use attack mode twice and was permitted to arm the system no more than five times. A special feature of Formula E is the \"Fan Boost\" feature, an additional 25 kW (34 hp) of power to use during the race's second half. The five drivers who were allowed to use the boost were determined by a fan vote. For the Marrakesh race, Vandoorne, Félix da Costa, Massa, Buemi, Wehrlein were handed the extra power. Bird made a good getaway and Buemi drew alongside the fractionally slower Vergne entering the first corner. As he turned to the inside line to block Vergne, it appeared Bird would lead comfortably. Vergne went onto the inside run-off area and clattered into Bird's left-hand sidepod on the turn-one apex at high speed. That caused a small titanium television camera from Vergne's car to detach and lodge itself in the aperture of Bird's left-hand sidepod. Vergne spun 180 degrees, and several drivers swerved to avoid his car.  \n<image>António Félix da Costa (pictured in 2012) led for 15 laps until he and his teammate Alexander Sims made contact on the 26th lap, which he took responsibility for.\nWehrlein's suspension, diffuser, rear tyre bearing and rims were damaged when di Grassi misjudged his braking point for the first turn and rammed into him. An attempt  to continue driving proved impossible and he entered the pit lane to retire. Additionally, Paffett and his HWA teammate Vandoorne were unsighted because of smoke emitted from Vergne's spin, and the two made contact with each other's sidepods in the same area, causing Vandoorne to retire with a broken suspension at the end of the first lap and Paffett to sustain a slow rear-left puncture. Turvey moved from 16th to seventh by the end of the first lap while Vergne's spin dropped him to 19th and Buemi fell to 14th. At the start of lap two, Buemi passed Evans on the inside into turn one for 13th. Lotterer passed Evans soon after and then overtook Buemi into the turn-five and six chicane. On the third lap, a brief yellow flag was waved as Paffett spun exiting the chicane as the slow puncture deteriorated, causing him to retire. Félix da Costa passed his teammate Sims on the inside line at turn three for the second position on the following lap. On lap seven, Günther activated the attack mode, passing Dillmann, Vergne and Massa over the next four laps.  \nGunther's act confirmed to the field that the attack mode was a huge advantage without losing a large amount of time during activation, and a steady trickle of drivers activated the system over the following few laps. On lap ten, López overtook Turvey on the inside for seventh before turn one. That lap, Félix da Costa attempted to pass Bird for the lead on the inside into turn eleven, which Bird blocked and Félix da Costa's right-rear corner hit Bird's left-rear quarter; both continued without any car damage. Félix da Costa tried again going into the turn-four and five chicane on lap 11, and moved past Bird on the inside as the latter cut the corner under braking. Sims got an advantage to overtake Bird and took second on the straight entering turn eight. Abt used the attack mode to pass López on the entry to turn one on lap 12 but López responded by doing the same two laps later. On lap 14, d'Ambrosio went to the inside to pass di Grassi into turn seven for fifth. That prompted Virgin to allow Frijns to take third from his teammate Bird entering turn seven on lap 15. Bird blocked d'Ambrosio from overtaking him for fourth on the outside into turn eleven.  \nOn lap 16, di Grassi activated the attack mode, as d'Ambrosio successfully overtook Bird to move into fourth going into turn eleven, before the latter lost fifth to di Grassi on the start/finish straight. During the 17th lap, d'Ambrosio and d'Grassi got ahead of Frijns at turns seven and on the straight linking turns 10 and 11 to demote him to fifth. Di Grassi began to pressure d'Ambrosio as Bird activated the attack mode, falling to seventh behind López on the next lap. Bird however immediately retook sixth from López entering the turn four and five chicane. As the pack began to close up to the BMWs, Félix da Costa and Sims activated their first attack modes on the 19th lap in an attempt to increase their lead. Frijns and Bird used their second attack mode activation on lap 23, with the two passing di Grassi at the end of the lap, motivated by Vergne moving to sixth. Furthermore, as he caught the battle for third, they were gaining on the BMWs, resulting in a lead change with ten minutes left.\n<image>Jerome d'Ambrosio (pictured in 2011) took the third victory of his career and his first on the track after his previous wins came as a result of driver disqualifications.\nAround this time, BMW Andretti team principal Roger Griffiths liaised with its senior engineering team to consider allowing Sims to pass his teammate Félix da Costa for the lead because he was the faster driver and had better electrical energy management. Despite his team's liaison, Sims, approaching turn seven on the 26th lap, challenged his teammate Félix da Costa for first on the outside as both drivers locked their brakes. This caused Félix da Costa to slide wide and hit the front-left quarter of Sims's car, who had regained control; he could not avoid the former and their front wings interlocked. Félix da Costa careened into a right-side tyre wall and retired. Sims made it through the corner, but fell from second to fourth. D'Ambrosio moved into first with Frijns second. To recover Félix da Costa's car, the race director Scot Elkins ordered the safety car's deployment with seven minutes remaining. The safety car stayed on the track until only 20 seconds were left to run and Sims used their second attack modes beforehand to challenge Bird for third place.  \nOn the final lap, d'Ambrosio locked his tyres at the final corner and held off Frijns to win the race. It was d'Ambrosio's third career victory, his first since the 2016 Mexico City ePrix, and his first on-track win; his previous two came via technical disqualifications involving di Grassi. Frijns was 0.147 seconds behind in second and took the best finish of his career at the time, besting prior third-place finish in the 2015 Putrajaya ePrix. His teammate Bird finished third. Off the podium, Sims took fourth, Vergne completed his recovery to finish fifth and his teammate Lotterer sixth. Di Grassi finished seventh and earned one extra point for setting the race's fastest lap on the final lap, at 1-minute and 20.296 seconds. Buemi, Evans, and Abt rounded out the top ten. The final finishers were López, Günther, Mortara, Piquet, Rowland, Turvey, Dillmann and Massa.\n\n### Post-race  \nThe top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. D'Ambrosio was euphoric over taking his third career victory, \"This is a real win, I fought hard for it and I'm really happy. I've been here since the start of the series and I've been fighting to be in this position. Last year we had some tough moments and I'm happy I can pay the team back like this.\" Frijns said he regretted not challenging d'Ambrosio harder on the final lap. He commented on the importance of his second-place finish for the Virgin team, \"At one point, I was like, 'Shall I go for it at Turn 10?' and then I was like, 'Yeah, but we are P2, team-mate Sam Bird is P3 and I'm not going to be a bully that drives over Jerome and doesn't finish at all'. I think it's smart to not do it at the beginning of the season - just to score the points.\" Third-placed Bird said the camera from Vergne's car lodged in his vehicle possibly affected its handling, \"I didn’t know too much about the move from Vergne at the start and from there on I suspect it may have caused a slight issue with the car as we didn’t have the pace we had seen earlier. Nevertheless, it was an amazing result for the team and we did a great job in qualifying.\"  \n<image>Alexander Sims (pictured in 2009) attributed the clash with his teammate António Félix da Costa to an inter-team communication breakdown.\nBMW Andretti personnel convened immediately after the race to discuss the collision with Félix da Costa and Sims. Félix da Costa apologised to the team, expressed contrition to the press, and conceded Sims was faster than him: \"I'm sorry - that's a mistake and a mistake coming from me only. It's terribly frustrating in this story because we lost a win, we lost a one-two, and even if it was just me, Alex could have won the race. But because of that, I denied him the win, denied the team a one-two. I'm feeling very bad for myself.\" Sims attributed the contact to an intra-team communication breakdown and refused to apportion blame. He additionally stated to the media he did not wish to challenge Félix da Costa because he was conserving electrical energy and was attempting to maintain the gap over the rest of the field. Jens Marquardt, director of BMW Motorsport, said that any similar incidents would not re-occur in the future and the team would learn over the rest of the season. Griffiths later emphasised a priority scenario was non-existent over favouring one driver over the other and praised Félix da Costa for accepting responsibility for the accident.  \nVergne called himself an \"idiot\" for clattering into Bird on the first lap, and stated any similar mistakes would not re-occur in the future: \"I didn't stop the car and I obviously didn't want to crash into Sam, I didn't want to ruin his race, ruin my race and have a penalty for the next race. So I went completely on the inside and obviously I spun because there was no other way. I either spin or take us both out - so I chose that option. It was unnecessary because I clearly had the pace to win today.\" Wehrlein said he was certain he could have finished on the podium had di Grassi not hit him at the start; he enjoyed the weekend as a whole, \"You know, I got to experience Formula E, apart from the race, but I like the formula and again the race was very interesting. It’s a busy day with a lot of driving so I really like that as well but it starts early, I don’t like it so much but you cannot have everything!\"  \nAfter the race, d'Ambrosio on 40 points took the Drivers' Championship lead from Félix da Costa, who now tied with Vergne for second with 28. Lotterer moved to fourth place with 19 points and Frijns moved from twelfth to fifth. In the Teams' Championship, Techeetah continued to lead with 47 points; Mahindra moved from third to second, displacing BMW Andretti, which tied Mahindra with 40 points. Virgin's results progressed the team to fourth while e.Dams-Nissan fell to fifth with eleven races left in the season.\n\n### Race classification  \nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold.  \n* 2 — Pole position.  \n* 3 — Fastest lap.  \n## Standings after the race  \nDrivers' Championship standings  \nTeams' Championship standings  \n* Notes: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.\n\nQuestion: Which driver made his Formula E debut for Mahindra and spent the week before the race at Mahindra's simulator in Banbury as part of his preparation?\nChoice list: \nA.
